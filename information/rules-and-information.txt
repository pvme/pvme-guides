**__Rules__**
1. Do not discuss means of breaking Runescape rules, such as means of botting/RWT, bug abuse and scamming/luring.
2. No explicit NSFW content. This includes all media (picture/video/link), Discord avatars, and discussions of extreme obscenity. When in doubt, use spoiler tags and clearly state as such.
3. Zero tolerance for malicious behavior. This includes trolling, harassment, racist and sexist remarks, excessive spam/copypasta, and content that involves hostile targeting of specific users.
4. Contact @ Owners and @ Moderator if any issues arise. The best way to do this is via DM (direct message).
5. Refrain from pinging Jagex Moderators unless absolutely necessary. 
6. No begging or asking for loans, clan/Discord recruitment, or wilderness-related activities (dangerous PvP).
7. Avoid advertising teams here, as this is not a team forming server. Use the affiliate servers for more information on teamfinding.
8. Your RSN must be a part of either your nickname or your Discord profile username. Any appropriate nickname is acceptable as long as your RSN is identifiable.
9. Do not attempt to backseat moderate. This includes witchhunting or arguing with rulebreakers. If issues arise, please DM a staff member.
10. No memes. To be specific, this means pointless content that contributes nothing to discussion will be deleted. Repeated offenses will result in mutes. <#606208178526617664> is available to nitro boosters, however.
11. Combat discussions should be kept to EoC only. 

All circumstances of rule-breaking are to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Staff members have all rights to further investigate the issue if necessary.

**__Goals of the Server__**

In creating this server, we came in with two main goals. 
1. To create a collection of up to date, quality guides for every boss in RuneScape.
