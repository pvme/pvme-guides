Welcome to the road to becoming an editor! Editors are the people who make new guides, and keep old guides up to date. This channel will describe the workflow of editing, and how you can contribute to the server.

**__How to Edit:__**
Once you are an editor, you will have access to new channels where you can find lots of resources to help you format your writeups.
*Note: Utilize the style guide channel to help with formatting*

⬥ Our guides are all sourced in Github, but using it is entirely optional for publishing changes to guides.

⬥ Most people write their portion of the edits for a channel in the notepad app.
    • Check your work by using the command pvme$txtpost [attach the saved notepad document you worked on]
    • Once happy with the edits, either copy paste your document text into the section of github you want to change, or ask someone to do it for you. Just doing the writeup in the notepad app is already a huge help.

**__Writing Rotations__**
⬥ https://pvme.github.io/rotation-builder/ is a website we use to build rotations for the guides. It uses emojis which can be found in an organized list in the editor channels.
    • Instructions are in the website but if you get stumped, feel free to ask for help.
    • Please copy paste the input text into the editor channel once you are happy with what the output looks like so we can save it for future editing.

⬥ A Github tutorial will be provided if you choose to use it for publishing your own changes.

⬥ You do not need to be a great PvMer to help edit guides.
