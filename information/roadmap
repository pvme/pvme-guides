> **__No ETA__**
The following list details the desires and plans that the PvM Encyclopedia staff would like to bring to life.

⬥ **Combat Tutorial:** An in-depth channel tailored for the returning players to RuneScape, or players wishing to understand combat fundamentals. Aimed to not be overwhelming, while also giving the option for in-depth if the reader choses to.

⬥ **Subcategories via threads:** Massively reduce the number of channels through thread usage. Huge back-end and front-end work is needed for this to be functional.

⬥ **Video Narration:** Working with content creators to turn some guides into video format is something we're very interested in. Choosing the desired guide, making a script and ensuring its accessibility and information isn't compromised is part of the process.

⬥ **Announcements in the website:** Back-end work is needed for this to work.
