.tag:intro
Croesus is general of the Bik front in the elder god wars and has the unique attribute of being a skilling boss. There is no combat involved in the fight, instead the fishing, mining, woodcutting, and hunter skills are used to gather material in order to repair statues that subdue the boss, allowing you to damage its core through skilling.

The boss is massable, however the recomended group size starts at 8, going down to 4 once you are comfortable with the fight.
