*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the basic mechanics of Kerapac which can be seen here <#1020559705204076614>.

It is recommended to have a Nodon Dragonkin slayer task <:slayer:797896049548066857> as the helmet boost does work. You may also use the Premier Artefact <:premierartefact:918517285176623104> to have a 10% chance to not decrease the slayer task count with each kill. Headhunter's thrill bracelets may be used as a switch in order to prolong slayer tasks. The Trophy-Taker's perk also does the same.
