> **__Introduction__**
.
Following the <:Magic:689504724159823906> combat style's rapid rise to top of the meta, causing increased <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> usability, Glacors have quickly become one of the best slayer monsters to kill for gold, especially as an AFK option in the Elder God Wars dungeon with low equipment requirements relative to many other comparable AFK methods.

They attack with low to moderate-damage melee <:melee:615612332521029632>, ranged <:range:580168050121113623>, and magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attacks.

**__Stats__**

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
.tag:drops
⬥ Glacors have multiple high-value unique drops, including:
.
    • <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> **Shards of Armadyl** - Dropped at a rate of approximately 1/9.6 per kill.
.
    • **Glacyte Boots** - Dropped at a rate of 3/1280 per kill, or approximately 1/209 when holding a Most Wanted Card (Glacor).
.    
    • <:eldertrovewent3:869284271452479488> **Elder Trove (Wen, T3)** - Dropped at a rate of 8 per hour with the fully upgraded <:pontifexshadowring:870326852361789501> while at the Glacor Front.
.    
    • <:pernixsquiver:902209626450296892> **Fragments of Pernix's Quiver** - Though not directly dropped by Glacors, these drop at a rate of approximately 1/9.5 from Elder Trove (Wen, T3).

.
⬥ Shards of Armadyl are a slot on the Lost Lands and Dungeons slayer collection log, and all three boots are slots on both the Lost Lands and Dungeons and Senntisten slayer collection logs.

***Note: Ritual of the Mahjarrat is required to receive Shards of Armadyl, the bulk of the profit from this monster, even at the Glacor Front.***

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
.
Glacors are located in the Glacor Cave, accessible through Fairy Ring code DKQ; or at the Glacor Front in the Elder God Wars Dungeon, accessible south of the Senntisten cathedral or north of the Arch-Glacor <:archglacor:891948878583189514>

Each area has pros and cons:
.
    • The Glacor Cave has many more spawns and has a passive damage boost, but it is impossible to reliably afk and Elder Troves cannot be received.
.
    • The Glacor Front only has 4 spawns and there is no damage boost, but Elder Troves will boost gp/hr greatly and it is possible to afk for very low effort income.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
⬥ **Fire Spell Weakness** - Similar to Ice Strykewyrms, Glacors take increased damage from Fire Spells (<:FireSurge:543465116092334083>, <:bloodburst:841419289714098246>, <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) and are likewise completely immune to Water Spells (<:iceburst:841419289797197824>, <:icebarrage:537340400185245701>, <:incitefear:856635090783567902>). Because of this, Magic is by far the preferred style to use while fighting Glacors.

.
⬥ **Binding Auto attacks** - Periodically, Glacor auto attacks will apply a bind. This can be either completely ignored, or cleared with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.

.
⬥ **Ice Spikes** - Periodically, Glacors may launch a slow moving icicle projectile at the player which will cause a cluster of Ice Spikes to erupt from the ground dealing 50% of the player's current life points as typeless damage. This can either be ignored or avoided by moving from the tile that was stood on when the icicle was launched.

.
⬥ **Block of Ice** - While in Melee Distance, Glacors may encase players in a block of ice and begin charging a big attack. This special attack is very similar to Araxxor's cacoon special attack, and can only be broken free from by spam clicking. This attack will never occur outside of melee distance.

.
⬥ **Glacytes** - Once damaged to 20,000 Life Points, the Glacor will spawn three different minions, each with a unique special property. The Glacor is immune to all damage until all three glacytes are defeated, and will inherit the special property of the last glacyte killed. Unlike the main Glacor, these monsters do not take extra damage from fire spells.

.

.
    • **Enduring Glacyte** - The Enduring Glacyte takes significantly reduced damage depending on its proximity to the main Glacor, being completely immune to damage if in melee distance to it. Unlike the other two types, Enduring Glacytes are not aggressive to the player when they spawn, and must be damaged to lure them away from the main Glacor.
.
    • **Sapping Glacyte** - The Sapping Glacytes drains 20 prayer points with every auto attack.
.
    • **Unstable Glacyte** - The Unstable Glacytes will explode, dealing AoE typeless damage equal to 33% of the players current life points if the bar under its life point bar fills up completely. This attack will also damage nearby glacytes.

.

.
Aside from smart usage of Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> and general cooldown management, the primary difficulty of achieving optimal Glacor KPH is effective dispatching of Glacytes.
.
Loosely following a rotation similar to this one, it is possible to reach 180-200 KPH.

<:bloodburst:841419289714098246> <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Threshold → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> / <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> → Glacytes spawn

*(Note: Rotate using one of these rotations to dispatch glacytes, depending on available abilities.)*
(Target Enduring Glacyte) (wand) <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> <:deto:535533833358016512> → (4t) (staff) <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> <:deto:535533833358016512>
(Target Enduring Glacyte) <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
(Target Enduring Glacyte) <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>
    • Following this, finish off remaining glacytes, prioritizing Enduring first.

(Target Glacor) <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Threshold → Strong Basics

*Note: It is impossible to target more than one Glacor at a time. Furthermore, you have to wait for the entire death animation to finish before you can target a new Glacor.*

.tag:afk
.
This method relies on the ability to set up an Oldak coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> to aggro the Glacors at the Glacor Front of the Elder God Wars Dungeon. Though requiring Ritual of the Mahjarrat to receive the most valuable drops, this method has very low gear requirements relative to other AFK methods that offer comparable GP/Hr rates. It utilizes as many long range area of effect abilities as possible, as well as damage from the Oldak coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194>, in order to dispatch glacytes without having to target them.

Utilizing this method will result in 70-75 KPH AFK.

⬥ **AFK Preset**
*(Note: Downgrade gear as necessary.)*
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ERHozrV.png
.
    • <:gchain:787904334495088672> **Greater Chain** - Though not strictly necessary, usage of this ability will greatly increase the reliability of killing glacytes swiftly.
.    
    • <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> **Berserker's Fury Relic** - Many special attacks will reduce life points greatly, allowing consistent use of this relic for additional damage.
.    
    • **Restocking Royale Cannon upgrade** - Received from Artisans' Workshop. This will greatly increase AFK time using this method.
.    
    • <:coilupgradekit:869284271674785842> **Oldak Coil Upgrade Kit** - Increases the reliability of killing glacytes quickly.
.    
    • <:pontifexshadowring:870326852361789501> **Pontifex Shadow Ring** - Fully charging this ring with 1,000 of each type of resonant anima will allow Glacors to drop Elder Trove (Wen, T3) at a rate of 8 per hour. This ring must be worn in order to receive its benefits, unless it is overcharged with 5,000 of each type of resonant anima.
.    
    • <:caroming4:791281588792590336> **Caroming 1+** - This allows all three glacytes to be targeted with Chain, ensuring the enduring glacyte is dealt with very slightly quicker than without the perk.
.    
    • **Normal Magic Spellbook** - This allows the use of Telekinetic grab <:telekeneticgrab:866551637970255872>, allowing much easier looting without having to move from your spot.
.    
    • **Ancient Magic Spellbook** - This allows the use of Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> and Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, allowing for more consistent kills using significantly lower-end gear set ups.

.
**__Action Bar - Staff__**
.
This action bar should be used with 2H magic weapons. The bis 2H magic weapon against Glacors is the Inquisitor staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>, but most weapons will work. This bar takes advantage of Sonic Wave <:sonicwave:1087373972443775056> not delaying revolution for a tick, unlike Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>, allowing for more AoE abilities to be spammed on time.

*Note: Magma Tempest can be completely omitted if not owned.*
