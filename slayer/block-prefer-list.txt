# Block and Prefer Lists
.tag:intro
*Note: The following block/prefer lists are just examples, it’s always more efficient to make your own.*

⬥ It's assumed the player will slay Moss Golems for Creatures of the Lost Grove tasks and Ripper Demons for Demon cluster tasks, as well as bringing Binding Contracts <:bindingcontract:1073883118521557052> for GP.
⬥ These lists are made for use with Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426>
    • Before level 90, when you can't use her as your Slayer Master, its generally not worth thinking too hard about your block/prefer list, and you can just block tasks you don't like or find unrewarding.

### Personalized Spreadsheet
.tag:spreadsheet
⬥ Configuring the spreadsheet below is an easy way to find the best Block/Prefer list for your personal use.
⬥ Be aware of the Slayer collection log while blocking monsters, and whether it's something you have interest in filling out or not.
    • If the Slayer collection log *is* something you're interested in doing, check out our [full guide](https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1197563914934821025) on obtaining Ultimate Slayer, which has an alternative block/prefer list included.

### Additional Information
.tag:miscinfo
.
⬥ Players start with a only a few slots to block/prefer monsters, gaining 1 of each every 50 Quest Points achieved, up to a maximum of 8 slots to block and prefer monsters at 400 Quest Points.
⬥ Don't be afraid to skip undesired or bad assignments, as you can skip around half of the tasks given by Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426> without losing many Slayer points overall, and they can be farmed with relative ease, making it unnecessary to force yourself to do any tasks you dislike.
⬥ The assignment given by your Slayer Master is **not** completely random, a system unique to each Slayer Master known as **weighting** is used to make some assignments more common than others, and may be a factor in what the player chooses to block/prefer.
    • The higher the weighting, the more common the assignment compared to others, the weighting for each task a Slayer Master has can be viewed on their page of the RuneScape Wiki.
    • As we can see from the image below, Jacquelyn <:jacquelyn:975284345369665577> has a slightly higher chance to assign us Cows, Goblins, or Zombies.
