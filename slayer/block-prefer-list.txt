### Additional Information
.tag:miscinfo
.
⬥ The player can boost up to 6 levels with the use of a Wilder Pie, this is especially helpful for killing higher leveled Slayer mobs during cluster tasks for better XP/GP rates, such as boosting to kill Moss Golems for the Creatures of the Lost Grove assignment.
⬥ Laniakea's special assignment is very good for Slayer XP/points and should always be completed. Morvran's special assignment is mostly a waste of time, and should be toggled off after being completed once for the completionist cape requirement.
⬥ Don't be afraid to skip undesired or bad assignments, as you can skip around half of the tasks given by Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426> without losing many Slayer points overall, and they can be farmed with relative ease, making it unnecessary to force yourself to do any tasks you dislike.
