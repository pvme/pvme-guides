# Block and Prefer Lists
.tag:intro
*Note: The following block/prefer lists are just examples, it’s always more efficient to make your own.*

⬥ It's assumed the player will slay Moss Golems for Creatures of the Lost Grove tasks and Ripper Demons for Demon cluster tasks, as well as bringing Binding Contracts <:bindingcontract:1073883118521557052> for GP.
⬥ These lists are made for use with Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426>, before level 90, when you can use her as your Slayer Master, its generally not worth thinking too hard about your block/prefer list, and you can just block tasks you don't like or find unrewarding.

### Personalized Spreadsheet
.tag:spreadsheet
⬥ Configuring the spreadsheet below is an easy way to find the best Block/Prefer list for your personal use.
⬥ Be aware of the Slayer collection log while blocking monsters, and whether it's something you have interest in filling out or not, as to avoid blocking monsters that drop an item needed for a log, only to find out long after.
    • If the Slayer collection log *is* something you're interested in doing, check out our [full guide](https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1197563914934821025) on obtaining Ultimate Slayer, which has an alternative block/prefer list included.

### Additional Information
.tag:miscinfo
.
⬥ Players start with a only a few slots to block/prefer monsters, gaining 1 of each every 50 Quest Points achieved, up to a maximum of 8 slots to block and prefer monsters at 400 Quest Points.
⬥ Don't be afraid to skip undesired or bad assignments, as you can skip around half of the tasks given by Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426> without losing many Slayer points overall, and they can be farmed with relative ease, making it unnecessary to force yourself to do any tasks you dislike.
⬥ The assignment given by your Slayer Master is **not** completely random, a system unique to each Slayer Master known as **weighting** is used to make some assignments more common than others, and may be a factor in what the player chooses to block/prefer.
    • The higher the weighting, the more common the assignment compared to others, the weighting for each task a Slayer Master has can be viewed on their page of the RuneScape Wiki.
    • As we can see from the image below, Jacquelyn <:jacquelyn:975284345369665577> has a slightly higher chance to assign us Cows, Goblins, or Zombies.
