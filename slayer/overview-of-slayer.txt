.
> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Slayer is a combat-based skill, where XP is awarded for killing the mobs tasked to you by a slayer master, with harder mobs generally giving more XP. Slayer is a skill where high effort rewards high XP rates, and afk methods offer lower XP rates, so gaining <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP is proportional to the effort put in. As such, AOE damage is king.

To start with, using your highest level slayer master is always advised, with the exception of Mandrith who only offers wilderness tasks. Some tasks are higher weighted than others, so the tables on the wiki should be used to check which tasks are more likely to appear, blocking the tasks that have high weight but low XP/h. Early Slayer tasks offer poor XP rates, so the player should aim to gain slayer XP from other methods, such as squashing Scarabs in Menaphos, Reaper tasks or completing quests. Most tasks below level 85 offer low XP mobs, however a greater demon task can be used to power level slayer with the aid of the Demon Flashmobs distraction & diversion. If the player with the greater demon task is the first person to tag the boss, they will recieve the full 22.4k XP, which can be increased to 33.6k XP with the scrimshaw of sacrifice. With these methods, low-level, poor XP tasks can be avoided.

Since AoE damage is the king of slayer, a lot of lower and higher levelled slayer tasks are generally done with melee, with a halberd weapon, making melee the main overall style when slaying. However, both magic and ranged have their own sets of tasks that they are best for, especially at the higher end, so all three styles are recommended to be used.

**__Basic Ranged Afk Bar__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/FqErGwm.png
.
*Note: Specific tasks may require their own action bars, due to requiring certain abilities like Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> or Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> in a specific spot, or if AoE is not required. These bars should be taken as a baseline and not as the absolute best bar. The ranged bar assumes 1v1 combat, as AoE ranged is usually in the form of Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. If gFury <:gfury:535532879334080527> is not owned, shift everything up one slot and put Slice <:slice:535532879594258432> at the end.*

.
> **__Slayer Tips__**
.tag:tips
**__General Tips and Tricks__**
⬥ There are a lot of tasks that benefit from using aggression potions to lure mobs together, often in conjunction with the Dwarven Multicannon <:cannon:869283142350041098> or Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> to achieve a stronger effect.

.
⬥ Prayer restoring items, such as Super Restores <:restore:642708657825644554> or Super Prayer Renewals are extremely cheap, so prayers should always be used when slaying.

.
⬥ As soon as the player hits 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, the highest priority is to obtain the Dinosaur Tooth drop, a 1/800 drop from slayer creatures on Anachronia. The droprate is further boosted under the effect of the Osseous Roar, to 1/720. Whilst 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857> is not required, the lowest level slayer creature on anachronia is level 90 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, Venomous dinosaurs are easily afk-able and give high kph. The Dinosaur Tooth is used to build the slayer helmet stand, which allows the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> buff to be available at all times without wearing it, making it extremely ideal for all slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Slayer points should be spent
    • Firstly on building a good block + prefer list, unlocking good tasks such as Nightmare creatures, and upgrading the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792>.
    • After that, tooltbelt upgrades for the seedicide, gold accumulator, bonecrusher and charming imp, then abilities such as broader fletching and crafting slayer rings.
    • If the player plans to do Gargoyles early on, Finishing blows is a higher priority, however a Legendary Pet can be used for the same effect without purchasing the ability.

.
> **__Armours__**
.tag:armour
**__Recommendations__**
⬥ **T70 GW1 Armour** <:subjgarb:643151011199975434> / <:armaplate:643150997828403231> / <:bandoschest:643151021748518917> - Cheap but good gear, these armours are ideal for most slayer tasks, providing suitable armour, augmentable for perks, and good damage bonus.

.
⬥ **Custom-Fit Trimmed Masterwork** <:tmwbody:643847118196441088> - exceptionally powerful slayer armour due to it's non-degrade whilst on task feature, highest level armour in the game currently.

.
*Note: Never use hybrid armour, the damage gained from slayer perks does not cover damage lost by not using power armour, most slayer perks are cheap and t70 gear has a low drain rate which suffices for most tasks. If necessary, an item such as Akrisae's Robe Skirt can be used with universal perks.*

.
> **__Useful Items for Slayer__**
.tag:items
**__Gear__**
⬥ **Slayer Helm** <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> - The single strongest piece of gear, vital for any slayer task. Highest tier provides a 14.5% damage and accuracy boost to mobs whilst on task.

.
**__Introduction__**
⬥ This method consists of doing 9 slayer tasks with Jacquelyn <:jacquelyn:975284345369665577> (Lumbridge Slayer Master), followed by the 10th task with Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426> (highest-level Slayer Master, requiring level 90 <:slayer:797896049548066857> and 120 <:combat:797896050370281523>).
    • This is done to take advantage of the 10th and 50th task points bonus (110 and 330 respectively, from Laniakea), while doing the nine tasks in between as fast as possible.
        - Ideally, you set up a block list that allows you to do all of Jacquelyn tasks inside the Lumbridge Catacombs, and use the NPC Contact spell to receive a new one without leaving the catacombs, speeding this up further.

⬥ This method can net you an average of 660 slayer points/hour.

.

**__Method__**
⬥ **Jacquelyn <:jacquelyn:975284345369665577> (1-9th tasks)**
    • Start by going to the Lumbridge Catacombs by teleporting to the Lumbridge Lodestone and walking south to the cemetery.
    • Once inside, climb down stairs twice to reach the lower catacombs.
    • There, <:SBS:543875425055670275> + <:npccontact:975284195280695326> to get assigned your first task.
        - If you do not have <:npccontact:975284195280695326> unlocked, get your tasks directly from Jacquelyn, who is located at the Lumbridge's castle entrance, by teleporting via the <:slayercape:975284344123953164> or Lumbridge Lodestone.
    • This method can be done efficiently in two ways.
        - It can be done with Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> using the preset and action bar above
        - Alternatively, it can be done with Melee <:melee:615612332521029632> by killing the mobs with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> while using an halberd-style weapon (e.g. <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>) and Laceration boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400> for the increased AoE (5x5)

.
⬥ **Laniakea <:laniakea:975284345411600426> (10th task)**
    • After completing your 9 tasks with Jacquelyn, you must go to Laniakea to get assigned your 10th task.
    • To get there, teleport using the <:slayercape:975284344123953164> or the Anachronia lodestone and walk NE to the slayer lodge inside your base camp.
        - It is highly advised that you use either slayer maks (namely Abyss, Dagannoth or Ganodermic) or Slayer VIP Tickets <:slayervip:975284344597934120> to get assigned quick tasks, maximizing your slayer points/hour.
        - Using the Slayer Introspection relic <:slayerintrospection:975284345365471232> in order to select the minimum amount of kills for each assignment will further speed up this method.
        - If owned, <:slayercape:975284344123953164> can be useful aswell due to its 20% chance to choose what your next task will be.
