.
**__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Slayer is a combat-based skill, where XP is awarded for killing the mobs tasked to you by a slayer master, with harder mobs generally giving more XP. Slayer is a skill where high effort rewards high XP rates, and afk methods offer lower XP rates, so gaining <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP is proportional to the effort put in. As such, AOE damage is king.

To start with, using your highest level slayer master is always advised, with the exception of Mandrith who only offers wilderness tasks. Some tasks are higher weighted than others, so the tables on the wiki should be used to check which tasks are more likely to appear, blocking the tasks that have high weight but low XP/h. Early Slayer tasks offer poor XP rates, so the player should aim to gain slayer XP from other methods, such as squashing Scarabs in Menaphos, Reaper tasks or completing quests. Most tasks below level 85 offer low XP mobs, however a greater demon task can be used to power level slayer with the aid of the Demon Flashmobs distraction & diversion. If the player with the greater demon task is the first person to tag the boss, they will recieve the full 22.4k XP, which can be increased to 33.6k XP with the scrimshaw of sacrifice. With these methods, low-level, poor XP tasks can be avoided.

Since AoE damage is the king of slayer, a lot of lower and higher levelled slayer tasks are generally done with melee, with a halberd weapon, making melee the main overall style when slaying. However, both magic and ranged have their own sets of tasks that they are best for, especially at the higher end, so all three styles are recommended to be used.

.tag:presets
Some basic presets are shown below

⬥Basic melee preset
 

⬥Basic magic preset


⬥Basic ranged preset

*Note: The gear shown above isn't indicative of what one should wear on every slayer task, as many tasks require specific gear or items, the presets are just a general idea of what to remember to take with you. Items in x box represent potions that should be taken to every task, weapons and amulets that should be considered are in y box. The z box is relevant for cannon-able tasks, and a box represents items that should be taken to all tasks, especially the slayer cape for a quick teleport to a slayer master.*

Some base action bars are shown below

⬥Basic magic afk bar

⬥Basic ranged afk bar
.img:https://i.imgur.com/FqErGwm.png
*Note: that specific tasks may require their own action bars, due to requiring certain abilities like <:devo:513190158728953857> or <:anti:535541306475151390> in a specific spot, or if AoE is not required. These bars should be taken as a baseline and not as the absolute best bar. The ranged bar assumes 1v1 combat, as AoE ranged is usually in the form of Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. If <:gfury:535532879334080527> is not owned, shift everything up one slot and put <:slice:535532879594258432> at the end.*

> **General tips and tricks**
.tag:tips
⬥ There are a lot of tasks that benefit from using aggression potions to lure mobs together, often in conjunction with the <:cannon:798285653418573865> or <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> to achieve a stronger effect.

⬥ Prayer restoring items, such as <:restore:642708657825644554> or Super Prayer Renewals are extremely cheap, so prayers should always be used when slaying.

⬥ As soon as the player hits 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, the highest priority is to obtain the Dinosaur Tooth drop, a 1/800 drop from slayer creatures on Anachronia. The droprate is further boosted under the effect of the Osseous Roar, to 1/720. Whilst 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857> is not required, the lowest level slayer creature on anachronia is level 90 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, Venomous dinosaurs are easily afk-able and give high kph. The Dinosaur Tooth is used to build the slayer helmet stand, which allows the <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> buff to be available at all times without wearing it, making it extremely ideal for all slayer tasks.

⬥ Slayer points should be spent firstly on building a good block + prefer list, unlocking good tasks such as Nightmare creatures, and upgrading the <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792>. After that, tooltbelt upgrades for the seedicide, gold accumulator, bonecrusher and charming imp, then abilities such as broader fletching and crafting slayer rings. 
    • If the player plans to do Gargoyles early on, Finishing blows is a higher priority, however a Legendary Pet can be used for the same effect without purchasing the ability.

.
> **Armours**
.tag:armour
⬥ T70 GW1 <:subjgarb:643151011199975434>/<:armaplate:643150997828403231>/<:bandoschest:643151021748518917> - Cheap but good gear, these armours are ideal for most slayer tasks, providing suitable armour, augmentable for perks, and good damage bonus.
⬥ Custom-Fit Trimmed Masterwork <:tmwbody:643847118196441088> - exceptionally powerful slayer armour due to it's non-degrade whilst on task feature, highest level armour in the game currently.
⬥ Never use hybrid armour, the gain from slayer perks is lost by not using power armour, most slayer perks are cheap and t70 gear has a low drain rate which suffices for most tasks. If necessary, an item such as Akrisae's Robe Skirt can be used with universal perks.

> **Useful items for slayer:**
.tag:items
**__Gear__**
