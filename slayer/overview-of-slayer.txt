.tag:intro
Slayer is a combat-based skill, where XP is awarded for killing the mobs tasked to you by a slayer master, with harder mobs generally giving more XP. Slayer is a skill where high effort rewards high XP rates, and afk methods offer lower XP rates, so gaining <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP is proportional to the effort put in. As such, AOE damage is king.

To 💦 start 🅱💦 with, 😂😠 using 📤 your 👯👉 highest 🤠 level slayer 💦 master is 👏🅱 always advised, with 😍😤 the 👭👏 exception of 😱 Mandrith who ❓😂 only offers wilderness tasks. Some tasks are 🏼🍑 higher 🔝✅ weighted than 👨👉 others, 👈 so 💝🅱 the 💡 tables on 🔛🤖 the wiki should be 🐝 used to 💦👌 check ☑✔ which 🥙✌ tasks are 😩 more 🤹 likely to appear, blocking the 🚟 tasks that ☝ have 😄😄 high ⏫☝ weight but 🍑 low 👇 XP/h. Early 🥂🕐 Slayer tasks offer poor 💸 XP rates, 💰😂 so the 🖼 player ♀👨 should 🈶👑 aim to gain slayer XP from other 💰💰 methods, such as squashing Scarabs in Menaphos, Reaper tasks or 🏻💁 completing quests. Most 💯❄ tasks below 😫😫 level 🔻🍒 85 offer low ⬇⬇ XP mobs, however 💯 a 👌👨 greater demon 👹 task 🚜 can 💯 be ✔😡 used 📅 to power 💯🔥 level 🍒🍒 slayer with 💦👬 the aid of the ❗👏 Demon Flashmobs distraction & diversion. If 🤥 the 🅰⏪ player with 💦 the greater demon task 🐴🐴 is the 😱🏠 first 🥇 person 🚫 to 😔 tag 🔞🔞 the 👨👏 boss, they 👧👵 will recieve the 🖕👏 full 🈵👏 22.4k XP, which 👌🙌 can 🔫 be increased ➕ to 33.6k XP with 👏👏 the 👑 scrimshaw of sacrifice. With 😉💦 these 😤🖌 methods, low-level, 👇 poor 😥👨 XP tasks can 💦 be 🌈 avoided.
.
Since AoE damage ☠ is 🏻😍 the king 👑 of 🔧🔴 slayer, 💦 a 🅰🅰 lot 🍑🍑 of lower ⬇ and 🆗 higher ✅🔝 levelled slayer 🍆💦 tasks are 💯 generally done with 👏💯 melee, with 🙀 a 🏽 halberd weapon, ⚔ making 👩 melee the 👏🔫 main overall style when ⤴🍑 slaying. However, both 🌜🍆 magic ✨ and ranged have 🔒😝 their ⬅ own 🙁🏳 sets of tasks that 🛣 they are ❓👏 best for, especially 🙌😈 at 🍆🍗 the higher end, 🔚 so all three styles are recommended to be used. 🙄

*Note: The gear shown above isn't indicative of what one should wear on every slayer task, as many tasks require specific gear or items, the presets are just a general idea of what to remember to take with you. Items in x box represent potions that should be taken to every task, weapons and amulets that should be considered are in y box. The z box is relevant for cannon-able tasks, and a box represents items that should be taken to all tasks, especially the slayer cape for a quick teleport to a slayer master.*

Some base 🙄😢 action 🤚💪 bars are 💯 shown 🚫 below ⬇😫

**__Basic Ranged Afk Bar__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/FqErGwm.png
.
*Note: Specific tasks may require their own action bars, due to requiring certain abilities like Devotion :devo:513190158728953857> or Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> in a specific spot, or if AoE is not required. These bars should be taken as a baseline and not as the absolute best bar. The ranged bar assumes 1v1 combat, as AoE ranged is usually in the form of Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. If gFury <:gfury:535532879334080527> is not owned, shift everything up one slot and put Slice <:slice:535532879594258432> at the end.*

.tag:tips
**__General Tips and Tricks__**
⬥ There are a lot of tasks that benefit from using aggression potions to lure mobs together, often in conjunction with the Dwarven Multicannon <:cannon:798285653418573865> or Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> to achieve a stronger effect.

.
⬥ Prayer restoring items, such as Super Restores <:restore:642708657825644554> or Super Prayer Renewals are extremely cheap, so prayers should always be used when slaying.

.
⬥ As soon as the player hits 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, the highest priority is to obtain the Dinosaur Tooth drop, a 1/800 drop from slayer creatures on Anachronia. The droprate is further boosted under the effect of the Osseous Roar, to 1/720. Whilst 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857> is not required, the lowest level slayer creature on anachronia is level 90 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, Venomous dinosaurs are easily afk-able and give high kph. The Dinosaur Tooth is used to build the slayer helmet stand, which allows the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> buff to be available at all times without wearing it, making it extremely ideal for all slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Slayer points 💯📝 should 🅱 be 🚫☃ spent
    • Firstly on building a good block + prefer list, unlocking good tasks such as Nightmare creatures, and upgrading the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792>.
    • After 🏻😡 that, 🚬 tooltbelt upgrades for the 👏🏿 seedicide, gold 🏆🔦 accumulator, bonecrusher and 😍👏 charming imp, then abilities such 😏 as broader fletching and crafting slayer 💦 rings. 👂 
    • If 👻 the 👑👭 player 💰🏋 plans 📆📒 to 🔢💦 do 🏻🤔 Gargoyles early 🥂🕐 on, Finishing blows is 😧 a 💦👌 higher priority, ⬆⬆ however a 🏿🕦 Legendary Pet can 👍🔫 be 💰 used for 🍆 the 👻♂ same ♀💩 effect 📣📣 without purchasing the 👏💳 ability. 👉👉

.
> **__Armours__**
.tag:armour
**__Recommendations__**
⬥ **T70 GW1 Armour** <:subjgarb:643151011199975434>/<:armaplate:643150997828403231>/<:bandoschest:643151021748518917> - Cheap but good gear, these armours are ideal for most slayer tasks, providing suitable armour, augmentable for perks, and good damage bonus.

.
⬥ **Custom-Fit Trimmed Masterwork** <:tmwbody:643847118196441088> - exceptionally powerful slayer armour due to it's non-degrade whilst on task feature, highest level armour in the game currently.

.
*Note: Never use hybrid armour, the gain from slayer perks is lost by not using power armour, most slayer perks are cheap and t70 gear has a low drain rate which suffices for most tasks. If necessary, an item such as Akrisae's Robe Skirt can be used with universal perks.*

.
> **__Useful Items for Slayer__**
.tag:items
**__Gear__**
⬥ **Slayer Helm** <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> - The single strongest piece of gear, vital for any slayer task. Highest tier provides a 14.5% damage and accuracy boost to mobs whilst on task.
