**__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
⬥ There ✔👈 are 6 Soul 👻 Devourer types, 🅱 between Slayer levels 105 to 117, alongside the 👩 ability 👉 to ✌💦 kill 🔫💞 the ⛓ Magister at 😁👨 115 Slayer. 🍆🍆 Each 👋 mob offers a ❔🅱 different 🏼👎 level 🆙🔻 of 🅱🍨 AFK-ability and 👏👏 GP rates, 😂💰 so the 🚟👏 choice 🔢🔠 of which 👏🤤 to 👉💦 kill is up to 💦 the 💪 player. 🏋👨 The 🍆 types 🅱🅱 that are 🙏 recommended to kill 🔪🙃 will 🍆 be 😝🐝 listed below.

.
⬥ The Magister can also be killed on a Soul Devourer task at 115 slayer for 8000 <:slayer:797896049548066857>XP, and can achieve decent XP/h rates, however the only benefit of being on-task is the use of <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, as the <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> effect does not work on him.

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Soul Devourers are one of the sources that drop the Key to the Crossing and Vital Sparks <:vitalspark:656426807893032963>, adding a lot of value to each task. Keys are dropped at a rate of 1/75 on task, which can be increased to 1/60 with the usage of Sophanem Slayer dungeon drop enhancers. Vital sparks are uncommon drops, and can be doubled via the use of Vital Spark enhancers, which can be purchased with dungeoneering tokens alongside the key enhancers.

.
⬥ In addition ➕➕ to this, 😞👈 Soul 👼👻 Devourers each 👏👏 have 👅 their own 😎🎡 droptables, containing good 👰👼 alchables and 👏⬆ other resources, making 👆👧 them consistent GP, which 👏👏 is ☝ auto-looted 🤖 in 👆 the 👏 Sophanem dungeon. ➕

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Soul 👻 Devourers are 👊🏃 located in 🕺🏽 the 😫🤔 Sophanem Slayer dungeon, 😈 shortcuts can be unlocked 🔓 to 😫 make 🙋♀ them 😣 easier 😁😀 to access, after navigating the dungeon 😈😈 once. 💯 The easiest way 👯👉 to 👂 get 😂👩 there 👌 would 👏👪 be a Sophanem Dungeon ⛓ Teleport tablet, craftable after 👀 reaching 👉 T4 reputation 〽 in 🌍 the ⏩😱 any Menaphos district. If the 🕘 player 🎮 has 🏼👌 completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little 👄😇 Helper quests, a 😰😱 quick 🏿🏿 way ↕➡ to 😘 access 🚪🚪 them would 💞 be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking ✋ the bridge to 🤷 Sophanem, and then 🅰😯 running south to 🗣 the 👦🍗 dungeon 😈 entrance.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Feathers of Ma'at** - required 📋📋 to 😉👐 kill 🔫 all 🤰😡 the mobs in 👏 the 🤷👏 Sophanem Slayer 💦 dungeon, ⛓😈 bar 🥃😫 the 💦 Magister.

.
⬥ **Sophanem Slayer Dungeon Drop Enhancers / Vital Spark Enhancers** - Purchaseable with dungeoneering tokens for 10,000 and 1000 dungeoneering tokens respectively, these offer increased drops in the dungeon. The dungeon drop enhancers increase the rate of keys obtained, and the vital spark enhancers provides +1 <:vitalspark:656426807893032963> on drop.

.
Most of the mobs in the slayer dungeon can be reasonably afk'd with a decent melee setup, through the usage of the Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> to provide healing. The action bar and preset above are recommended as a base preset, more food or slightly modified gear may be swapped between tasks.

.
**__Info__**
Feline Akhs have harder hitting attacks than Salawas, and have a special attack which deals large magic damage, and aggros nearby Feline Akhs. This occurs when the mob reaches 2500 HP, and hits when the bar above their head fully charges. Despite this, they can be very easily AFK'd in the same method as Salawas, and are often killed for their common elite clue drops. Due to their harder hitting attacks, the usage of a vampyrism scrimshaw is recommended to heal, as the player should be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>.

**__Info__**
Also 👨 afk'able with melee, due 👅👅 to 💦 their low 🏻👏 HP their 😍 dangerous 👎 special 👾 attack ⚔ can be 🌈 ignored. After 🅰 5 auto-attacks, 🤖🤖 they 🏻 strike the floor to deal a 🅱 large 3000 hit through deflect prayers. With 😲 a good 👌😩 setup, they 👨✨ can ☺🔫 also be ☃ AFK'd and ✊ provide strong XP rates, with 👏😲 active 👏 killing 🔪 allowing for 🎄🎅 competitive rates 😂💦 with 👏👏 other 🕹 tasks. 
⬥ Immediately at 105 <:slayer:797896049548066857>, the player can use a Wilder Pie to boost to kill these for improved XP rates.
⬥ If 👀🔎 the 🖇 player 💰 has the 👉🌌 level to 💦🔟 kill these, 🖼❌ they are 🙏 recommended to 👮 instead 👍 move 👊 on 👌 to the 🏼👏 Imperial Akhs via 💰💰 the 💦 usage of 💦 a 😯💰 Wilder Pie, which 👏 offer much stronger 💪💪 xp rates.

**__Stats__**
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> level : 117
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523>  XP per kill : 2500 + 825HP 
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 1780.6
⬥ Optimal kills ☠ per 👼👼 hour 😪💀 - 800
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~1.4m

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Differing to the other Akhs, these are best killed in the Player-Owned Slayer Dungeon, as the natural habitat provides bad opportunities for AoE, and contain the other two style Imperial Akhs. Both Melee and Magic are strong for these, Magic with an Inquisitor's staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> is the best method to kill these whilst AFK, whereas Melee is stronger if active. Magic can reach around 600kph, with Melee reaching 800+ at the higher end.

.
⬥ They use abilities and build adrenaline, starting with backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>, continuing with smash <:smash:535532879820619786> and slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, so standing still is important. 
    • If 👏 meleeing, anticipate is 😳 strongly 💪💪 recommended to 👏✌ be 🏿💦 used 🎶 often, 💰 and use 😂👏 the 🗣⛓ same 😂🤢 AoE setup as 💰 the 🔝⭐ other 😂👪 Akhs, ideally using 🤳 (Bladed dive + lacs) to 💦 constantly deal AoE damage. ☄☠ 
    • If maging, this is 👩 done ✅😤 through Legacy mode, so there ✔ is 😂🈶 no way to avoid 🙅🙅 stuns. 

.
⬥ Standing in the north of the room, and targeting the south standing Akhs is the best way to consistently AoE, and a higher levelled armour is recommended as they can hit quite hard. Vampyrism <:vamp:643505653079343144> is the recommended aura, followed by penance <:penance:643505653062565907> to remove the need for prayer restore. As the Inquisitor's staff is t80, Blood Burst can be used as the main spell due to it's scaling up to t79, and is significantly cheaper than Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>.
