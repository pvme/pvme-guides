> __**Camel Warriors**__

.tag:camel
__Stats__
○ :Combat:  XP per kill : 2186 + 721.3 HP
○ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 4768.8
○ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~760k XP/h

__Desirable drops__
○ For the slayer log, Camel Warriors drop their unique Camel Staff, a t85 staff that provides infinite fire runes. It is obtained at a rate of 1/2000 on task, and 1/10,000 off task.
○ Camel warriors have a poor drop table, with each kill worth x on average. With low kills per hour and poor drops, this makes it a task to avoid for gp

__Location and how to get there__
⬥ Their natural habitat is on an island just east of Sophanem, accessible via an agility shortcut in the desert outside Sophanem. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, then using the east wall shortcut to get outside.
⬥ Camel Warriors are best killed inside a Player-Owned Slayer Dungeon, with 3 in a large room being ideal.

__Useful items__
⬥ Whilst no special items are required to kill Camel Warriors, prayer restoring items like the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> can be used in conjunction with other methods of restoring prayer, due to the heavy prayer drain
.
__Method__
⬥ Camel warriors have one main mechanic, similar to that of Glacors. After taking some damage, they split into 3 mirages, Blood, Smoke and Shadow mirages. These have their own unique effects, and attack with magic attacks. Shadow mirages drain the player's prayer points after charging the bar above their heads, Blood mirages heal the other mirages for ~900 HP per attack, and Smoke mirages cast the Confuse, Weaken and Snare spells on the player, reducing hitchance and damage by 5%, and freezing you in place for 10s.
⬥ As mentioned above, killing them in the Player-Owned Slayer dungeon is the optimal way of killing Camel Warriors. Enter the large room with 100% adrenaline, and damage all 3 of the camel warriors to spawn their mirages. Exit the room, and wait for the mirages to stack up by the door, drop out of combat to losslessly <:devo:513190158728953857> and use <:zerk:535532854004678657><:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, enter the room and aoe the mirages down, using <:cane:535532878969438210> > <:bd:535532854281764884> > <:quake:535532879506309150> > <:cleave:535532878616985610>, then thresholds to finish off the respawned Camel Warriors. This is a good time to use <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> and build adrenaline for the next wave. Once the camel warriors respawn, repeat the same method. 
`Note:` Camel Warrior mirages do not count as targets for <:ruthless3:712244800572883025> or <:bd:535532854281764884>, so they do not refresh it's cooldown when killed, so the Mobile perk is recommended.

> **Acheron Mammoths**

.tag:mammoth
__Stats__
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 2508 + 827.6 HP 
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 4215.6
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~1.1m XP/h

__Desirable drops__
⬥ Acheron Mammoths have a guaranteed unique drop of their Mammoth Tusk, which is an ingredient in making Pack Mammoth <:Mammoth:513195712146702337> pouches. In addition to this, they have a rich drop table, with each kill worth roughly 50k, making the tasks decent for gp alongside xp. Mammoths also provide a large amount of crimson and blue charms, dropping 4 at a time.
.
__Location and how to get there__
⬥ Mammoths are located on the Mammoth Iceberg, accessible via a boat to the north of the Fremenik Lodestone.

__Useful items__
⬥ Magic notepaper - useful to note the tusks for extra gp.
⬥ Dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> - provide 20k extra damage every minute.
.
__Method__
⬥ Mammoths have 2 main special attacks, a charge, and a smite attack. The charge deals large melee damage, hits up to 3 times, and is indicated by the mammoth shaking and the blue bar above it's head fills up. To avoid this, simply pray <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and allow it to hit you, or move out of the way. The smite attack is caused by being outside of the mammoth's attack range when in combat with it, to deal with it stay melee distance as much as possible.
⬥ Mammoths attack with both melee and range hits, range hits have the animation of the mammoth throwing a large ice rock at the player's location, and can be avoided by moving out of the way. They can also sometimes throw 3 rocks at a time, so make sure to pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> or move. 
.
⬥ The best method to deal with Mammoths is to AoE as many of them as you can, using the Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> for the extended range. Stand in the area shown below, sip an aggression potion, pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and use AoEs such as <:cane:535532878969438210>, <:bd:535532854281764884>, <:quake:535532879506309150>, <:cleave:535532878616985610>, and <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> to deal large AoE damage. Remember to put dominion mines down every minute, and utilise <:zerk:535532854004678657><:zgs:626465964325601290><:spec:537340400273195028> to deal more damage. Use lossless healing food such as <:Brew:565726489400573962>/<:blueblubber:689530593742291033> to keep hp up, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>. Due to a low hitchance without a stab weapon, an accuracy boosting aura such as <:brawler:643505376917979138>/<:berserker:643505116347105290> should be used.
⬥ Melee is the best way to kill mammoths, however magic with the Inquisitor's staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> can also be viable. The strategy is less aoe-focused with magic, and make sure to stay in melee distance to avoid the smite attack. Try to use your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in an area where many mammoths can be reached, as to avoid getting smited.

> __**Living Wyverns**__

.tag:wyvern
__Stats:__
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 1859 + 613.4 HP
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 1878.8
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~1.1m XP/h

__Desirable drops__
⬥ Wyverns have a rich drop table, with each kill being worth x. They are the best source of Wyvern bones, an ingredient for super prayer potions.
⬥ For the slayer log, Wyverns are also killed for their unique drop, the Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:793936573351591977>. This is a powerful t85 crossbow, dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10,000 off-task.

__Location and how to get there__
⬥ Living Wyverns are located inside the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, accessed via a rope in the south of the Skeletal Wyvern room. The easiest way to get there would be via the Port Sarim lodestone and run south to the dungeon entrance, then take the agility shortcut directly east of the ladder. Alternatively, the fairy ring A.I.Q can be used to get to Mudskipper Point.
.
__Useful items__
⬥ To avoid the majority of the Wyvern's breath damage, a potion that blocks Wyrmbreath must be used, such as an overload salve variant <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> or a Wyrmfire potion.
⬥ Dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> - used to deal 2 large hits every minute, significantly lowering the hp of one Wyvern.
⬥ Bonecrusher - with the bonepicker upgrade from the Arc, this is extremely useful for picking up Wyvern bones, where they can be easily noted whilst continuing to kill Wyverns.
.
__Method__
⬥ The main mechanic to look out for when killing Wyverns is the frost % that builds up the more time you spend in the cave. Standing next to a lit fire reduces the frost quickly, but should only be done when required. The frost % has different effects depending on how cold the player is. When the player first enters, the Wyvern's poison damage will be large, hitting for up to 900 per hitsplat, however this is reduced to around 300 damage when the frost reaches 25%. After this, the Wyvern's auto-attack damage is increased up to 2500, and when the frost reaches 100% the player is frozen and stunned for 10 seconds. If this happens, the player should leave the cave, or use <:freedom:535541258240786434> and immediately stand next to a fire. It is optimal to keep frost above 25% and below 100, and spend as little time as possible next to a fire
.
⬥ Living Wyverns can hit quite hard with their range and magic auto-attacks, but in melee distance deal less damage. Wyverns are stunnable, so they can be stunned repeatedly to avoid taking damage at all. <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is used to regain lifepoints, and the Wyverns are fought in single combat. 
⬥ *Melee* - Melee is good at Wyverns, as being melee distance reduces the damage taken, and due to their low hp they can be killed extremely quickly when under the effects of <:zerk:535532854004678657>. Utilising movement abilities such as <:bd:535532854281764884>/<:gbarge:535532879250456578> should be prioritised, to hop quickly between the Wyverns. In the middle of the room there is a Wyvern spawn that is next to a fire, aim to attack that spawn when the frost is getting close to 100%. Due to their spread spawns, usage of the <:zgs:626465964325601290><:spec:537340400273195028> isn't recommended, however a <:mwspear:694566917456789554> can be utilised effectively to increase kph. Casting <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and <:dismember:535532879376023572> and moving on to another Wyvern is recommended if the hits are high, and if utilising <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, bled thresholds can be applied from a distance to high hp targets.
⬥ *Magic* - Magic is the best style at wyverns, due to their weakness to the Inquisitor's staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> . Stand close to a fire, and simply damage Wyverns within range. Wyverns are stunnable and bindable, so <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> + <:wrack:535533809823645697> can be a powerful combo. Blood spells help with healing, alongside Vampyrism aura if required. The fire directly to the west of the rope has a spawn that mines can be placed next to every minute for two 7k hits.
