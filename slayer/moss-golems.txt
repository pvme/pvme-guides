This makes Moss Golems worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ in uniques alone, paired with high kph, this makes them a very good gp task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Moss Golems are located in the south east clearing of the Lost Grove, accessible through the monolith west of the Incandescent wisp colony, west of Yanille. The easiest way to get there would be through the fairy ring (code **B J S**) after repairing it with 5 Bittercap mushrooms. An alternative method is to run west from the Incandescent wisp colony, accessible via the portal in the Max guild garden, or via the fairy ring south of Castle Wars (code **B K P**). Alternatively, players can also utilise the Solak <:solak:580167371310891029> boss portal through Max Guild, War's Retreat or the teleport through the grouping system.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Alloy Spikes** <:armourspike:756235792053174332> - Very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the cannon to restock without requiring interaction.

.
⬥ **Essence of Finality** <:eofor:745279787471470713> with an **Annihilation** <:annihilation:796989662983094275> stored inside - Provides a 1% damage boost for 30s per stack, capping at 20 stacks. A stack is gained on each successful hit, including armour spikes. Usage of the <:annihilation:796989662983094275> special attack is only recommended if the player is using both a Blood nihil familiar and the T99 prayer Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>, as your hit chance will drop too low without them and the special attack will clear itself upon splashing.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Moss Golems have hard hitting melee auto-attacks, and can hit from halberd range. When they lose HP, their heads pop off and spawn a Mossy Rock that also deals damage. To prevent taking too much damage, the Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> and Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perks are extremely important for survivability, as you will be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> regardless of which method you are using.

.
⬥ Moss Golems can be effectively afk'd with either a melee or magic setup, which will be detailed here. With the melee setup, Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability is a high priority here. For the most part the task can be done afk using the bar below, however make sure to keep an eye out and eat food if required. Moss golems have a high defence level, so usage of a Blood Nihil <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> is recommended. The Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> and Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> are the main sources of healing, with Alloy Spikes <:armourspike:756235792053174332> helping with the healing.
    • If using the Corbicula Rex perk from the Ranch out of Time, excess adrenaline can be used in the form of the <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> or <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, both of these can be rotated between to greatly increase the damage dealt. A Blood Nihil <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> is especially important if using <:annihilation:796989662983094275> spec, as it loses its effect and duration upon splashing.

.
⬥ Magic is used via Legacy mode.
    • One should stand on top of a hill near the entrance next to a pile of Moss Golem bodies to channel golems attacking the player onto 1 spot so they can be easily AOE'd.
    • If using the Inquisitor's Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>, the spell Blood Burst <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> can be used for a small damage reduction to save a large amount of blood runes, improving profits. Otherwise, Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> should be used.
    • 3 pieces of magic tank armour (helmet, legs, boots) should be used when maging in legacy to mitigate the damage taken with Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382>. If using Cryptbloom armour <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956>, only the helm and boots should be needed.
    • As you take significantly less damage with this method, the Penance Aura <:penance:643505653062565907> can be used for the task to be more AFK.

The player may also prefer to manually cast Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to be able to have more control and use it in a more strategic manner*

**__Where to Stand__**
.
For the respective methods, place the cannon on the red square, and stand on the yellow square shown in the image below. For the melee method, stand in a corner north east of the treeline on the map. For the magic method, the cannon is placed closer to the entrance as you will not have access to the Moss Golems further from the entrance. Placements is also shown in the low effort video example shown below.
