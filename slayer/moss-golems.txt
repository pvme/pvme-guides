⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~2.3m

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
Moss Golems drop two valuable items: Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> and the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> , both dropped at a rate of 1/1500 on task, and 1/5000 off task. This makes Moss Golems worth x in uniques alone, paired with high kph, this makes them a very good gp task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Moss Golems are located in 👏 the 👏🔝 south east 👉🌍 clearing of 👬💦 the 👏👏 Lost 💯 Grove, 😞😈 accessible through ➡🚪 the monolith west of the 🏻⏲ Incandescent wisp colony, west of ☝👩 Yanille. The 👏💰 easiest way to 💦🌅 get 🍌 there ✔ would 😏 be 😡🐝 through 🕳👉 the 💦 fairy ring 🔔 (code **B 🅾♂ J 🔥😎 S**) after 🏃👀 repairing it with 5 Bittercap mushrooms. An 😣💶 alternative method is 🤔💦 to 🔟👨 run 🏃🏃 west from 😂 the 🏳👏 Incandescent wisp colony, accessible via the portal in 👉👏 the 👨 Max guild garden, or via 💰💰 the 😂 fairy ring 💍💍 south 👇👇 of Castle Wars (code **B 💪 K 🙅🔫 P**). ✏✏

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Alloy Spikes** <:armourspike:756235792053174332> - Very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** 👉👉 - Allows the 🏡 cannon to 👉🅱 restock without 🚱🚫 requiring interaction 🗣🗣

.
⬥ **Essence of Finality** <:eofor:745279787471470713> with an **Annihilation** <:annihilation:796989662983094275> stored inside - Provides a 1% damage boost for 30s per stack, capping at 20 stacks. A stack is gained on each successful hit, including armour spikes. Usage of the <:annihilation:796989662983094275> special attack is only recommended if the player is using both a Blood nihil familiar and the T99 prayer Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>, as your hit chance will drop too low without them and the special attack will clear itself upon splashing.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Moss Golems have 🍆👨 hard 🔩 hitting 😦😦 melee auto-attacks, 🤖🤖 and 📎 can 🔫😡 hit from 😂 halberd range. 💦 When they lose 🚫😱 HP, their heads 🙈 pop 🍾 off 🙌☕ and ➕ spawn a Mossy Rock 🍙 that 😐👨 also 👨🅱 deals damage. ☠☄

.
⬥ Moss Golems can be effectively afk'd with the correct setup, which will be detailed here. The Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability is a high priority here, alongside the enhanced devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> and devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perks, which provide a huge melee damage reduction, as you will be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>. For the most part the task can be done afk using the bar below, however make sure to keep an eye out and eat food if required. Moss golems have a high defence level, so usage of a blood nihil is recommended. The Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> and Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> are the main sources of healing, with Alloy Spikes <:armourspike:756235792053174332> helping with the healing. 
    • If using the Corbicula Rex perk from the Ranch out of Time, excess adrenaline can be used in the form of the <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> or <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, both of these can be rotated between to greatly increase the damage dealt. A Blood nihil is especially important if using <:annihilation:796989662983094275> spec, as it loses its effect and duration upon splashing.

*Note: It is assumed certain abilities such as Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, EoF special attack <:eofspec:746403211908481184> and weapon special attack <:spec:537340400273195028> are accessible on other action bars, or through ability books, for manual use. The player may also prefer to manually cast Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to be able to have more control and use it in a more strategic manner*
