⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 2408.8

**__Desirable Drops__**
Moss Golems drop three valuable items:
Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> Drop Rate of 1/1500 on task and 1/5000 off task
Ancient Elven Ritual Shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> Drop Rate of 1/1500 on task and 1/5000 off task
Torn Grimoire Pages <:grimpage:643168594493964298> Drop Rate of 1/512 on task and 1/1,536 off task. 

This makes Moss Golems worth $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ in uniques alone, paired with high kph, this makes them a very good gp task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Moss Golems are located in the south east clearing of the Lost Grove, accessible through the monolith west of the Incandescent wisp colony, west of Yanille. The easiest way to get there would be through the fairy ring (code **B J S**) after repairing it with 5 Bittercap mushrooms. An alternative method is to run west from the Incandescent wisp colony, accessible via the portal in the Max guild garden, or via the fairy ring south of Castle Wars (code **B K P**).

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Alloy Spikes** <:armourspike:756235792053174332> - Very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the cannon to restock without requiring interaction

.
⬥ **Essence of Finality** <:eofor:745279787471470713> with an **Annihilation** <:annihilation:796989662983094275> stored inside - Provides a 1% damage boost for 30s per stack, capping at 20 stacks. A stack is gained on each successful hit, including armour spikes. Usage of the <:annihilation:796989662983094275> special attack is only recommended if the player is using both a Blood nihil familiar and the T99 prayer Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>, as your hit chance will drop too low without them and the special attack will clear itself upon splashing.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Moss Golems have hard hitting melee auto-attacks, and can hit from halberd range. When they lose HP, their heads pop off and spawn a Mossy Rock that also deals damage.

.
⬥ Moss Golems can be effectively afk'd with the correct setup, which will be detailed here. The Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability is a high priority here, alongside the enhanced devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> and devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perks, which provide a huge melee damage reduction, as you will be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>. For the most part the task can be done afk using the bar below, however make sure to keep an eye out and eat food if required. Moss golems have a high defence level, so usage of a blood nihil is recommended. The Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> and Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> are the main sources of healing, with Alloy Spikes <:armourspike:756235792053174332> helping with the healing.
    • If using the Corbicula Rex perk from the Ranch out of Time, excess adrenaline can be used in the form of the <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> or <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, both of these can be rotated between to greatly increase the damage dealt. A Blood nihil is especially important if using <:annihilation:796989662983094275> spec, as it loses its effect and duration upon splashing.

*Note: It is assumed certain abilities such as Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, EoF special attack <:eofspec:746403211908481184> and weapon special attack <:spec:537340400273195028> are accessible on other action bars, or through ability books, for manual use. The player may also prefer to manually cast Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to be able to have more control and use it in a more strategic manner*
