> **Soul Devourers**

⬥ There are 6 Soul Devourer types, between slayer levels 105 to 117, alongside the ability to kill the Magister at 115 Slayer. Each mob offers a different level of AFK-ability and GP rates, so the choice of which to kill is up to the player. The types that are recommended to kill will be listed below.

__Desirable drops__
⬥ Soul Devourers are one of the three sources that drop the Key to the Crossing , and Vital Sparks <:vitalspark:656426807893032963>, adding a lot of value to each task. Keys are dropped at a rate of 1/75 on task, which can be increased to 1/60 with the usage of Sophanem Slayer dungeon drop enhancers. Vital sparks are uncommon drops, and can be doubled via the use of Vital Spark enhancers, which can be purchased with dungeoneering tokens alongside the key enhancers.
⬥ In addition to this, Soul Devourers each have their own droptables, containing good alchables and other resources, making them consistent GP, which is auto-looted in the Sophanem dungeon.

__Location and how to get there__
⬥ Soul Devourers are located in the Sophanem Slayer dungeon, shortcuts can be unlocked to make them easier to access, after navigating the dungeon once. The easiest way to get there would be a Sophanem Dungeon Teleport tablet, craftable after reaching T4 reputation in the any Menaphos district. If the player has completed the Contact!, Jack of Trades and Icthlarin's Little Helper quests, a quick way to access them would be via the Menaphos lodestone, taking the bridge to Sophanem, and then running south to the dungeon entrance.

__Useful items__
⬥ Feathers of Ma'at are required to kill all the mobs in the Sophanem Slayer dungeon, bar the Magister
⬥ Sophanem Slayer Dungeon drop enhancers + Vital spark enhancers - Purchaseable with dungeoneering tokens for 10,000 and 1000 dungeoneering tokens respectively, these offer increased drops in the dungeon. The dungeon drop enhancers increase the rate of keys obtained, and the vital spark enhancers provides +1 vital sparks on drop.

__General Method__
Melee afk bar-
Melee preset
⬥ Most of the mobs in the slayer dungeon can be reasonably afk'd with a decent melee setup, through the usage of the Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> to provide healing. The action bar and preset above are recommended as a base preset, more food or slightly modified gear may be swapped between tasks.

> Salawa Akh

__Stats__
⬥ Slayer level : 105
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 622.4 + 205.3HP
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 504
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~504k

__Info__
⬥ The lowest level Soul Devourers, these hit weakly with melee attacks and have no special attacks, making them easy to AFK. The usage of a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism is recommended, however due to their weak attacks, can be killed with <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> active.

> Feline Akh

__Stats__
⬥ Slayer level : 107
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 588.6 + 194.2HP
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 536.2
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~536k

__Info__
⬥ Feline Akhs have harder hitting attacks than Salawas, and have a special attack which deals large magic damage, and aggros nearby Feline Akhs. This occurs when the mob reaches 2500 HP, and hits when the bar above their head fully charges. Despite this, they can be very easily AFK'd in the same method as Salawas, and are often killed for their common elite clue drops. Due to their harder hitting attacks, the usage of a vampyrism scrimshaw is recommended to heal, as the player should be praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>.

> Scarab Akh

__Stats:__
⬥ Slayer level : 109
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 809 + 266.9
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 714.8
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~ 714k

__Info__
⬥ Scarab Akhs have higher HP, but offer much better xp rates than the previous Akhs. Their special attack is the chance to apply Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> to the player, increasing the damage taken by 10%. This can be reasonably ignored, using the same setup as Feline ahks, praying <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and using <:devo:513190158728953857> when required.

> Crocodile Akh

__Stats:__
⬥ Slayer level : 111
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 840 + 277HP
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 761
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~837k

__Info__
⬥ Also afk'able with melee, due to their low HP their dangerous special attack can be ignored. After 5 auto-attacks, they strike the floor to deal a large 3000 hit through deflect prayers. With a good setup, they can also be AFK'd and provide strong xp rates, with active killing allowing for competitive rates with other tasks. If the player has the level to kill these, they are recommended to instead move on to the Imperial Akhs via the usage of a Wilder Pie, which offer much stronger xp rates.

> Imperial Warrior Akh

__Stats:__
⬥ Slayer level : 117
⬥ :Combat:  XP per kill : 2500 + 825HP 
⬥ :Slayer:  XP per kill : 1780.6
⬥ Optimal :Slayer: XP per hour : ~1050k

> **Method**
⬥ Differing to the other Akhs, these are best killed in the Player-Owned Slayer Dungeon, as the natural habitat provides bad opportunities for AoE, and contain the other two style Imperial Akhs. Both Melee and Magic are strong for these, Magic with an Inquisitor's staff is the best method to kill these whilst AFK, whereas Melee is stronger if active. Magic can reach around 600kph, with Melee reaching 800+ at the higher end.
⬥ They use abilities and build adrenaline, starting with backhand, continuing with smash and slaughter, so standing still is important. If meleeing, anticipate is strongly recommended to be used often, and use the same AoE setup as the other Akhs, ideally using (Bladed dive + lacs) to constantly deal AoE damage. If maging, this is done through Legacy mode, so there is no way to avoid stuns. Standing in the north of the room, and targeting the south standing Akhs is the best way to consistently AoE, and a higher levelled armour is recommended as they can hit quite hard. Vampyrism is the recommended aura, followed by penance to remove the need for prayer restore. As the Inquisitor's staff is t80, Blood Burst can be used as the main spell due to it's scaling up to t79, and is significantly cheaper than blood barrage.
