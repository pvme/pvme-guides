.
**__Desirable Drops__**
Due 👅 to 💰 the 👏 nature 🏔🌿 of the 🌜🦃 Scrimshaw of Sacrifice, all 🥜🤷 tradeable drops ⬇😲 are 🍑 destroyed. 🏚 These 💦 are ⭐🏻 elite dungeon 😈 mobs, and ➕ untradeable drops 😲 are 💯😍 not 🚫❌ destroyed 🏚 by the 🐫👌 scrimshaw, therefore 🔥 they 👸😅 still 😋 drop 🚮🔚 Laboratory Relics and 🍷 Perfect 👌 Gemstone Scales.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Two dragons are located in a 💰 large 🏔 clearing shortly before 🔙 the 💊⬇ Black 🏿🏴 Stone Dragon 🐉🐲 encounter inside the Dragonkin 🐉 Laboratory Elite 👏👏 Dungeon. The closest method of teleporting is via the usage of the 👩 elite 🏻🏻 dungeon chest, ⚰ teleporting to option 4 ✌😘 (**Kalist Kiket Fia**) and 🏿 running north ☝💈 to 🆒👉 get 🏼 to the dragons.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Scrimshaw of 💦👏 Sacrifice** - Provides 50% 👌 extra Slayer 💦 experience at the cost 💰💵 of tradeable drops. ⬇💦 Extremely 💛 useful here 🚨💦 as relics are 👧♀ kept, and the 👏 tradeable drops 😲💦 are 😻 worth 💰💵 very little.

.
⬥ **Dragon 🐲 Slayer Gloves** - Provides a 15% Slayer experience 💰😋 boost and 10% 💯 accuracy boost when 🍑🍑 slaying dragons. Purchaseable with 100 💯 thaler or 👉 200 Fist of 💦🐲 Guthix 💚 tokens, and ➕💃 last 🕖 for 👏 1000 kills. ☠

.
⬥ **Dominion Mines** <:dommine:662249620579155968> - Deployable twice per minute, deals up to 10k damage on a target below 138 combat level.

.
⬥ **Acceleration Potions** - Reduces the cooldown of mobility abilities such as Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> to 0.6s, allowing for extremely quick travel over large distances.

.
⬥ **Dragonbane Weaponry** - T79 Melee weapons, provide a 25% 👏👏 damage ☄ increase 💳 against Dragon class ⚠🤓 mobs. This 😍😞 only 😂🕦 affects the ⚕👏 mainhand and 2h variants, so a normal 🖖 offhand should 🤔 be 🎮 used 🆒 if meleeing.

.
**__General Strategy__**
⬥ There 😍😍 are 🙏🏼 two Hydrix dragons inside ED2, each 👋👋 with 70,000 LP. These 💦 are ☝ not 🚫🤚 door mobs, as 🕛 such, 😲😁 they respawn upon 😂🙀 leaving 🏃 and 👏 re-entering 💁 the 💬 dungeon, as 🖕🏿 long 😩 as the 👏 next set 📚 of door 🙌🚙 mobs aren't killed. ☠❌ To set ⚔ up ⬆ the ⛓ dungeon for 😙 slayer 💦💦 purposes, the 🚮💞 two doors 🚪 after defeating Verak Lith must 💰 be 🐝💰 opened, but 🤔 do 💕🤤 not open 🌊 the 👏👩 two doors 🚪 before the 💰 Black Stone 🗿 Dragon, 🐲 as 🍑 this 👆😰 will 👊 prevent 🚫🚫 the dragons from 😂💰 respawning. 

.
⬥ To start, the Adrenaline Crystal at War's Retreat can be used to build up to 100% adrenaline. Use the boss portal to teleport to the Dragonkin Laboratory, enter and use the chest to teleport to option 4. Bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> are all helpful for navigating the dungeon, running north to get to the dragons. 
    • Acceleration potions are extremely ☣ useful here ‼ for 👏 faster 🔥🚀 runs. 💰💰 

.
⬥ Place Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968>, and use an ultimate ability Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>/ Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>/ Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, alongside AoE's to kill the dragons quickly. The Dragon Slayer <:dragonslayer:641339921814126594> ability is worth using here, providing a 15% damage boost for 10 seconds, and can be used every run. Once killed, teleport out, refill on adrenaline and repeat the process.

.
*Note: Whilst any style can be used here, both Ranged and Melee outshine Magic, and are recommended for faster XP/h. The presets below show best-in-slot gear, but this is not required to kill them by any means, downgrade items to fit your setup.*

.
**__Ranged Method__**
Attempt to lure the two dragons together by casting Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, running further south, then moving back to target the northern-most dragon.

.
**__Melee Method__**
⬥ Usage of 😝 the Dragon 🐲 slayer gloves is 😘 highly recommended, as they ♂❤ have a low ⬇👇 affinity to melee.

.
⬥ When using bane weaponry, an aura such as Berserker/Brawler should be utilised to reach 100% hitchance, it can be checked via the calculator in <#611748860746006528>.
