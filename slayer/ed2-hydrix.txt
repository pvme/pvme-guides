> __**ED2 Hydrix Dragons**__

**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523>  XP per kill : 17,134 + 5654 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 17,000 (29,325 with Scrimshaw of Sacrifice + Dragon Slayer gloves)
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: 120
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~3.5m

**__Desirable drops__**
⬥ Due to the nature of the Scrimshaw of Sacrifice, all tradeable drops are destroyed. These are elite dungeon mobs, and untradeable drops are not destroyed by the scrimshaw, therefore they still drop Laboratory Relics and Perfect Gemstone Scales.

**__Location and how to get there__**
⬥ Two dragons are located in a large clearing shortly before the Black Stone Dragon encounter inside the Dragonkin Laboratory Elite Dungeon. The closest method of teleporting is via the usage of the elite dungeon chest, teleporting to option 4 (Kalist Kiket Fia) and running north to get to the dragons.

.
**__Useful items__**
⬥ Scrimshaw of Sacrifice - Provides 50% extra Slayer experience at the cost of tradeable drops. Extremely useful here as relics are kept, and the tradeable drops are worth very little.
⬥ Dragon Slayer Gloves - Provides a 15% Slayer experience boost and 10% accuracy boost when slaying dragons. Purchaseable with 100 thaler or 200 Fist of Guthix tokens, and last for 1000 kills.
⬥ Dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> - Deployable twice per minute, deals up to 10k damage on a target below 138 combat level.
⬥ Acceleration potions - Reduces the cooldown of mobility abilities such as Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> to 0.6s, allowing for extremely quick travel over large distances.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ There are two Hydrix dragons inside ED2, each with 70,000 LP. These are not door mobs, as such, they respawn upon leaving and re-entering the dungeon, as long as the next set of door mobs aren't killed. To set up the dungeon for slayer purposes, the two doors after defeating Verak Lith must be opened, but do not open the two doors before the Black Stone Dragon, as this will prevent the dragons from respawning. 

⬥ To start, the Adrenaline Crystal at War's Retreat can be used to build up to 100% adrenaline. Use the boss portal to teleport to the Dragonkin Laboratory, enter and use the chest to teleport to option 4. Bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> are all helpful for navigating the dungeon, running north to get to the dragons. 
    • Acceleration potions are extremely useful here for faster runs. 

⬥ Attempt to lure the two dragons together by casting <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, running further south, then moving back to target the northern-most dragon. Place <:dommine:662249620579155968>, and use an ultimate ability <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>/<:Berserk:513190158468907012>/<:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, alongside AoE's to kill the dragons quickly. The <:dragonslayer:641339921814126594> ability is worth using here, providing a 15% damage boost for 10 seconds, and can be used every run. Once killed, teleport out, refill on adrenaline and repeat the process.

*Note: Whilst any style can be used here, both Ranged and Melee outshine Magic, and are recommended for faster XP/h. The presets below show best-in-slot gear, but this is not required to kill them by any means, downgrade items to fit your setup.*
