**__Assumptions__**
⬥ In 👇👇 the 👧 pictures 🚺 above, the optimal block and prefer 😘🏻 lists for 👊🙌 XP and GP focused 😤 slayer 🍆 is 🕰❓ shown. These 💈💁 are based off 💦 the 👏 weightings of each task, 🚜 the blocked tasks are 🏻💰 highly 💨🔊 weighted and 😫👏 offer low rates 💰💰 in either 😬😤 XP, GP or 🤔 both. Some 🎊👳 high-weight ☝⌨ but 🍑☹ fast tasks were 😍 excluded from 👉 the 🌎 block 🍆 list, 📜📝 as 😖😎 those are used to 💦 build points, 🎉 such 😳😲 as 🍑😏 Dagannoths or Order of 👏🍳 Ascension Members.

.
⬥ The 🅱 XP-focused tasks have a 😄👏 few 🔢🔛 assumptions, that 🏻 Ripper Demons are 👏 killed ❌ for ⌛😙 all 😱 Demon 👹 tasks, ED2 Hydrix dragons are killed 🗡❌ for 👨 both Gemstone Dragons and 🤜 Dragon 🐲 tasks, Moss Golems are killed 😵🔫 for 😏 Creatures 🐶 of 😂💦 the 🔝 Lost Grove, and 👏 that 🏻 the player's highest 🤑🤠 level 🔥🆙 Soul Devourer is 👏😳 killed. ☠🔫 
    • If 🎵👏 required ✅✅ to, 😂💯 the player 👨 should 😤💦 boost with the 👏 use 👏👏 of 🍒 a Wilder Pie 💦🤤 to 💦🙅 kill higher 🔝 levelled mobs, to boost their XP rates 📉😂 further. 🤔🤔

.
⬥ The GP focused 😵 tasks assume 🤷🏽 that 👣😳 the 👏😭 player is 🈶 using Binding 🤝🤝 Contracts for 🎅🤔 both 🌜 Ripper Demon 👹 and 🍼 Demon 👺 tasks. Tasks that 🔇 are 💁🙏 not 🙅 preferred 📦📦 but 🅱🤔 are often good to 💦🗣 do 😍 include 😠😠 Crystal Shapeshifters, Iorwerth Elves, 💁♀ Nihils and ☠💰 Tormented Demons, with 😣 the latter two being ⛪😑 required ✅ to 🎯 be unlocked. 🔓🔓

.
⬥ Laniakea's special 👾 assignment is 💦🤔 a 💍 very 👿🙌 strong 💪😍 task, granting 50k slayer 💦💦 XP and 45 slayer 🍆 points upon 😽👤 completion, and 👏👈 only ☝ requires 1 👨💸 kill 🔫 of 🔥 each 👏👏 Vile 🤢 Bloom. This takes 💜💜 a few 🔛😋 minutes 😳 and 🔟 gives 😚 large 🏔 rewards, 🎁 so 👟 should 👫 always 🕔🤔 be completed. On 🔛👋 the 💰☀ other 💃 hand, 🏿 Morvran's special assignment requires many boss 👨 kills, ‼ takes 💜💜 too much time 🕗 and gives 😚 very 👌🍀 little 👌 reward, so 🤔😊 should 💘🈶 be 😡🅱 turned off 🙌💰 for 🍆🍆 free, 🏇🤔 after 👀❌ being 🌪😑 completed once ☝ for 👻🎅 the 💤 completionist cape requirement.

**__How to Use These Lists__**
⬥ In 🔙👏 order 📑 for 🍆👷 the 🎁➕ player to ➡💱 profit or 🅱 break-even 💔🔨 on slayer 🍆 points on average, 💰 their ☝ prefer 🏻 list weighting must 🙋 equal ⬆ 19.2% of 💰 the total 💯 task 🐴🚜 weighting, as 🕘🍑 long as Slayer 🍆 VIP tickets are 💯 used. Slayer 💦🍆 tasks completed with 👏😉 Laniakea award 35.2 slayer 🍆💦 points 😘📝 on 💰 average, and 💰 as a skip costs 30 ✈✈ points, 📝❤ the player must complete 🚫 46% of 🙏💦 their 🍆🍆 tasks on 🌞🅱 average 💰➗ to profit slayer points, so 🥛 don't 😡🚫 be 🐝 too 🚬😎 afraid 😨😨 to skip tasks. 
    • If 🚀 the 😎☺ player is 🈶 120 Slayer, 🍆🍆 the 👏 cape perk ⏫⏫ allows them 👹 to 💦 skip even 👩🤤 more 💴 tasks, as they 👨🙅 have 🈶✅ a ✋😘 guaranteed 🔖 task 🚜 they will complete when 😩🕕 they choose it, 👱💯 20% 🔳🎉 of the 🅱 time. 🕐

.
⬥ Bad tasks should always 👉⌛ be 👏 blocked or 🍆💦 skipped with 👏😂 quick 🛀🍆 tasks completed to 🈶💦 upkeep slayer 🍆 points, 📝 and never ❌🙅 reset your streak 🔥🔥 via 💰 a 🙃 Spria task, as the streak bonus is 💦👉 very important to 💦 gaining 🏋 slayer 🍆💦 points 👌 consistently. Due to 👂💦 the 🎅 nature 🌴🌴 of 🔝 some tasks, slayer 🍆 points 😘👄 can 👀 be quite ✡ valuable.

.
⬥ Whilst these 💈 lists 📇 are 🏃👆 optimal, many 💯 players 📱 will 💰👻 find 🔎 that 😐🏻 they 🙅👥 enjoy or 🅱 dislike 🖤 tasks, which 🐱 is 👏 perfectly 🍑🍑 fine. 👌 Take into 👉🍐 account 💳💳 which tasks you 👈🗣 personally prefer, 👍👍 and 💰🗣 build 👷🏻 your lists 📇 around that. **The most important ❌✅ thing is 💦🍆 to 🅱✌ enjoy 😘💋 slaying!**
