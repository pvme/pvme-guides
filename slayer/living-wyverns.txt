__**Living Wyverns**__
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

.
> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Wyverns are one of the 4 raptor mobs, and are known for their unique environmental effects and highly damaging attacks. They offer decent <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP, and are a consistent source of GP due to their wyvern bone drops.

⬥ The Dragon slayer perk and sigil <:dragonslayerperk:689502927731163170> <:dragonslayer:641339921814126594>, along with any other dragon-slaying related items such as <:jasdragonbanearrow:971025697042755584>, do **NOT** work on wyverns.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill : 1859 + 613.4 <:constitution:689509250887712902>
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per kill : 1878.8
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: ~760 (~530 AFK)
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~1.4M (~995K AFK)

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
.tag:drops
⬥ Wyverns have a rich drop table, with each kill being worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D41$. They are the best source of Wyvern bones, an ingredient for super prayer potions.

.
⬥ For the slayer log, Wyverns are also killed for their unique drop, the Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>, a T85 crossbow dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10,000 off-task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
.tag:location
Living Wyverns are found in 2 locations:
1. The Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, accessed via a rope in the south of the Skeletal Wyvern room.
    a. The easiest way to get there would be via dungeoneering cape teleport <:dgcape:976732922545586246> to the Frost dragon dungeon (0,8)
2. **Northwest of Ghorrock, accessed via the Ghorrock teleport (ancient spellbook)**
    a. This is the best location as it benefits from the <:infernalpuzzlebox:994189299681607800> and <:jasboost:1006121672790773770>
    b. Wyverns are also attackable from areas without the chill mechanic, making it viable to be stationary and AFK in this location.

> **__Method: Active/AFK Magic__**
.tag:magic
Magic is the best style at wyverns by far, due to their weakness to the <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> and <:animatedead:856635090453135382> damage reduction.

⬥ Wyverns are stunnable and bindable, so <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> + <:wrack:856662355952795658> can be a powerful combo if using 4TAA. Blood spells help with healing, alongside <:vampaura:643505653079343144> if required.

**__Active Strategy__**
⬥ If doing them actively with best-in-slot gear, stand close to the most north-western fire in the wilderness spot (refer to example vod), and use target cycle to target wyverns within range. Use <:dommine:662249620579155968> whenever <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is used along with <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> if available.

⬥ Use <:gchain:787904334495088672> combos opportunistically on any wyverns that wander close to each other.

⬥ When eating solid food, such as sharks dropped by wyverns, try to eat them in the tick between the end of a kill and the start of the next kill when you have no target, as this does not reduce adrenaline.

⬥ If doing wyverns with lesser gear, an <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> may be used to aggro a limited amount (2-3) of wyverns which makes it more manageable to <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>, as shown below:

.
**__AFK Strategy__**
⬥ If AFKing, stand south of the area out of range of the cavern chill effect.
    • If positioned correctly, the chill status icon should not be seen on the debuff bar.

⬥ Set your legendary pet to scavenge for **noted items** along with **runes and talismans**.
    • Besides noted items and salvage, soul runes <:soulrune:536252660333019136> are also valuable common loot.

⬥ One possibility for positioning is as follows (may not be optimal):

**__Revo bar__**
This bar should be used only for AFKing.

***Note:** Take out <:tuskas:513201065513058306> if AFKing off-task.*
