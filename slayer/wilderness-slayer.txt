__**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
The Wilderness (or *Wildy*), is a dangerous wasteland in north-east Gielinor. It is home to various slayer monsters and a few bosses. This channel will be focused towards guides and strategies concerning the content in the wilderness, namely after the Wilderness Reborn update.


*Disclaimer:* this channel will **NOT** cover PvP-related content. All guides assume the player has opted out of PvP, in order to bring better gear without risking losing it permanently.

.
__**Wilderness Map and Mechanics**__
.tag:map
.
Following the Wilderness Reborn update, various slayer monster spawns have been added and changed.

A threat system has been added, which increases by Spending time in the wilderness (1 threat level per 10 minutes), killing monsters in the wilderness or gathering resources using wilderness nodes, up to a maximum of level 10. As the threat level increases, the player takes and deals more damage (1% per threat level, up to a maximum of 10%).

Additionally, the Wilderness will become more aggressive towards the player has the threat level increases, both by its volcano throwing ranged or magic hard "typeless" hits towards the player, and by spawning flash mobs to ambush the player. Higher threat level increases the amount of slayer points awarded by Mandrith, which will be discussed further in this channel.

Shown below is the Wilderness Map with the new monsters' locations, following the update:

__**Mandrith (Wilderness Slayer + Chests)**__
.tag:mandrith
.
Mandrith is a Slayer Master in deep Wilderness, requiring level 95 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> and a Combat Level of 120 <:combat:797896050370281523> to use. All his tasks are for monsters that are in the Wilderness, and can only be completed in the Wilderness. Unlike other Slayer Masters, Mandrith assigns tasks irrespective of whether the player has blocked or preferred them.

A task from Mandrith awards 15 Slayer points plus the player's Threat level at time of completion. Completing Mandrith's Slayer tasks will award a Wilderness Slayer Chest. If the task is completed without dying or skipping it, 1 Reaper Point <:Reaperpoints:704657943194501140> is also awarded.

.
__**AFK Hydrix Dragons**__
.tag:hydrix
⬥ Up to 250 KPH
.img:https://i.imgur.com/jZxxxlE.png

.
> **__Introduction__**
Hydrix dragons is relevant to players desiring slayer log completion and exp. They provide more than twice the slayer XP per kill of Onyx dragons and are considered one of the higest XP/hr tasks in the game.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> level: 101
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill: 4585.4 + 1513.1 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per kill: 4768.8
⬥ Optimal kills per hour - 250
⬥ Optimal kills <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP hour - 1.2M (1.8M with Scrimshaw of Sacrifice)

.
**__Location in the Wilderness__**
⬥ They are located in the Wilderness Dungeon just south of Mandrith and the Pirates' Hideout.
    • The quickest way to get there is by teleporting to Mandrith using the Slayer Cape <:slayercape:975284344123953164>, walk south and down the ladder.

.
**__Useful Items__**
.
⬥ **Scrimshaw of Sacrifice**  - As dragons do not have many valuable drops, this can be used for 50% increased slayer and combat exp, which works well on these monsters with already high base slayer exp.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> to restock without user input.

.
⬥ **Death Ward** <:deathward:697808774068699286> - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%
    • This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement.

.
> **__Method__**

Hydrix Dragons retain their special attack in the Wilderness, which fires out gemstone spikes that drain adrenaline to 0 and halves adrenaline gain for 15 seconds. This can be avoided by safespotting a single spawn, but killing 2 spawns as shown below provides higher KPH despite their special attack.

Players should place the Oldak Coil (red square) and themselves (yellow square) as shown below:

> __**AFK Ripper Demons**__
.tag:ripper
⬥ Up to 1100 KPH
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Y3fqMZr.png

.
> **__Introduction__**
Ripper Demons are one of the 4 Raptor Mobs, and provide both the highest experience and GP rates in the group.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill : 2159.5 + 712.6 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per kill : 2721.5
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: 1100
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~3m

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Ripper Demons have a valuable loot table containing: Wines of Zamorak, Rune salvage, coins and a variety of high level herbs.
    • This makes them one of the better tasks to do for gp.

⬥ When killed with Binding Contracts in your inventory, they are captured and turned into a Binding Contract (Ripper Demon) <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>
    • This provides a large buff to the GP/h of Ripper Demons, currently adding an extra <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ per kill.

.
⬥ For the Slayer log, Ripper Demons also drop:
    • Mainhand and offhand Ripper Claws <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444>
    • Cursed Amascut Sand
    • The 5 Miner's journals
    • The Parasitic orb
        - A pet item that unlocks the Nipper Demon pet
        - Dropped at a rate of 1/30,000 from Ripper Demons and 1/333 from Elite Ripper Demons

.
**__Location in the Wilderness__**
⬥ They are located between the Red Dragon Isle and the Demonic Ruins, south of the Chaos Elemental.
    • The quickest ways to get there are via the Wilderness Obelisks (teleporting to level 50 wilderness and then walking south-west) or via the Wilderness Sword Herb Patch teleport, then walking north-east.)

.
**__Useful Items__**
.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the <:cannon:869283142350041098> to restock without user input.

.
⬥ **Death Ward** <:deathward:697808774068699286> - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%
    • This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement.

.
> **__Method__**

In the Wilderness, Ripper Demons do **NOT** use their instakill Special Attack if not targeted first. However, they still teleport next to the player and spin after being killed, dealing rapid melee hits in a 3x3 area.

As such, this method is based on killing them with Legacy Blood Barrage/Burst, while using a Dwarven Siege Engine to aggro as many Ripper Demons without provoking their special attack.

Players should place the cannon and themselves as shown below, using Legacy <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> (<:soa:869284271595069451>) or Legacy <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> (<:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>).

Using Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is mandatory, to negate their rapid melee hits when killed.

Players should place the Dwarven Siege Engine (red square) and themselves (yellow square) as shown below:

    • Wyrm Heart, worth $data_pvme:Slayer!C99$ <:coins:698816156961603654>

        - Dropped at a rate of 1/6168 on task (1/12,288 off task) from Lava Strykewyrms or 1/1,536 from WildyWyrms.

⬥ **Death Note** - automatically notes dropped bones and ashes. May be used if the player hasn't yet completed the Elite Wilderness Achievements.

.
> **__Method__**

After the Wilderness Update, killing Lava Strykewyrms has become substantially safer. Despite that, their drops are still highly valued because the uniques are quite rare and the Searing Ashes are in high demand as they are the main ingredient for Aggresion Potions.

This method is can be done with low effort, only requiring the player to click on each spawn and letting Revo++ kill them (~250 KPH), or with high effort, using both dual-wield and 2H weapons and full manual (~300 KPH).

.
> **__Method__**

After the Wilderness Update, killing Revenants has become substantially safer, as player's can now opt-out of PvP. Despite that, some of their drops are still highly valued because of their rarity.

This method consists in killing them with Legacy combat, 1 by 1. Although it is low effort, it's not AFK due to their distance between spawn locations and long respawn time.
