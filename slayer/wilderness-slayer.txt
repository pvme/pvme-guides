### Introduction
.tag:intro
The Wilderness (or *Wildy*), is a dangerous wasteland in north-east Gielinor. It is home to various slayer monsters and a few bosses. This channel will be focused towards guides and strategies concerning the content in the wilderness, namely after the Wilderness Reborn update.


*Disclaimer:* this channel will **NOT** cover PvP-related content. All guides assume the player has opted out of PvP, in order to bring better gear without risking losing it permanently.

### Wilderness Map and Mechanics
.tag:map
.
Following the Wilderness Reborn update, various slayer monster spawns have been added and changed.

A threat system has been added, which increases by Spending time in the wilderness (1 threat level per 10 minutes), killing monsters in the wilderness or gathering resources using wilderness nodes, up to a maximum of level 10. As the threat level increases, the player takes and deals more damage (1% per threat level, up to a maximum of 10%).

Additionally, the Wilderness will become more aggressive towards the player has the threat level increases, both by its volcano throwing ranged or magic hard "typeless" hits towards the player, and by spawning flash mobs to ambush the player. Higher threat level increases the amount of slayer points awarded by Mandrith, which will be discussed further in this channel.

Shown below is the Wilderness Map with the new monsters' locations, following the update:

### Mandrith (Wilderness Slayer + Chests)
.tag:mandrith
.
Mandrith is a Slayer Master in deep Wilderness, requiring level 95 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> and a Combat Level of 120 <:combat:797896050370281523> to use. All his tasks are for monsters that are in the Wilderness, and can only be completed in the Wilderness. Unlike other Slayer Masters, Mandrith assigns tasks irrespective of whether the player has blocked or preferred them.

A task from Mandrith awards 15 Slayer points plus the player's Threat level at time of completion. Completing Mandrith's Slayer tasks will award a Wilderness Slayer Chest. If the task is completed without dying or skipping it, 1 Reaper Point <:Reaperpoints:704657943194501140> is also awarded.
