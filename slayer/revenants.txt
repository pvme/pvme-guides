Revenants are a popular Wilderness slayer task because of their many collection log drops (~30) and their respective pets, dropped in the form of Revenant Spirits. Because of the high value of some of their unique drops, they're also good gp/hr.

> **__Method: Magic Legacy__**
.tag:methodmagiclegacy
.
After the Wilderness Update, killing Revenants has become substantially safer, as players can now opt-out of PvP. Despite that, some of their drops are still highly valued because of their rarity.

This method consists in killing them with Legacy combat, 1 by 1. Although it is low effort, it's not AFK due to their distance between spawn locations and long respawn time.
