.tag:introduction
Revenants are a popular Wilderness monster because of their various (~30) and their progressively unlocked pet, dropped in the form of Revenant Spirits <:revenantspirit:1023150742481158154>. With the high value of some of their unique drops, they're also decent gp/hr, although generally they're still inferior to other high levelled slayer monsters. After the Wilderness Update, killing Revenants has become substantially safer, as players can now opt-out of PvP.

> **__Method: Active Magic__**
.tag:methodmagiclegacy
The main method consists in killing them with Legacy combat, 1 by 1. This method can also be replicated with melee with an augmented revenant bane 2h sword.

⬥ Legacy with an <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> with <:ruthless3:712244800572883025> is used to consistently 1-shot revenants which minimises the effectiveness of their healing.
    • You should be able to 1-shot all revenants most of the time except for revenant dragon.

⬥ Use <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>. The healing from the spell alone should be sufficient to upkeep HP without needing <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>

**__Strategy__**
⬥ Revenant spawn times are not equal nor do they scale according to level. In fact, the knight and dragon are the fastest spawning revenants.
    • Thus, use routes that prioritise killing these 2 revenants as soon as they respawn to kill as many knights and dragons per hour, as they have the highest drop rates for uniques.

⬥ <:cannon:869283142350041098> placement is shown below. It is positioned to kill the southern revenant goblins and imp, occasionally being able to kill the pyrefiend, and lowering the dark beast and demon such that they can be consistently 1-shot.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/hAJb1MB50g.png
⬥ Recommended routes for active killing:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/mjtXJs8Zua.png
⬥ **Red** and **green**: Main routes to take when killing revenants between knight and dragon spawns.
⬥ **Blue** and **yellow**: Potential detour routes for red and green routes respectively depending on revenant movement.

⬥ When going from knight to dragon, kill 3-5 revenants. When going from dragon to knight, kill 2-3 revenants.
