> **__Shattered Worlds for Slayer XP__**

**__Introduction__**
Shattered Worlds is a 🏻💰 combat-based ♂🔫 minigame where 🌍 it's reward currency, Shattered Anima, is awarded for 👏 killing 🔪 mobs and 👏✔ achieving objectives in 📥🐩 the 👧 minigame. This currency 💵💴 can be 😡 used to 🙏 purchase a 👌 variety of 😿 abilities, titles, pets, slayer 🍆 masks and 💦 notably, Huge 💪 Slayer 🍆💦 XP Lamps. At ❤ level 99 🤑 this gives 😚 68'815 Slayer 💦💦 experience, 😋😋 at the 🍒💯 cost 💰 of 6m Anima. This 🚟👈 guide will go ♀🏻 over 😩 the 😱 most ❄ efficient 🔛🔛 method of 💰 farming Anima to 👏 purchase these 👈 lamps, to 💰👉 achieve high ⏫👑 Slayer 🍆🍆 XP rates. 😂

*Note: This method also gives high <:combat:797896050370281523> XP, but is not recommended as the main way to train slayer once the player is at a higher level, due to offering nothing but slayer XP.*

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Acceleration Powerburst** <:accel:756236265472524418> - Reduces the cooldown of mobility abilities such as Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> to 0.6s, allowing for extremely quick travel over large distances.

.
⬥ **Essence of Finality Amulet with Dark Bow spec** <:eofor:745279787471470713><:dbow:643848618553507843> - Required for optimal rates, allows for huge AoE damage to be dealt in conjunction with Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ The 🏼 best worlds to farm are 101-105, due 👅 to 👂 them starting with 👏 the Feeling 🤒💦 Pumped ✊ modifier, and ❌ having 👉 low HP mobs.
    • Feeling Pumped gives 😚😚 the player 🤺 unlimited 💯💪 adrenaline 💉💉 for 👻 10s upon 💰 activation, which allows the 🚮 player 🎮🎮 to deal massive 😯😯 damage ☠ in 🔱 a 💰 short 👉⬇ time, and 👏🎭 is required 📋✅ for this 🖖🏽 style 🍌👏 of farming.

.
⬥ Shattered worlds 😄😄 has ❌ 3 main objectives, kill X amount of 😴 enemies, deal X amount 🔢🔢 of damage, ☄ or 💁 repair the 💛💰 portal. Completing an objective quickly ⏰⏰ rewards the player 🎮 with skipping worlds 😄😄 in that 🏻 bracket, up ❤ to 💱💦 3 😏 worlds skipped if 🤔👏 the 🎇 first world 🌁 is 😍 completed in 🏼 under ⬇ 1 minute. ⌚⏰ 
    • To farm anima efficiently, skipping worlds 😄😄 is the 👍😭 priority. ⬆ However, due to 💦👮 RNG in 👇😬 the objectives, skipping 2 🙈 worlds is ♀ often more 😤😩 achievable.

.
⬥ Ranged <:range:580168050121113623> offers the most efficient way to farm these worlds, via the usage of the Dark bow special attack <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, stored in an Essence of Finality necklace <:eof:787526151978614824> to allow it to be used with Mechanical chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, allowing the player to often one-hit large groups of enemies. If Feeling Pumped has not activated yet, simply use basic abilities or thresholds like Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>. An example video is shown below featuring various world skips.

.
*Note: Melee can also be viable, having strong AoE potential with abilities such as (<:cleave:535532878616985610>, <:cane:535532878969438210>, <:quake:535532879506309150>, <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, <:bd:535532854281764884>), however will be significantly slower than ranged.*

.
⬥ As speed is the most important factor here, Acceleration potions <:accel:756236265472524418> can be particularly helpful for clearing large distances, to get to more enemies or to rush to the portal after finishing an objective. If getting to the portal quicker will help with world skips, use it, otherwise save it for the next world where it may come in more useful, this is up to the player's discretion.

.
⬥ The usage of Target Cycling is heavily recommended. This is due to auto-attacks stalling repeated Essence of Finality special attacks <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, preventing you from continuously speccing whilst Feeling Pumped is active. Targets can still be clicked if the player is careful not to auto-attack.

.
⬥ Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is used for all healing, as the massive damage dealt generates a lot of healing, but if more healing is required, the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> can be used. Solid food is also recommended, as adrenaline is effectively infinite, alongside healing a large amount in one bite and therefore has no downside.

.
⬥ The best modifiers to take after Feeling pumped are variable, but generally consistent. Electric, Explosive (if not using <:melee:615612332521029632>) and Charged. However, with an objective like kill X mobs, a negative modifier like Hydra can be positive. 
    • In the case 😎💦 of ❗ no 🙅 positive modifiers, options like 💟🏼 Zombie Apocalypse, Zone of Suffering 😤😥 or 💯 Hungry 😋 are the least 💦😴 negative 👏👏 options and 🙇 can 🔫 be ignored.
