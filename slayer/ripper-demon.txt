.tag:intro
Ripper Demons are one of the 4 Raptor Mobs, and provide by far the highest EXP rates among the group. This guide will go through the methods used to achieve the highest EXP rates at ripper demons.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill : 2159.5 + 712.6 <:constitution:689509250887712902>
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per kill : 2721.5
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: ~1650 <:melee:1096130867279171706> (~930 <:magic:689504724159823906>)
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~4.49M <:melee:1096130867279171706> (~2.53M <:magic:689504724159823906>)

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
.tag:drops
⬥ Ripper Demons have a valuable loot table containing: Wines of Zamorak, Rune salvage, coins and a variety of high level herbs.
    • This makes them one of the better tasks to do for gp.

⬥ When killed with Binding Contracts in your inventory, they are captured and turned into a Binding Contract (Ripper Demon) <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>
    • This provides a large buff to the GP/h of Ripper Demons, currently adding an extra <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ in revenue per kill.

.
⬥ For the Slayer log, Ripper Demons also drop:
    • Mainhand and offhand Ripper Claws <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444>
    • Cursed Amascut Sand <:cursedamascutsand:1023152063208763433>
    • The 5 Miner's journals
        ⬩ Required for <:masterquestcape:1091050888828813412>
    • The Parasitic orb <:parasiticorb:1023150740384006234>
        ⬩ A pet item that unlocks the Nipper Demon pet.
        ⬩ Dropped at a rate of 1/30,000 from Ripper Demons and 1/333 from Elite Ripper Demons.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
.tag:location
The two most popular locations to kill ripper demons are:
1. The Ripper Demon cave, South-east of the Al-Kharid <:alkharidlode:1032552328005419038> lodestone through a shortcut near the eastern gate. **The ripper demons here are not aggressive.**
2. The Ripper Demon horde west of demonic ruins. **The ripper demons here are aggressive.**
    a. This is the located used for the methods in this guide, as slayer in the wilderness is now risk-free.
    b. You can get here using the <:wildernesssword:1009419838764109834> teleport to the Herb patch or the games necklace teleport to Corporeal Beast. Travelling via the demonic ruins is risky as you may aggro a Kal'gerion demon and get spec'd.

⬥ Low kph methods such as single target killing will not be elaborated on in this guide. In short, bring your best melee gear with Darklight, <:vampscrim:513201294262009874> and <:vampaura:643505653079343144> and use the ripper demon cave with the midday skybox.

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ Teleport to the herb patch using <:wildernesssword:1009419838764109834> and run north then east until you see the first ripper.
⬥ Ensure the following are active:
    • <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> <:malevolence:513190159416557573> <:protectitem:1010486261682810891>
    • <:elderovl:841419289831800882> <:weppoison:689525476158472288>

.
⬥ To set up the method, follow the steps below (shown in video example below):
    • Use <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:dive:1049378668197195808> and place your <:cannon:869283142350041098>
    • Let <:autoretaliate:1084799717726228530> fire off <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> and AoE down the intial group of rippers attacking you immediately with <:cleave:535532878616985610> and <:dragonhalberd:841409589261238282> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • Move between the lava vents which funnels all attacking demons onto the same pile.

.
⬥ Targeted <:bd:535532854281764884> should be used to build adrenaline as often as possible **(DO NOT HAVE <:mob:689501908628799488> ON YOUR GEAR)**.
    • Try to <:bd:535532854281764884> rippers with less than 20k or so HP to reliably get resets.

.
⬥ The general rotation is based on cycling 3 things that work on 1 minute cycles - <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> and <:demonslayer:641339921675845633>
    • Equip <:reaverring:839903943018283050> and use <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, take advantage of <:critbuff:943518665842757644> to use as many <:dragonhalberd:841409589261238282> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as possible.
    • Your AoE abilities still take priority over <:dragonhalberd:841409589261238282> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • Use <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> + <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> after <:critbuff:943518665842757644> expires. Equip <:rod:513190159462825984>. Focus on getting <:bd:535532854281764884> resets.
    • After <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> ends <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> will soon be up, sip <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> to use it ASAP if necessary.

.
**__Revo bar__**
.
⬥ Let the bar autofire <:cleave:535532878616985610> as often as possible.

**__Video Example__**

Active - https://youtu.be/nVyJJb6-k8w

.
> **__Method: Low effort Magic__**
.tag:afk
Using a similar strategy as the active method, players can use magic with legacy to almost AFK ripper demons, autocasting <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, assuming the player owns best-in-slot magic armour (refer to preset below).

⬥ With damage reduction from <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, cryptbloom passive <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956>, <:infernalpuzzlebox:994189299681607800>, <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> with <:aos:513190158359724056> and <:enhdev4:712073087507628035>, players should be able to sustain themselves purely with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> healing alone.

⬥ After eating or drinking a potion, the player must click back on a ripper to prevent attacks from being delayed in legacy.

⬥ **Important**: You must **target the elite ripper** when it spawns to kill it before the jump as <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> deals only 60% to non-main targets.
    • This is the only caveat which prevents the method from being completely AFK.

.
**__Strategy__**
Turn on the <:scriptureofwen:883134307902816297> before you teleport. Teleport and walk up to the area boundary just before any ripper can aggro on you and check the following:
1. Deflect melee and Affliction active <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> <:affliction:513190158468907008>
2. Elder overloads and weapon poison +++ are active <:elderovl:841419289831800882> <:weppoison:689525476158472288>
3. Autocasting blood barrage and Animate dead is active <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:animatedead:856635090453135382>

⬥ Walk up and make sure you attack the demons between steps. This is the most dangerous part of the method as the first few demons are the slowest to kill since <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> is not active yet and you have no <:ruthless3:712244800572883025> stacks. Keep track of the demons on you and look out for jumps (refer to example video below).

⬥ Drink <:aggressionpotion:925794592199147581> once you are comfortably set up with <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> active.

.
**__Method: AFK Magic__**
.tag:afkmagic
.
The only method which allows ripper demons to be AFK'd involves the use of an alt, as well as combat training dummies <:mtxdummy:974503666407067738>. The method works by immediately gaining the aggression of any ripper that spawns, causing them to jump into a spot they cannot walk out from, thus prevents them from attacking you.

.
**__Strategy__**
By setting up your **melee** <:mtxdummy:974503666407067738> (red box) and alt (yellow box) below, one can trap ripper demons in an area once they jump to you with <:slaughter:535532879237873666> such that they cannot continue attacking you.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/NjsAyGm.png
⬥ It will be helpful to set an Alt1 alert on the alt account to prevent it from logging out.

⬥ **IMPORTANT NOTE (Courtesy of <@256447155005292546>)**
    • If the alt method is done properly, ripper demons should not be able to attack you **AT ALL** after they jump.
    • If you are getting attacked, your alt probably got **trampled**. When a ripper demon or another player passes through your alt, it makes your alt unable to block rippers, thus breaking the triangle.
        ⬩ Quick explanation of trampling: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCZKk8pCmjc>
        ⬩ The most simple way to fix this is to move your alt away and then back to the spot.

⬥ The <:mtxdummy:974503666407067738> only lasts for 10 minutes before expiring, so it is best to reset the setup when refreshing <:elderovl:841419289831800882> <:aggressionpotion:925794592199147581> by picking up your dummy and cannon and re-entering the cave to reset ripper aggro.
