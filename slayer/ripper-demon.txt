> __**Ripper Demons**__

.
> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Ripper Demons are one of the 4 Raptor Mobs, and provide both the highest experience and GP rates in the group. Due to this, and their mechanics, there are a few methods of dealing with them, which will be outlined below.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523>  XP per kill : 2159.5 + 712.6 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 2721.5
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: 1000 (Ranged) , 800 (Melee)
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~2.7m

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Ripper Demons have a valuable loot table; containing Wines of Zamorak, Rune salvage, coins and a variety of high level herbs, which make them one of the better tasks to do for gp. In addition to this, when killed with Binding Contracts in your inventory, they are captured and turned into a Binding Contract (Ripper Demon) <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> which provides a large buff to the GP/h of Ripper Demons, currently adding an extra ... per kill.

.
⬥ For the Slayer log, Ripper Demons also drop the mainhand and offhand Ripper Claws <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444> , Cursed Amascut Sand , the 5 Miner's journals  and finally, the Parasitic orb; a Pet item that unlocks the Nipper Demon pet, dropped at a rate of 1/30,000 from Ripper Demons and 1/333 from Elite Ripper Demons

This makes Ripper Demons <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ in pouches <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> alone, this makes them a very good gp task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Located in the Ripper Demon cave, South-east of Al-Kharid through a shortcut near the eastern gate. Teleporting via the lodestone is quick and simple, if in combat an amulet of glory can be used to teleport to Al-Kharid.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Demon Slayer (Perk)** <:demonslayerperk:689502842653900818> - A 7% damage increase to all damage dealt to Demons.

.
⬥ **Demon Slayer (Ability)** <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> - For the next 10 seconds, all damage against Demons is increased by 15%, 60 seconds cooldown.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the <:cannon:869283142350041098> to restock without requiring interaction.

.
⬥ **Laceration Boots** <:Laceration:602581988599398400> - Allows the player to cast Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> with a 2h, making the AoE effect hit in a 5x5 area with a halberd equipped.

.
⬥ **Death Ward** <:deathward:697808774068699286> - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%. This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement.

.
> **__Method__**
.tag:mechanics
**__Mechanics__**
Ripper Demons have a few mechanics:
⬥ When engaged from a distance, immediately teleport to the player and cast Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, which deals triple damage if the target moves.

.
⬥ They also have a Special attack, where adrenaline is built via auto-attacks and shown on the bar above their heads, when this bar fills they jump, and land where the player is standing shortly after, dealing up to 32000 damage and usually resulting in instant kill. This can be avoided by moving away from where you were standing immediately upon seeing them jump.

.
⬥ If the player is below 35% HP, all nearby Ripper Demons will immediately aggro to the player. If Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> is not active, teleport immediately.

.
⬥ When killed, spin around and hit any nearby players with weak rapid melee hits every tick in a 3x3 area, which can deal large damage if stood in.

.
⬥ Currently there are multiple methods of killing Ripper Demons, from low intensity low KPH to high intensity high KPH. They can also be done AFK in a Player-Owned Dungeon and fought 1v1 in the cave, however those are extremely low kph methods and do not require explaining. The methods are explained below.

.
> **__Ranged__**
.tag:range
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 1100 KPH

.
⬥ Ripper Demons have a low affinity to ranged attacks, however due to Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881> offering excellent AOE damage, Rippers can be done most effectively with ranged. This is done ideally with the usage of a melee combat training dummy, namely the ones only currently available off treasure hunter.

.
*Note: Ironmen can also attack treasure hunter dummies.*

.
⬥ To chin Ripper Demons effectively it requires good gear and good ability knowledge, alongside inventory management to increase profit with Binding Contracts. Starting with 100% adrenaline, stand in the most southern part of the first cave, as shown in the videos and image linked below. Pre-place the cannon to aggro the rippers in the room, start with Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and use dps rotations on the dummy. Place the cannon on the red square, stand on the yellow arrow and step into the yellow square, so that the dummy is placed on the blue square. Following the end of the ultimate, build to use Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> and switch back to chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. This is a good time to use the Demon Slayer ability <:demonslayer:641339921675845633>, to help upkeep damage and refund adrenaline. This will allow the next Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> to have excess adrenaline, which can be used in conjunction with the Dark Bow special attack, stored in an Essence of Finality <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, which deals huge damage for 65% adrenaline. Super Guthix Brews <:supergrest:690140078407680059> and Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> are used to maintain hp, alongside using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to block all melee hits for 20 seconds. There is a lot to keep in mind when chinning, it may take a few tries to get down the rotation consistently, so don't be discouraged! This method can also be done with a friend acting as a "tank", using Intercept <:Cept:543478434509357098> and defensive abilities to reduce the damage the chinner is taking, making for a smoother time.

.
⬥ When you get more comfortable with looting drops whilst continuing to deal damage, such as Wines of Zamorak or Blood runes, picking up sharks and placing them in the Pack Mammoth is strongly recommended to help increase the length of trips and extend the player's food supply, as they can be eaten losslessly with Mammoth Feast scrolls.

.
⬥ General Rotation
<:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> threshold rotation: <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:devo:513190158728953857> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566>

*Note: More thresholds can be used with excess adrenaline generated from crit refunds following Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>, however make sure not to over-use Dark Bow spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofor:745279787471470713> as it is heavy on adrenaline, use up to three times maximum if using Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031>.*

> **__Melee Semi-AOE__**
.tag:semi
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 700 KPH

.
⬥ This method involves the usage of the aggression ability and the Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> ability to allow for the semi-aoe aspect, where the player fights Rippers 1v1 in the small room until Devotion is off-cooldown, before aggro-ing multiple Rippers in the large room to AoE down whilst taking no damage. This method is extremely consistent and easy to do, whilst remaining low risk.

.
⬥ The rotation is as follows:
<:devo:513190158728953857> → <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + Aggression ability → AoEs such as <:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:quake:535532879506309150>/<:bd:535532854281764884> → Fight 1v1 in the small room → <:ricochet:535541259566186521>C4 → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → AoEs such as <:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:quake:535532879506309150>/<:bd:535532854281764884> → Repeat.

.
⬥ Make sure to use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> after killing a target for it to be lossless. Laceration Boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400> are extremely powerful here, allowing the player to use Blade Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> with a Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>, making for a large 5x5 AoE ability that resets cooldown upon the target dying, meaning it can be used often.

.
⬥ Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> will always tag Rippers even though it will splash, and if the player does not own a ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290>, they can replace it with Annihilation EoF spec <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofor:745279787471470713> or Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, however make sure to keep the Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> on after using the Annihilation. To deal with Elite spawns, simply target them as the main focus, as Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> will hit them twice. Use the Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> ability during the non-zerk AoE.

.
> **__Melee AOE__**
.tag:aoe
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 800 KPH

.
⬥ Similar to the semi-AoE method, full AoE relies on constant AoE abilities through the usage of Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> with Laceration Boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400>, but this method uses an Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> and Aggression potions to constantly upkeep Ripper aggression. Due to their hard hitting attacks, this method relies on healing through a Pack Mammoth with lossless food such as Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> / Guthix Rests <:grest:689530593901412578>, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>.

.
⬥ Stand to the east of the cave, place the Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> on the red square shown in the image below, and step back east to the yellow square to attack the demons. Use the Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ability when you have Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> active, similar to the previous method, and in between use ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> and Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> to keep damage high. If attacking multiple demons without a damage boosting effect, this is a good time to use your Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> ability to help keep damage high. If all the Rippers in the room are dead, step north to the other yellow square to escape the spin and reduce damage taken. Alloy Spikes <:armourspike:756235792053174332> are useful here to provide more hitsplats for poison damage.

.
⬥ Usage of auto-retaliate can be useful for situational 2h auto attacks. Dead Ripper Demons can still be clicked while performing their death spin attack, but cannot be targeted. This can sometimes make it difficult to target the correct Ripper Demon through clicking, making auto-retaliate a reasonable option here. Target Cycling can also be used, but will lose the easy access to a 2h auto attack.

.
> **__Legacy Magic__**
.tag:magic
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 700 KPH

.
⬥ This method also uses the dummy method like the ranged setup, but uses legacy blood burst with an Inquisitor's Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> to damage the Rippers. This can achieve ~700 KPH which is very good for an AFK method, but does require upfront gear investment in the form of an Inquisitor's staff. The method is mostly reliable, however can be prone to getting hit by the Ripper's special attack, where the player would need to move. Due to the nature of Blood spells' secondary targets taking reduced damage, if the player is active they should target attacking rippers to ensure no special attacks. Place the cannon and dummy in the same spot as the ranged method.

.
⬥ The usage of a Unicorn Stallion is recommended to provide extra healing if necessary, alongside Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> or healing potions such as Super Guthix Brews <:supergrest:690140078407680059> / Saradomin Brews <:Brew:565726489400573962>, as they will not severely delay your attacks.

.
⬥ This method can reach higher XP/h than the melee method despite being lower kph, as a Scrimshaw of Sacrifice can be utilised effectively, as it does not affect Binding Contracts, maintaining a bulk of the profit.

.
⬥ Make sure auto-retaliate is OFF. A lot of actions will stop you from automatically attacking the dummy in Legacy. As such, it will occasionally be necessary to click the dummy again (alternatively, the player can click the spell in their spellbook to cast their spell again without having to click the dummy, but this does not work while the 'manual spellcasting' option in the game settings is enabled). Having auto retaliate turned off ensures that you don't accidentally target the wrong NPC.
