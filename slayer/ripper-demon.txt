> __**Ripper Demons**__

.
> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Ripper Demons are one of the 4 Raptor Mobs, and provide both the highest experience and GP rates in the group. Due to this, and their mechanics, there are a few methods of dealing with them, which will be outlined below.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523>  XP per kill : 2159.5 + 712.6 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 2721.5
⬥ Optimal kills per hour: 1000 (Ranged) , 800 (Melee)
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~2.7m

.
**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Ripper Demons have a valuable loot table containing: Wines of Zamorak, Rune salvage, coins and a variety of high level herbs.
    • This makes them one of the better tasks to do for gp.

⬥ When killed with Binding Contracts in your inventory, they are captured and turned into a Binding Contract (Ripper Demon) <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>
    • This provides a large buff to the GP/h of Ripper Demons, currently adding an extra <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Slayer!D49$ per kill.

.
⬥ For the Slayer log, Ripper Demons also drop:
    • Mainhand and offhand Ripper Claws <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444>
    • Cursed Amascut Sand
    • The 5 Miner's journals
    • The Parasitic orb
        - A pet item that unlocks the Nipper Demon pet
        - Dropped at a rate of 1/30,000 from Ripper Demons and 1/333 from Elite Ripper Demons

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
⬥ Located in the Ripper Demon cave, South-east of Al-Kharid through a shortcut near the eastern gate.
    • Teleporting via the lodestone is quick and simple.
        - If in combat an amulet of glory can be used to teleport to Al-Kharid.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Demon Slayer (Perk)** <:demonslayerperk:689502842653900818> - 7% damage increase against Demons.

.
⬥ **Demon Slayer (Ability)** <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> - 15% damage against Demons for 10s, 60s cooldown.

.
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** - Allows the <:cannon:869283142350041098> to restock without user input.

.
⬥ **Laceration Boots** <:Laceration:602581988599398400> - Allows for 2-handed Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>
    • This makes the AoE hit in a 5x5 area with a halberd equipped.

.
⬥ **Death Ward** <:deathward:697808774068699286> - 5% damage reduction when your life points are below 50%; 10% damage reduction when they are below 25%
    • This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement.

.
> **__Method__**
.tag:mechanics
**__Mechanics__**
Ripper Demons have a few mechanics:
⬥ When engaged from a distance, they immediately teleport to the player and cast Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.
    • This deals triple damage if the target moves.

.
⬥ They also have a Special attack, where adrenaline is built via auto-attacks and shown on the bar above their heads.
    • When this bar fills they jump, and land where the player is standing shortly after, dealing up to 32000 damage and usually resulting in instant kill
        - This can be avoided by moving away from where you were standing immediately upon seeing them jump.

.
⬥ If the player is below 35% HP, all nearby Ripper Demons will immediately aggro to the player.
    • If Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> is not active, teleport immediately.

.
⬥ When killed, they spin around and hit any nearby players with weak rapid melee hits every tick in a 3x3 area, which can deal large damage if stood in.

.
⬥ Currently there are multiple methods of killing Ripper Demons, from low intensity low KPH to high intensity high KPH, which are explained below.
    • They can also be done AFK in a Player-Owned Dungeon and fought 1v1 in the cave, however those are extremely low kph methods and do not require explaining.

.
> **__Ranged__**
.tag:range
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 1100 KPH

.
⬥ Due to Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881> offering excellent AOE damage, Rippers can be done most effectively with ranged, despite their low affinity to ranged attacks
    • This is done ideally with the usage of a melee combat training dummy, namely the ones only currently available off treasure hunter.

.
*Note: Ironmen can also attack treasure hunter dummies.*

.
⬥ To chin Ripper Demons effectively it requires good gear and good ability knowledge, alongside inventory management to increase profit with Binding Contracts.

⬥ Starting with 100% adrenaline, stand in the most southern part of the first cave, as shown in the videos and image linked below.
    • Pre-place the cannon to aggro the rippers in the room, start with Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> and use dps rotations on the dummy.
        - Place the cannon on the red square, stand on the yellow arrow and step into the yellow square, so that the dummy is placed on the blue square.
    • Following the end of the ultimate, build to use Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> and switch back to chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.
        - This is a good time to use the Demon Slayer ability <:demonslayer:641339921675845633>, to help upkeep damage and refund adrenaline. This will allow the next Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> to have excess adrenaline, which can be used in conjunction with the Dark Bow special attack, stored in an Essence of Finality <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofor:745279787471470713>, which deals huge damage for 65% adrenaline.

⬥ Super Guthix Brews <:supergrest:690140078407680059> and Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> are used to maintain hp, alongside using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to block all melee hits for 20 seconds.

⬥ There is a lot to keep in mind when chinning, it may take a few tries to get down the rotation consistently, so don't be discouraged!

⬥ This method can also be done with a friend acting as a "tank", using Intercept <:Cept:543478434509357098> and defensive abilities to reduce the damage the chinner is taking, making for a smoother time.

.
⬥ When you get more comfortable with looting drops whilst continuing to deal damage, such as Wines of Zamorak or Blood runes, picking up sharks and placing them in the Pack Mammoth is strongly recommended to help increase the length of trips and extend the player's food supply, as they can be eaten losslessly with Mammoth Feast scrolls.

.
⬥ General Rotation
<:deathsswift:535541258924326912> threshold rotation: <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:devo:513190158728953857> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566>

*Note: More thresholds can be used with excess adrenaline generated from crit refunds following Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>, however make sure not to over-use Dark Bow spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as it is heavy on adrenaline, use up to three times maximum if using Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>.*

.
> **__Melee Semi-AOE__**
.tag:semi
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 700 KPH

.
⬥ This method involves the usage of the aggression ability and the Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> ability to allow for the semi-aoe aspect, where the player fights Rippers 1v1 in the small room until Devotion is off-cooldown, before aggro-ing multiple Rippers in the large room to AoE down whilst taking no damage. This method is extremely consistent and easy to do, whilst remaining low risk.

.
⬥ The rotation is as follows:
<:devo:513190158728953857> → <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + Aggression ability → AoEs such as <:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:quake:535532879506309150>/<:bd:535532854281764884> → Fight 1v1 in the small room → <:ricochet:535541259566186521>C4 → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → AoEs such as <:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:quake:535532879506309150>/<:bd:535532854281764884> → Repeat.

.
⬥ Make sure to use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> after killing a target for it to be lossless. Laceration Boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400> are extremely powerful here, allowing the player to use Blade Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> with a Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>, making for a large 5x5 AoE ability that resets cooldown upon the target dying, meaning it can be used often.

.
⬥ Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> will always tag Rippers even though it will splash, and if the player does not own a ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290>, they can replace it with Annihilation EoF spec <:annihilation:796989662983094275> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> or Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, however make sure to keep the Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> on after using the Annihilation. To deal with Elite spawns, simply target them as the main focus, as Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> will hit them twice. Use the Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> ability during the non-zerk AoE.

.
> **__Melee AOE__**
.tag:aoe
**__Method__**
⬥ Up to 800 KPH

.
⬥ Similar to the semi-AoE method, full AoE relies on constant AoE abilities through the usage of Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> with Laceration Boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400>, but this method uses an Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> and Aggression potions to constantly upkeep Ripper aggression. Due to their hard hitting attacks, this method relies on healing through a Pack Mammoth with lossless food such as Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> / Guthix Rests <:grest:689530593901412578>, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>.

.
⬥ Stand to the east of the cave, place the Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> on the red square shown in the image below, and step back east to the yellow square to attack the demons. Use the Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ability when you have Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> active, similar to the previous method, and in between use ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> and Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> to keep damage high. If attacking multiple demons without a damage boosting effect, this is a good time to use your Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> ability to help keep damage high. If all the Rippers in the room are dead, step north to the other yellow square to escape the spin and reduce damage taken. Alloy Spikes <:armourspike:756235792053174332> are useful here to provide more hitsplats for poison damage.

.
⬥ Usage of auto-retaliate can be useful for situational 2h auto attacks. Dead Ripper Demons can still be clicked while performing their death spin attack, but cannot be targeted. This can sometimes make it difficult to target the correct Ripper Demon through clicking, making auto-retaliate a reasonable option here. Target Cycling can also be used, but will lose the easy access to a 2h auto attack.

.
> **__Legacy Magic__**
.tag:magic
**__Method__**
⬥ Around 650 KPH

.
⬥ Use legacy Blood Burst <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> with an Inquisitor's Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> to damage the Rippers.

.
⬥ Due to the nature of Blood spells' secondary targets taking reduced damage, active players should look out for and target any attacking Elite rippers to ensure no special attacks.

.
⬥ Stand at western corner of cave beside the northern box as shown below and set up your Oldak Coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> or Kinetic Cyclone <:kineticcyclone:798285651405438997> within melee distance.

.
.img:https://imgur.com/WqBeore.png
.
⬥ If owning lesser gear, or looking for a more afk and safer method, one can prevent ripper demons from auto attacking completely with the help of an alt.
    • Positions for cannon, dummy (red box), the alt account (yellow box) and player standing positions (bottom left) are shown below.
    • It is helpful to set an Alt1 alert on the alt account to prevent it from logging out.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/NjsAyGm.png
.
⬥ Use Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> to almost completely eliminate the need for healing.
    • Bring Blue Blubber Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> or Super Guthix Brews <:supergrest:690140078407680059> for emergency healing, as they will not severely delay your attacks.
    • The only tank armour pieces that are needed are helmet and boots, but players may take more pieces if finding it difficult to sustain.

.
⬥ You may use Scrimshaws of Sacrifice for higher exp rates and still profit from contracts.

.
⬥ Make sure auto-retaliate is OFF to avoid attacking the wrong NPC **if using the dummy method**.

.
Many actions will stop you from automatically attacking a dummy in Legacy. It will occasionally be necessary to click the dummy again.
    • Players can click the spell in their spellbook to cast their spell without having to click the dummy, but this does not work with manual spellcasting.

.
⬥ If using the alt method, use the Dwarven siege engine <:cannon:869283142350041098> for faster aggression.

⬥ If using the alt method, Attuned Ectoplasmator and Demon Horn Necklace may be used for prayer restoration.
