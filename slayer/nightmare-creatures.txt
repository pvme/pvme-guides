> __**Nightmare Creatures**__

__Introduction__
⬥ Unlockable for 50 slayer points after the completion of the Children of Mah quest, Nightmare Creatures are powerful slayer creatures, requiring 80 <:slayer:797896049548066857> to kill. They offer good XP rates, good GP rates, afk-ability and a high valued unique.

__Stats:__
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523>  XP per kill : 1954 + 645 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857>  XP per kill : 1540
⬥ Optimal <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per hour : ~1050k

__Desirable drops:__
⬥ Nightmares have a strong common drop table, offering a large amount of alchables, fletching supplies, and coins, alongside being a very good source of Soul runes.
⬥ For the slayer log, Nightmares also drop the Nightmare Gauntlets <:NMG:513190159441723392>, a set of powerful range gloves that are best-in-slot in some scenarios. These are dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10000 off-task.

__Location and how to get there:__
⬥Nightmare Creatures are located at the Ritual site on Freneskae, accessible through the World Gate after completion of the quest Children of Mah. Bring a Sixth-Age circuit for an easy teleport.

__Useful items:__
⬥ Restocking cannon ability - Allows the cannon to restock without requiring interaction.
⬥ Sixth-Age Circuit - Allows for an easy teleport to the World Gate.
⬥ <:armourspike:756235792053174332> Alloy spikes are very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>.

__Method__
⬥ Nightmares have two forms of attacks, a weaker melee auto-attack, and a ranged special attack which can deal large amounts of damage in 2 hits. Due to this, when killing nightmares it is recommended to pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and use a form of healing such as a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> or Blood spells <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> from the Ancient spellbook.
⬥Both melee and magic can be used to kill Nightmares optimally, and the strategy between the styles does not change. Place your cannon at the spot shown in the image below, and stand next to the large pillar with <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and auto-retaliate on. Melee suffers from a lower hitchance than magic, therefore an aura such as <:brawler:643505376917979138> could be used if the healing from <:vamp:643505653079343144> is not required. Manually inputting <:bd:535532854281764884> or <:zgs:626465964325601290><:spec:537340400273195028> will greatly increase AoE damage and increase the kph.
⬥Magic is used via Legacy mode, as the healing offered from Blood spells is extremely strong, alongside hard hitting auto-attacks. Due to the nature of the Inquisitor's staff, the spell Blood Burst can be used for a small damage reduction whilst saving a large amount of blood runes, which one could do to improve profits. Due to Nightmare Creatures' high accuracy, they can deal large amounts of damage in short periods of time, so higher tiered armour or even tank armour should be used when maging in legacy, to mitigate the damage taken.

⬥Place the cannon on the red square, and stand on the yellow square after loading it with cannonballs. The player may have a chance to be walked backwards one square if they attack a Nightmare that is running towards them, in this case simply click back onto the highlighted square.
