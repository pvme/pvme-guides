**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Nightmares 😱 have 👏 a strong common 🐩 drop 🏿⤵ table, 🎲 offering a large 🏔😵 amount of 💰 alchables, fletching supplies, and coins, alongside being 😑🐝 a very 👌 good 😇👌 source 😔 of Soul 👻👻 runes.

.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Nightmare Creatures are 😬 located at the Ritual site 💻💻 on 😁 Freneskae, accessible through ⏬▶ the World ⛏🌏 Gate after completion of 💦 the quest Children 💞 of Mah. Bring ⬅ a 🅰 Sixth-Age circuit for 👥 an easy teleport.

.
**__Useful Items__**
⬥ **Restocking Cannon Ability** 👉 - Allows the 💓 cannon to restock without requiring interaction. 🗣
⬥ **Sixth-Age Circuit** - Allows for 💰⌛ an 👏 easy ❓ teleport to ♂😩 the 👏 World 😣🌎 Gate. 🚧
⬥ **Alloy spikes** <:armourspike:756235792053174332> are very strong here, allowing for increased poison hits and healing via the usage of a scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and the Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>.

.
**__Method__**
⬥ Nightmares have two forms of attacks, a weaker melee auto-attack, and a ranged special attack which can deal large amounts of damage in 2 hits. Due to this, when killing nightmares it is recommended to pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and use a form of healing such as a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> or Blood spells <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> from the Ancient spellbook.

.
⬥ Both melee and magic can be used to kill Nightmares optimally, and the strategy between the styles does not change. Place your <:cannon:798285653418573865> at the spot shown in the image below, and stand next to the large pillar with <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and auto-retaliate on. Use strong AoE abilities, the AFK bar in <#796067367725432833> can be used.
    • Melee suffers from a lower hitchance than magic, therefore an aura such as <:brawler:643505376917979138> could be used if the healing from <:vamp:643505653079343144> is not required. 
    • Manually inputting <:bd:535532854281764884> or <:zgs:626465964325601290><:spec:537340400273195028> will greatly increase AoE damage and increase the kph.

.
⬥ Magic ✨✨ is 💦 used 😏 via 💰💰 Legacy mode, as 🖕 the healing offered from 👉 Blood 💉 spells is 💦🙄 extremely ☣ strong, alongside hard hitting 😦 auto-attacks. Due 👅👅 to the nature 🍃🍁 of 🚋 the Inquisitor's staff, the 🏆 spell 🏻🏻 Blood Burst can 👍 be 🐝💦 used 👨📅 for 😏 a 🍞 small 😂🏼 damage reduction whilst 🎩 saving a large amount 📉 of 🅱 blood runes, which 🙌♀ one ☝☝ could do to improve profits. Due 👅 to Nightmare Creatures' 🐵🐵 high 🕛🍁 accuracy, 🏹🏹 they ⁉ can 🚫 deal large amounts of 🕯 damage ☄ in 🌆 short periods of time, 👌🕐 so higher 🔝 tiered armour or 💁😩 even 🌩🏼 tank armour should 💘 be 🍆🙅 used 🚟 when 🕐 maging in legacy, to 🙏💦 mitigate the 👏 damage ☄☄ taken. 🔫😔
