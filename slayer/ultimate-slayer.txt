**__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
⬥ The Ultimate Slayer title is obtained by completing every collection in the slayer skill. In this guide you will all the tips and tricks to making the grind as smooth as possible. With the recent update to the wilderness, it has become a very popular goal for many players because of pvp being able to be turned off.
This made tasks like Lava Strykewyrms, Revenants and Ripper demons a very safe and hassle free task.
⬥ A basic list of items/consumables/auras/relics can be found in <#1022859930606243911>.
⬥ Task specific guides can be found in <#1020024227115573369>.

.
**__Useful Items__**
.tag:usefulitems
Players who find themselves going for this title should know and obtain a couple of items that will greatly help them on their journey.

.
**__Consumables__**
.tag:consumables
⬥ **Fellstalk incense stick**s <:FellstalkSticks:690987265421213746>
    • Each potency level of Fellstalk incense sticks provides a x1.01 spawn chance to elite NPCs, up to a maximum increased chance of approximately 4% (each tier stacks through multiplication).
    • The potency level will increase every 10 minutes and will reach its maximum at level 4. Overloading consumes 6 sticks but instantly provides the maximum potency.
    • Very important item for tasks such as: Ripper Demons, Edimmu and Rune Dragons.

⬥ **Lantadyme incense sitcks** <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368>
    • Each potency level increases potion timers by 30 seconds, up to a maximum 2 minute increase.
Nice to have but not required at all.

⬥ **Potion Reservoir** <:potionreservoir:878739200407654431>
    • Allows for any potion with a timer to be automatically consumed.

⬥ **Powder of penance** <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226>
    • Good alternative to Penance if on cooldown.

⬥ **Slayer VIP ticket** <:slayervip:975284344597934120>
    • While Slayer VIP tickets are usually obtained via Travelling Merchant or Cabbage Facepunch Bonanza minigame, there is another method to obtaining them quickly. Killing the begineer version of mimic can yield about 30+ slayer VIP tickets depending on luck.

⬥ **Seeker's Charm** <:seekerscharm:1027212537411932160>
    • These are dropped by seekers <:seeker:1004107313424117951>, and are offered to the portal in the northern part of the stalker dungeon to increase the chance of elite soulgazers appearing from 1/50 to 1/10.

.
**__Most wanted cards__**
.tag:Limited items
⬥ These cards are obtained as a weekly reward from the platinum mode of Rush Of Blood. They have a chance of increasing the drop rates of a unique item for their respective monsters. Each card starts with 100 charges, and a charge is used for every monster of that type killed with the card in the inventory.
⬥ They are most notably very worth using at Glacors and Automatons.

⬥ Most Wanted card (abyssal demons) <:mostwantedcardabbydemon:1005877256884867152>
⬥ Most Wanted card (automatons) <:mostwantedcardautomaton:1005877287327125594>
⬥ Most Wanted card (glacors) <:mostwantedcardglacor:1005877303722659840>
⬥ Most Wanted card (tormented demons) <:mostwantedcardtormenteddemon:1005877321212907561>

***Note: Multiple of each cards cannot be obtained! You will always obtain the one you are missing.***

.
**__Daily Tasks with Slayer masks__**
.tag:dailymasks
⬥ There are 2 main reasons why you should be forcing 1 task per day with specific slayer masks:
        1. Easy points that will add over time.
        2. Removes the need to use lower tier slayer masters.

⬥ Using slayer masks for task only drops is a high priority especially for tasks like:
    • Ice strykewyrm <:icestrykewyrm:1004107267915907166>, Desert strykewyrm <:desertstrykewyrm:1004107266313703566> and Jungle strykewyrm <:junglestrykewyrm:1004107264459821066> (Hexcrest, Focus sight and Staff of light)
    • Airut <:airut:1004107275562139648> (Razorback gauntlets)
    • Abyssal demon <:abyssaldemon:1004107332478840873> (Abyssal wand and orb)
    • Note: Other slayer masks such as Mask of Kurask/Basilisks/Stone provide a boost in drop chance for their respected head item.

.
**__Task prioritization__**
.tag:taskpriority
****Disclamer! This section assumes a couple of things:
⬥ You own the Slayer master cape <:slayercape:975284344123953164>
⬥ Laniakea is your main slayer master
⬥ You are starting with mostly empty logs
⬥ Block/Prefer lists are based on task weighing and general level of annoyance of the task
****    • The Slayer master cape has a perk that gives a 20% chance to choose what a new task will be from a Slayer master. With this in mind there are a couple of tasks that should have priority over others. The last thing you want is having little to no points and your last item is a edimmu pet which can be very hard to obtain.

**__Tips and tricks__**

.tag:tipstricks
.
**Obtaining Revenant drop enhancers for free**

Tasks that should be done in the wilderness during Ultimate Slayer:
    • Ripper demons <:ripperdemon:1004107343123976284>
    • Lava Strykewyrms <:lavastrykewyrm:1004107339126808627>
    • Abyssal Creatures <:abyssallord:1004107327126904842> <:abyssalbeast:1004107328964014100> <:abyssaldemon:1004107332478840873>
    • Hydrix Dragons (optional) <:hydrixdragon:1004107337415544854>

**Slayer cape perk farming**

This method is focused on rolling the slayer choice perk. This is achieved with 2 slayer masters, Jacquelyn and Laniakea. The basic idea is that slayer masks prevent you from being assigned tasks that you do not want and Slayer cape perk having prioirity over forced tasks from masks, therefore you can simply exit the chat option if cape fails.

⬥ **Requirements**
    • Access to lunar spellbook: Spellbook swap (Lunar) <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> + NPC Contact <:npccontact:975284195280695326>
    • Slayer master cape <:slayercape:975284344123953164> at all times
    • Higher level slayer mask <:maskoftheabyss:1004325563068071936>(Black demons, Airuts, Automatons etc)
    • A magic or range weapon with Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336>
    • Your blocklist should look like as you are farming slayer points with Jacquelyn
.

⬥ **Method: STEP BY STEP**
    **STEP 1**: You equip your slayer mask and <:npccontact:975284195280695326> Laniakea.

	**STEP 2**: Once you have done that there are 2 things that happen:
				a) Your slayer cape gives you the choice of picking your own task.
        → You do the task and repeat **Step 1**.

				b) Your cape did not work therefor you got are given the option of being assigned the task specific to your slayer mask. **__Do not accept the task and simply exit the dialog __**.
	**STEP 3**: Remove your slayer mask and <:npccontact:975284195280695326> Jacquelyn and do a task from her. You **__MUST__** do a task from Jacquelyn, otherwise this method does not work.
