> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
Gemstone dragons are high level slayer mobs with high HP and moderately hard-hitting magic and melee auto attacks. When off-task, they require an entrance fee to kill outside of the Dragonkin Laboratory, making them unviable to kill without a slayer task outside the Elite Dungeon. There are three types: Dragonstone dragons, Onyx dragons, and Hydrix dragons. In addition to a dragonbreath attack, each variety of dragon has a special attack where the dragon fires out a set of gemstone spikes, creating a 3x3 area centered around the player and dealing high magic damage. Additionally, gemstone spikes have the following effects:
⬥ Dragonstone Dragon: Halves the duration of antifire and super antifire. This **does NOT work only** on extended super antifire.
⬥ Onyx Dragon: Heals the dragon by up to 5000 LP.
⬥ Hydrix Dragon: Drains adrenaline to 0 and halves adrenaline gain for 15 seconds.

⬥ **Set-ups and actions bars might not be optimised due to a lack of testing, if you have something to recommend changing, feel free to post in <#537042924026724353>.**
.
**__Desirable Drops__**
⬥ Besides the Draconic Visage (1/1000) which most dragons drop, different dragons drop the different pieces of Gemstone Armour (T80 hybrid, unaugmentable) required for the Karamja slayer log:
    • Dragonstone Dragon: Gemstone Gloves and Boots
    • Onyx Dragon: Gemstone Helmet and Greaves
    • Hydrix Dragon: Gemstone Hauberk

⬥ All Gemstone Armour pieces are dropped at a rate of 1/5000 off-task and 1/2000 on-task.

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
Gemstone dragons are located below the Shilo Village Mines. A ladder leads to the cavern beside Kelhar, whom you must pay Uncut Dragonstones, Onyxes or Hydrixes to if you choose to kill the dragons off-task. You need Karamka Gloves 3 or higher to access the cavern. Karamja Gloves also provide the fastest method to get there as they teleport you directly to the mines.

.
**__Useful Items__**
.tag:items
⬥ **Scrimshaw of Sacrifice** - As dragons do not have many valuable drops, this can be used for 50% increased slayer and combat exp, which works well on these monsters with already high base slayer exp.

⬥ **Dragon slayer gloves** - Can either used as a switch for 15% more slayer xp, or camped for that and a 10% accuracy boost at the cost of slightly less KPH from losing the Cinderbane Gloves <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812> passive.

.
⬥ **Dominion Mines** - As the dragons all have high HP and combat levels that fall within the Dominion Mine's range, these can be used for more KPH if actively killing them.

⬥ **Demon Horn Necklace** - Although dragons drop somewhat pricey Hardened Dragon Bones which can be collected and noted for more profit, if doing tasks AFK and not using the Scrimshaw of Sacrifice, players can use this to upkeep prayer points.

.
**__General Method__**
Magic or Ranged can be used, Ranged should mostly be used actively due to the viability of Mechanical Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. Magic is more effective if using AFK strategies. The ranged active method is written out in detail under Hydrix dragons but is applicable to all 3 dragons.

.
**__Dragonstone dragons__**
.tag:dragonstone
Dragonstone dragons are the easiest of the 3 and should only really be done for the slayer log. If undergeared or not confident, using extended super antifires is recommended to take less damage from dragonbreath, especially if AFKing.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> level: 95
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill: 2781.4 + 917.8 HP
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP per kill: 1448.4

⬥ Optimal kills  <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP hour - 402k (603k with Scrimshaw of Sacrifice)

.
**__AFK method__**
It is ideal to kill them one at a time, using an Oldak Coil to cycle through 2 spawns in the south eastern corner of the cavern.

.

⬥ Tank armour with Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> for Magic is unecessary but can be used for a little more safety if uncertain.

⬥ Cannon and player placements are shown below. Unless one of the dragons walks immediately after spawning, both dragons should always be in melee distance, and you should be avoid specs almost entirely.

**__Onyx dragons__**
.tag:onyx
Onyx dragons generally aren't done much unless for the slayer log, as players at this level should simply boost to kill Hydrix dragons actively for faster exp.

.
**__Stats__**
⬥ <:slayer:797896049548066857> level: 98
⬥ <:combat:797896050370281523> XP per kill: 3574.8 + 1179.6 HP

⬥ Optimal kills  <:slayer:797896049548066857> XP hour - 500k (750k with Scrimshaw of Sacrifice)

.
**__AFK method__**
Onyx dragons are more spaced out (harder to avoid specs) and damaging, making it impractical to AFK using ranged.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ 3 pieces of Cryptbloom Armour <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956>

⬥ Cannon and player placements are shown below. Because the area is quite open, more spawns can wander into the Oldak Coil's range and you will sometimes even fight 4 dragons at a time.

**__Hydrix dragons__**
.tag:hydrix
Hydrix dragons is relevant to players desiring slayer log completion and exp. They provide more than twice the slayer exp per kill of Onyx dragons and is considered one of the higest exp/hr tasks in the game if done actively.

.
⬥ The physical <:ecb:615618531937222657> is completely unecessary, and is only convenient to have for luring dragons to be chinned, as demonstrated below.

⬥ Place the cannon and position as shown in the picture below. Place your Death's Swiftnesses <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> around the area the player is positioned in the picture.

⬥ The main dragons you'll be chinning are the ones in the top right (yellow box) which your Oldak Coil will aggro and align for you. The dragons shown in the blue and red boxes can be opportunistically chinned if you managed to lure them correctly.
    • Use SGB Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088>, Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> with <:mechchin:641669268722810881> prioritized in that order to quickly kill them.
    • Chin Deadshot <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:deadshot:535541307666595870> can be used when out of <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518>.
    • Use <:dommine:662249620579155968> and <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> to quickly kill dragons single target.

⬥ Pay close attention to the dragons' specs especially if you have more than 2 attacking you.

.
**__AFK method__**
Hydrix dragons are a little impractical to AFK as their special attack drains your adrenaline, but can be done so at about half the KPH or more.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ 3 pieces of Cryptbloom Armour <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956> or 2 pieces while autocasting Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>
