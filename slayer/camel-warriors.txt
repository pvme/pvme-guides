Camel Warriors are one of the 4 Raptor Mobs, generally killed for their collection log. As such, they should **only be killed on task where they are 5x more likely to drop the <:camelstaff:917025698479210528>**

⬥ Camel warriors have one main mechanic - After taking some damage, they split into 3 mirages - Blood, Smoke and Shadow. Each has their own unique abilities, and attack with magic attacks.
    • Shadow mirages - Drains prayer points after charging the bar above their heads.
    • Blood mirages - Heal other mirages for ~900 HP per attack.
    • Smoke mirages - cast the Confuse, Weaken and Snare spells on the player, reducing hitchance and damage by 5%, and freezing you in place for 10s.

⬥ This mechanic can be very annoying to deal with normally as you need to kill all 3 mirages before being able to kill the Camel Warrior. **As such, both the best active and AFK methods focus on using tricks that bypass the mechanic entirely.**

**__Desirable Drops__**
.tag:drops
.
⬥ Camel Warriors have a valuable loot table, however, due to how slow it is to kill them, they have an underwhelming gp/hr. They are killed for their Slayer log drops:
    • Camel Staff <:camelstaff:917025698479210528> (1 / 2.000 on task, 1 / 10.000 off task)
    • The Ugthanatos (1 / 25)
    • Cursed Amascut Sand (1 / 1.024)
    • Raptor key part 3 (1 / 256)

.
**__Location and How to Get There__**
.tag:location
⬥ They can be found on the island east of Sophanem, which is accessed via stepping stones (no <:agility:1039864819760758844> level needed) near a large group of crocodiles. The area is affected by desert heat.
    • The quickest way to get there is via travelling south from Pharaoh's sceptre/Sceptre of the Gods option 2.
    • Alternatively, is it also possible to reach there via a gate in the eastern wall of Sophanem that allows easier access from the city.

This method works by using damage boosting auras, equipment and relics allowing <:tuskas:513201065513058306> to *theoretically* hit for more than 20,125 consistently when on task (although it is capped at 15,000). This may not be consistent if the user has anything less than 120 <:slayer:797896049548066857>. To understand why this does not phase camel warriors, watch the video guide below.

⬥ The completion of **Crocodile Tears** is highly recommended for this method to work well as you're constantly on extremely low HP to take advantage of <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> and cannot afford to take damage from desert heat.

⬥ Steps to setup:
    • Use Enchanted Lyre option 7/Fremennik sea boots to teleport to Fremennik.
    • Enter the building as shown below, climb up the ladder and spam click the chest to lower HP. Stop once your HP is lower than 1k as it is possible to die from the chest.
    • Travel to the camel warrior location while eating the dwarven rock cake to lower your HP **below 100.**
    • Kill Crocodiles before hopping over to the camel island if stacking <:ruthless3:712244800572883025>. Make sure you get 12 <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> stacks if using <:magic:689504724159823906>

⬥ The method itself involves building adrenaline with revo, stalling <:tuskas:513201065513058306> on a <:mtxdummy:974503666407067738>, using target cycle, and then using a spell to release <:tuskas:513201065513058306> along with a spec to kill camels instantly.

.tag:camelafk
.
This method involves not engaging in combat with the Camel Warriors at all, relying on cannon <:cannon:869283142350041098> and poison damage <:poisonicon:944649693500154006> which passively kill the Camel Warriors without triggering their mirage mechanic.

⬥ Place the <:cannon:869283142350041098> in the Camel Warrior island, while staying in the tiny island before the stepping stones, as shown below:
.

.
⬥ Players can do other activities in the meantime (e.g. Fletching <:fletching:1039864817881722960>). To avoid engaging in combat, players must bring runes for Telekinetic Grab <:telekeneticgrab:866551637970255872> to collect the drops along with using a legendary pet with the "Scavenge" perk active.
