> **Introduction** 
As a very old boss, Kalphite Queen is relatively unrewarding and relatively simple. Typically only done for pet or collection log, there is no further reason for a high level account to do this boss. The only notable mechanic is her form change. She will spawn into the instance immune to range and magic, and therefore must be melee'd. After the first 40k damage is dealt, she will change forms to her flying form, which is immune to melee. Simply bring two styles, and DPS both forms of the queen down.

Slayer helmet boosts work when on a Kalphites task.

**AFK Preset (~37 kph)**
This method is slower than the active hybrid methods, but it requires little to no input. Verac the Defiled’s set effect along with weapon poison and a ripper demon with scrolls effectively kills kalphite queen’s second phase in a timely manner. Elder overload salve, penance aura, and elven ritual shard activation will sustain <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and <:turmoil:583429936606347280> use indefinitely. No active pocket slot is necessary.
