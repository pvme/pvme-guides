.tag:intro
Generally, Barrows is only camped by high level players in an effort to obtain the Graverobber title. Since the brothers are relatively weak, <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is used to avoid the need for solid food. Additionally, having obtained Morytania Legs 3+ is useful and increases loot obtained. A Drakan's Medallion is used to initially teleport to the Barrows, as high level players are able to camp the boss for hours on end, reducing the need to retune your boss portal.

__**The order the brothers 👬 should 👑 be killed 😫😫 in**__ 👏🍆
Dharok → Guthan → Verac → Akrisae → Ahrim → Linza → Karil → Torag

.
__**Strategy**__
⬥ Use 👏 your 💼👊 amulet on Akrisae, and 💰 on 🔛🏽 the ➡🗣 2/3 bottom ⬇ crypts.
⬥ If ☝❗ you are using an 👹 Inquisitor staff, use 🖐 your 👩 amulets on 🔛 Ahrim and 👨☝ Karil.
⬥ If 👏 any brother is 💢👅 in the 👏 tunnels instead 👍 of their ⬅👈 crypt you 👦☝ can 🔫🙅 use 👏 the 🅱⤴ amulet on the 🏠 loot chest 📦😌 for the same 💁😯 function.
⬥ If 🏼 you 🗣🙋 encounter Akrisae in the 😫 tunnels, he 👉🤠 can 💦🔫 be 🐝😌 one ☝😉 shot before he's able 💪💪 to ➡👏 prayer 📢🚨 switch by 😈 doing 📌😉 the 💦 following:
    • **Mage:** <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:deto:535533833358016512> + <:wm:535533809978966037>
    • **Melee:** Auto + <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:smash:535532879820619786> → <:cane:535532878969438210>

.
__**General Tips**__
As 🅰🍑 a 😍 low ⬇ level boss, 💼 Barrows will 😡 scale to 💦💦 the 👨🤔 level 🎚👌 of effort 🏋 willing to be put 😏🔫 in. For example, 🔥🔥 it 💯 is 👉 possible 🔝🔝 to 😩 4taa the brothers, 👬👬 and 👏 use 📱👏 dw/2h switching 🔥🔥 in order 📑 to 💦 clear 📝 them 🍑👬 quickly. However, 💰 it is 🅱💦 also reasonable to 💰 bring ➡⬅ less ➖👎 switches and instead 💴 take a 🅰 more 🍗😒 relaxed approach, using 📤 legacy to 🅱✂ AFK the 🚟🌈 brothers 👬 or 💰➕ revolution to ⬇ clear 📝 them, 💭😉 only 👏 having 👉 to 😅😳 switch styles on 🔛💦 Akrisae in response 🎉🎉 to 💦 his prayers.
