> **__Introduction__**
As with many low tier bosses, KBD is only camped for title and pet. To this end, it is generally most effective to AFK the boss, and reserve any active gameplay time for more interesting bosses. To this end, an AFK preset is provided. It is encouraged to use either Legacy or the Revolution bar provided below:

.
> **__Drops__**
⬥ <:kbdhead:643163046969212946>  **KBD Head** `1/128`
⬥ <:kbdscale:643163047275266094>  **KBD Scale** `1/2500 (500 threshold)`

.
> **__Preset__**
The preset takes advantage of elder overload salves, which provide an antifire effect, to reduce most damage taken in a fight with KBD. An excalibur is used for any health upkeep that might be needed (this should not be a problem with soul split, however). A demonhorn necklace can optionally be used in conjunction with a bonecrusher, to allow for prayer upkeep based on the bones of KBD. The use of potion reservoirs allow for 36 minute AFK times, resulting in only needing to make sure the player isn't lobbied.

It is highly recommended to use the dragon slayer perk. A slayer helmet can be used if on task, either worn or in slayer lodge.  The Dragon bane 2h sword is BiS at KBD though it cannot be resold and should be considered optional.

⬥ <:adrenurn:656426717413507074>  **Adrenaline urn** `Prevents adren loss after dropping combat, stores up to 1000% adrenaline`
⬥ <:ancientshard:656426717505650708>  **Ancient elven ritual shard** `Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown`
⬥ <:potionreservoir:878739200407654431>  **Potion reservoir** `Can store up to 6 doses of a potion, such as an overload, and automatically refresh that potion when its duration is low. Only one may be filled at a time, so you must manually fill a new reservoir when your current one depletes.`
