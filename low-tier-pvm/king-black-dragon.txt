> **__Introduction__** 
As 😎 with 👏🅱 many 👨💪 low 👏⬇ tier 👑👑 bosses, KBD is 💦💦 only camped for 💰🔯 title 🤔🤔 and ⬆🏽 pet. 🐩 To ♀ this 🎊 end, it is generally 😄 most 🔝🤚 effective to 💰💦 AFK the boss, 💼🏽 and reserve any 🎉 active ☢☢ gameplay time ⌛👌 for 🔜🍆 more interesting 🤔🤔 bosses. To 💦 this 👉 end, 🔚😂 an 😲 AFK preset is provided. It is encouraged to 💦 use 👏✊ either 🚫🤷 Legacy or 😛 a 🅰🌀 Revolution++ Bar, 🥃 as 😴 provided on the 👏❄ Runescape Wiki:

⬥ <:kbdhead:643163046969212946>  **KBD Head** `1/128`

> **__Preset__**
The 🏻 preset takes 💜💜 advantage of elder overload salves, which 👏 provide an 💸 antifire effect, 📣 to reduce most damage ☠ taken 🚀 in 🏠👏 a 💯🎟 fight with 👏👏 KBD. An 😚 excalibur is 💦🕤 used for 🎅 any 🅱 health 💉 upkeep that might ⚰🤔 be 🏿 needed 🤒🤒 (this should 👫👶 not 🚫 be 💗 a 💰🤧 problem with 👏 soul 😱😱 split, however). A 📸🗣 demonhorn necklace 💍💍 can 💁 optionally be used 🏭 in 👇 conjunction with a 🔥 bonecrusher, to allow for 🍆👏 prayer upkeep based on the 👏😄 bones 🍆🍆 of 💦 KBD. The 💦💦 use of potion 🍾🍾 reservoirs allow ☁🎫 for 36 minute ⌚⏰ AFK times, resulting in 👏💦 only 😠 needing to make 🖕📝 sure the 😱⚕ player 💰🤷 isn't lobbied.

It ❗💯 is ❤ highly 💨💨 recommended to ➡💯 use the ⏰💦 dragon 🐲🐲 slayer 💦 perk. ⏫ A 👌⛄ slayer 🍆 helmet can 💦💸 be 💨🐝 used 🎶🎶 if 🍆👉 on 🏿 task, 🚜 either 🤷 worn or 💁 in 🏠 slayer lodge.  The Dragon bane 2h sword 🗡🗡 is BiS 💍💍 at KBD though 💭 it cannot ❗😡 be resold and 😩 should be 👄👬 considered 🤔 optional.
