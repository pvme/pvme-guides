.tag:intro
Another old boss, only camped for pet and title. Giant mole is very straightforward, only requiring the ability to do damage. The only relevant mechanic present is her dig, where she will dig to a different part of the arena, indicated by a dirt arrow on the ground. Falador Hard and Elite diaries provide buffs to the rewards from mole, but these are minimal, and not required for camping the boss. <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> can be used to mitigate any damage done by the Mole.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method is only about 90-95% reliable for AFKing per kill.
⬥ If the boss digs in the middle of a channeled ability, your character will still aggro the boss and chase it down.
⬥ Sometimes the AFK can break if any of the following happens:
    • The player is trapped under a wave of mud at the same time the boss phases.
    • The boss phases while you're not channeling an ability.
    • On rare occasion the minions can steal aggro.
⬥ You will have to target the boss at the start of every kill
    • She will not aggro to you automatically, even with Aggression potion
⬥ Turning game sounds on will help you realize when the method breaks.
