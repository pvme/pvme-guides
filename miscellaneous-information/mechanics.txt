**__Keybind NPC Targetting__**
Targeting settings can be found under the Combat Tab in the Settings Interface and includes the situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds. This function allows you to select a target procedurally based on whether you set the targeting mode to Radial or Conal. It is very useful for improving consistency and speed in nearly all boss encounters. A notable advantage of cycle target is that Detonate will not be cancelled upon use.

⬥ **Radial targeting:** Cycles from the nearest to the farthest target from the player when pressed. In the case of multiple equidistant targets, it will cycle clockwise starting from the north. This is useful for simply snapping to the closest target available.

⬥ **Conal Targeting:** Cycles from the closest to the farthest target in the direction the camera is facing. The angle for an NPC to be considered eligible for selection is around 75-90°. This is most useful for more precise targeting in scenarios with multiple NPCs around.

__**Notable Applications**__
⬥ **The Shadow Reef**
    • Tagging Sinister Fragments at the Ambassador, saves 4 ticks.

.
⬥ **Vorago**
    • Gaining aggro on p2 dropdown. This can solve the 1 HP P1 issue where P2 starts off with random aggro.
    • Tagging Teamsplit on drop to Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Teamsplit.
    • The timing for P5 Teamsplit is 17 ticks from when you can crack heal.
https://youtu.be/9YejOAvquQk
.
.
⬥ **Nex: Angel of Death**
    • Radial targeting to tag P2 Amalgamations when Detonating <:deto:535533833358016512>. This allows to tag on spawn without risking cancelling detonate accidentally.
    • Tagging Pillars on P4, prevents possible misclicks with the camera snapping over after using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>.

.
⬥ **Solak**
    • Tagging the Blight Afflicted Core on spawn, potentially saves a tick which helps a bit for one-cycling.
    • Tagging Arms and Legs faster.

.
⬥ **GWD2**
    • The bosses with long spawn animations can be tagged immediately, which helps particularly on Helwyr.

*Note: When attempting to cycle to a target on spawn, spam clicking the keybind will not work so you just have to know the exact tick it becomes targetable. Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick.*

.tag:walking
**__Moving NPCs__**
⬥ In RS, bosses only walk East, West, or South (never North). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards.

.
⬥ Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways: an east-walking boss will turn west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and a south-walking boss will turn either east or west. The Araxxor Walking Guide demonstrates this behavior:
.
https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k
.
**__Applications__**
⬥ The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>. Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>):
.
https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI
.
*Note: A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to go under the boss and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD.*

.
⬥ Walking can also be used to reposition a boss, such as fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams.

.
*Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don’t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.*

.tag:manualspellcasting
.
**__Saving Rune Costs__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/e678FYp.png
.
⬥ Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, Blitz <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>, and Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier.
    • Particularly, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects.

.
⬥ However, this issue is resolved with manual spell casting found in the combat settings. This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell.
⬥ Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and they use Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659>, their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90.
    • With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs.
        - This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with.

.
__**Applications**__
⬥ On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1.

⬥ On Ancients, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell.
    • Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster.
    • Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% on a personal basis, potentially allowing some use in a solo pvm situation.

⬥ Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> under manual spell casting.

⬥ At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so.
    • Binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off.
    • With the toggle on, the player has increased control over when to bind Telos and potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence.

.tag:centre
**__Boss Center Square is Always South-West__**
⬥ This affects abilities like Corruption blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>.
On something like a combat dummy, the true centre is in the centre because the size of the dummy is 1 square, but any monster 2 by 2 or larger has a south-west centre.

.
⬥ In picture A, the Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> green arrows are on the centre of the Dragon, meaning the Dragon to the North will not be hit by the ability.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/cPreXnV.png
.
⬥ In picture B, the arrows are perfectly aligned and will allow detonate to hit both Dragons. This means you should always try to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit.
.

⬥ Here is a general diagram showcasing the above visuals in the context of a 3x3 AoE being used:
.

.tag:sgbspec
**__Reliance on Arrow 1__**
⬥ Arrows 2-5+ scale their random damage (and so max hit) based on the minimum hit of Arrow 1 after Precise perk <:p6:712073088769982475> is applied (i.e., after calculating most the damage) using a diminishing multiplier on it. Equilibrium perk <:eq4:712073088589627505> is applied as normal.
    • The diminishing multiplier is as follows:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/hwUELED.png
.
⬥ Ammunition with secondary effects, such as Blackstone Arrows <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617>, also only proc/apply on Arrow 1

.
**__Where Arrows 2-5 can Land__**
1) Determine NPC's center
    a) True center for odd sizes
    b) SW of the middle 2x2 area for even sizes

2) Choose random tile within floor(Size/2) from the center
     a) It must be possible for the player to walk from this tile to the NPC's centre

3) Choose 4 random tiles in a 2 tile radius from the above tile
    a) If an arrow chooses to land on a tile already chosen by a previous arrow, it will reroll its choice up to 10 times

*Note: Diagram from Mod Pi visualizing this:*
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/OOMssns.png
.
**__What Blocking Is__**
⬥ A mob being blocking essentially means that the mob prevents the player from going on a tile they occupy

⬥ So, if you recall from step 2a for determining where arrows land, this would mean it is not possible for the player to walk from these tiles to the NPC's centre
    • As a result, the centre chosen for step 3 will simply be the centre tile determined in step 1
        - Therefore, all arrows will land within a 2x2 radius from there, hence why 5x5 NPCs have a 100% chance at 5 arrows

.
**__Practical Applications of This Info__**
Assuming best in slot gear, average damage will be as follows:
```
On/Off-style (average arrows):
3x3: 14.7k/11.5k (2.44)
5x5: 21k/16k (3.31)
5x5 blocking: 30k/23.7k (5)
```
So, SGB is only worth using on-style for 3x3+, and off-style for 5x5+

.
**__Multiple SGBs Hitting A Single Target__**
Each spec that hits within 2 ticks will get a normal Arrow 1 hit. Arrows 2-5 can hit as normal and any arrows beyond those will continue to scale down linearly until their max hit is the same as their min hit.

.
**__Crit Interactions of Arrows 2-5__** <:reaverring:839903943018283050>
Crit chance for these is updated when they are "cast," i.e., after Arrow1 hits/3t after SGB cast.

.
**__IoTH Interactions__** <:ingen:641339234111848463>
Normally when you SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if Arrow 1 hits, then remaining will not splash.
⬥ So, you can IoTH SGB <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:sgb:626466665848242186>, as it will make Arrow 1 hit, thus 2-5 will not splash

.
***The following are only applicable to SGB EoF*** <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofblue:780401412906680330>

.
**__Chin SGB Interactions:__** <:mechchin:641669268722810881>
⬥ It acts as if you have SGBed N times, once per target affected by the Chin effect

.
**__Bakriminel Bolt Interactions:__** <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
⬥ These are determined on cast, and as mentioned only Arrow 1 can proc them
    • Also, if it affects Arrow 1's hit directly (e.g., Ruby <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> / Onyx <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>) it will also affect Arrows 2-5 as described earlier

> **__How Adren Gaining Without a Target Works__ (Courtesy of <@236955913859104778>)**
.tag:adrengain
**__Stalling Adrenaline__**
⬥ After doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds. After that, defensive basics will no longer give adren.
    • There is an important caveat: you will only be unable to gain adren for 10 seconds. After that, you can use ONE defensive basic that will give you adren, after which you will be unable to gain adren again for 10s. Think of this as a cooldown - 10s after the last damaging ability on a boss, you will only be able to build once every 10s. The following abilities do not affect or reset this “cooldown”:
        - Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escapecodex:602561894443778115>, and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>)
        - Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD)
        - Ultimates that do not require a target

⬥ An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> + a defensive basic that was used NO earlier than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren.
    • You would be able to use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> to stall, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> when your Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> has run out.

.
*Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi and Telos)*

.tag:poison
**__How it Works__**
⬥ Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used.
    • While this is active, players have a 12.5% chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune.
    • After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes.
    • Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it.

⬥ Damage is derived in the following manner:
    • Poison damage starts with a base value of 20% of the player's ability damage, base Weapon Poison representing 100% of this damage.
    • Each tier of poison adds +25% to this value. Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> will also provide an additional 25%.
    • Damage is rolled between 65-130% of this final poison damage value.
    • Unless refreshed, the damage range will be reduced by 3% on every subsequent hit (63.5-127%, 62-124%, etc.)
    • Final Damage Ranges:
        - Weapon Poison    = 13.00-26.00%
        - Weapon Poison+   = 16.25-32.50%
        - Weapon Poison++  = 19.50-39.00%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 22.75-45.50%
        - Cinderbanes+++   = 26.00-52.00%
    • Average Damage Values:
        - Weapon Poison    = 19.50%
        - Weapon Poison+   = 24.36%
        - Weapon Poison++  = 29.25%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 34.13%
        - Cinderbanes+++   = 39.00%

⬥ Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>, Kwuarm Incense Sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>, and Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> increase poison damage values, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not.

.
⬥ **Cinderbane Gloves** <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>:
    • While worn, the gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, allowing for a 12.5% chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target.
    • This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset.
    • This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat has a 12.5% chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer.
        - With this considered, the effective application rate per hitsplat is ~14.3%
    • Even without consuming Weapon Poison, the gloves will apply poison damage as if Weapon Poison+ was in effect.

.
⬥ **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>:
    • Per potency level, Kwuarm Incense Sticks will add a multiplicative damage increase of 2.5% to the player's final poison damage.
    • At maximum potency, this is a multiplicative 10% to poison damage. This brings the range of Weapon Poison+++ with Cinderbane Gloves worn to 28.60-57.52%, or an average of 42.9% ability damage.

.
⬥ **Laniakea's Spear** <:lanispear:839903893177106454>:
    • The application rate of poison is boosted by an additive 5%, increasing it to 17.5%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~21.2%, up from ~14.3%.
    • Poison damage is increased by a multiplicative 5%, similar to Kwuarm Incense Sticks.

.
⬥ **Upgraded Bone Blowpipe**:
    • Poison damage is halved, but the application rate is doubled to 25%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~33.3%, up from ~14.3%.

.
⬥ **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>:
    • Applies its own "poison" damage separate from normal weapon poison.
        - 50% chance on hit to apply a stacking damage over time effect.
        - Hits every 2 ticks after application, up to 5 hits unless refreshed before the final hit.
        - When refreshed, the damage will increase and hit another 5 times.
        - Damage starts with a range of 10-24 per hit, and can climb up to 125-249 per hit.
    • While this weapon doesn't directly influence the base damage or application rate of poison, the passive effect hits very rapidly and consistently. This allows for more poison hits to occur.

.
⬥ Poison can be applied/refreshed by **any player-sourced damage**. This includes:
    • Abilities (Includes every hit from bleeds/damage over time, including Sunshine & Death's Swiftness)
    • Auras (Ancestor Spirits & Dark Magic)
    • Auto attacks
    • Bakriminel/Enchanted Bolt extra hits (Emerald & Dragonstone)
    • Blood necklaces
    • Blood Reaver passive
    • Cannon damage
    • Dominion mines
    • Eldritch Crossbow special
    • God books
    • Poison damage
    • Puncture bleeds
    • Reflect damage
    • Wyvern Crossbow passive

> **__Zerk Auras and On-Cast Ult Interactions__ (Courtesy of <@781280949790572554>)**
.tag:zerkAura
Normally throughout your Sunshine, Death's Swiftness, and Berserk, the 10% damage increase from your Maniacal, Reckless, and Berserker Auras do not come into effect. However, there is a caveat in which you can get *both* the Ultimate boost and Aura boost, which is colloquially referred to as "last tick of ult."

.
⬥ Since the listed ultimates apply their buff on cast while the listed auras apply their buff on hit, by simply casting an ability in your ultimate and it hitting after the ultimate lets it get buffed by the 10% from aura too since the ultimate is now over and the buff can be applied.

.
⬥ Notice the following image: the same ability is cast, yet one hit significantly harder, that is because of this interaction
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0TxDCjz.png
.
⬥ It is also important to take caution when using queuing, for if you queue something, this will not work.
    • This can cause issues when trying to cast an ability on the final tick of an ultimate to get the ultimate and aura damage modifiers stacking, as it makes your ability not stack with the final tick of your ultimate.

    • As can be seen, despite no ticks being lost, the <:backhand:535532854302605333> at the start of <:zerk:535532854004678657> dealt 3977 but the one on the final tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657> dealt 2185 as it was actually casted out of <:zerk:535532854004678657> due to this interaction.
    • The solution to it as follows:
        - Firstly, you can just not queue an ability that will be casted on the last tick of your ultimate
        - Secondly, you can turn queuing off

.tag:hex
**__What Is a Hex Modifier__**
This refers to the passive effect of the Hexhunter bow <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, Terrasaur maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, and Inquisitor staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>. The modifier is commonly just called "Hex" because the <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> was the first weapon released with this effect.

.
**__What Is the Passive Effect__**
When active, it provides +12.5% ability damage and +10% hit chance. This damage increase applies to all abilities and auto attacks, but not to poison, Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009>, or Crackling <:crack4:712073087662686249> procs. The hit chance increase is a flat +10% over typical T80 weapon hit chance values before the effects of DBA <:DBA:603979368850653216> and Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> are considered.

.
**__When is the Effect Active__**
To receive the buffs, you must be against a target whose main attack style is weak to your weapon's style (based on the combat triangle). If you don't see a debuff icon under your target's health bar indicating it is susceptible to your weapon, you are effectively using a normal T80 weapon.

.
**__What Does This all Mean__**
Where the effect works you can expect to see a ~4.8%/3.4%/1.4% damage increase over T90/T92/T95 weapons, provided you aren't losing any hit chance due to the lower accuracy tier. It is a common misconception that the weapons have T97 damage and accuracy, this is only a theoretical effective tier for their damage and is only true with sufficient level boosts and equipment bonuses. The hit chance is typically slightly above that of a T90 weapon, but because it is a flat hit chance increase, this scales up as the target's armour increases.

> **__Grimoire and Scrimshaw Switching__**
.tag:grimshaw
**__Obtaining both pocket slot's benefits__**
Due to the fact that damage critical hits are calculated as an ability is fired, but modifiers like scrimshaw are calculated when an ability hits, it is possible to obtain the boosts of Erethdor's Grimoire at the same time as a Scrimshaw. This can result in roughly a 6% increase in damage across the course of an entire rotation, but will significantly increase the amount of inputs.

⬥ Inputs for grimshaw with 4taa, in order (bracket groups indicate inputs in a single tick):

[Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Staff Equipped <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>] → [ <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> → Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031>]

[Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + DW Equipped <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>] → [Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Equip Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>]

> **__Instance Hopping__ (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>)**
.tag:inshopp
**__Why is it Useful__**
⬥ Some boss encounters, such as the whole God Wars Dungeon 2, take place inside an private instance. Although useful to prevent world crowding from annoying you in PvM, there is a downside: Bosses will not respawn instantly inside it.
    • There is a method used to reduce the spawn time of the bosses, and it consists of: kill boss → pick loot if worth it → quickly leave instance → re-join instance → repeat

Comparison of waiting for spawn time x instance hopping: https://youtu.be/O-Lb93vFRAI
.
*Note: Although the difference might seem small, over the course of multiple (30+ kills) it adds up significantly.*

.tag:shake
**__Camera Toggles__**
⬥ If you suffer from motion sickness, you may toggle this off in the settings menu. This is particularly useful for Rise of the Six tunnels, or usage of Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>.

⬥ However be aware that camera shake often helps indicate a mechanic is about to happen, for example at Solak or Black Stone Dragon.
