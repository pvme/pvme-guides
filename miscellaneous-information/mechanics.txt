**__Keybind NPC Targetting__**
⬥ Targeting settings can be found under the Combat Tab in the Settings Interface and includes the situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Apqq3Th.png
.
⬥ This function allows you to select a target procedurally based on whether you set the targeting mode to Radial or Conal.

⬥ **Radial targeting:**
    • Cycles from the nearest to the farthest target from the player when pressed.
    • In the case of multiple equidistant targets, it will cycle clockwise starting from the north.
    • This is useful for simply snapping to the closest target available.

⬥ **Conal Targeting:**
    • Cycles from the closest to the farthest target in the direction the camera is facing.
    • The angle for an NPC to be considered eligible for selection is around 75-90°.
    • This is most useful for more precise targeting in scenarios with multiple NPCs around.

.
**__Why it is Useful__**
⬥ It is very useful for improving consistency and speed in nearly all boss encounters.
⬥ A notable advantage of target cycle is that Detonate is not cancelled upon selecting a new target before release.
    • Without target cycle if you wished to do this you would have to click and release on same tick to not lose Detonate

.
__**Notable Applications**__
⬥ **The Shadow Reef**
        - Tagging Sinister Fragments at the Ambassador, saves 4 ticks.

.
⬥ **Vorago**
    • Gaining aggro on p2 dropdown. This can solve the 1 HP P1 issue where P2 starts off with random aggro.
    • Tagging Teamsplit on drop to Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Teamsplit.
    • The timing for P3/P5 is 17 ticks from when you can crack heal:

https://youtu.be/9YejOAvquQk
.
⬥ **Nex: Angel of Death**
    • Radial targeting to tag P2 Amalgamations when Detonating <:deto:535533833358016512>. This allows to tag on spawn without risking cancelling detonate accidentally.
    • Tagging Pillars on P4, prevents possible misclicks with the camera snapping over after using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>.

⬥ **Solak**
    • Tagging the Blight Afflicted Core on spawn, potentially saves a tick which helps a bit for one-cycling.
    • Tagging Arms and Legs faster.

⬥ **GWD2**
    • The bosses with long spawn animations can be tagged immediately, which helps particularly on Helwyr.

⬥ When attempting to cycle to a target on spawn, spam clicking the keybind will not work so you just have to know the exact tick it becomes targetable.
    • Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick.

> **__Solo Flanking__(Courtesy of <@110810140445294592>)**
.tag:soloflanking
⬥ In this section, different use cases of solo Flanking will be explained.

⬥ **Case 1.0**: Target is stuck in position.
    • Target must be unable to move, not just their animation but actual position in the server.
    • Moving under or behind are the easiest flanking spots to reach.
    • Examples:
        - Black Stone Dragon while casting Smoke Spiral.
        - Taraket the Necromancer during the last phase as he casts Spirit Line.

⬥ **Case 1.5**: Target is stuck but the player is unable to reach behind the target.
    • This condition applies to certain bosses and mobs.
    • They might be casting an AoE mechanic that originates from their center.
    • Simply prepare ahead of time and step 1 tile away from any of the cardinal directions.
    • Once the target locks their position, move 1 tile towards the same cardinal direction and activate your flanking ability.
    • Below is an example of Raksha's tail swipe mechanic. Notice the last ability used was Impact within Sunshine buff:
.
.img:https://imgur.com/G1zlwXH.mp4
.
⬥ **Case 2**: Walking under an immovable and non-blocked target:
    • Taraket the Necromancer in his Ranged form.
    • Kerapac, while he is casting Shatter ability, upon landing from Jumping Slam, during casting Lightning Strike, and in his phase transitions (SS heal).
    • Any boss or monster that is rooted from Ice Barrage or Sticky Bombs can be walked under for flanking.
    • The Ambassador at all times:
.
.img:https://imgur.com/FMhz1Cm.mp4
.
⬥ **Case 3**: Target that are size 2x2 can always be flanked on two of their adjacent tiles.
    • Applicable bosses: Commander Zilyanna, Gregovic.
    • Applicable monsters: Sea Horrors, Scopulus, Ripper Demons, Nightmare Creatures, Igneous Tzekhaar-Xil, Igneous Tzekhaar-Hur.
    • Below is a picture of the 2 tiles where flanking will always work as well as an example of Igneous Tzkhaar-Hur:

> **__Walking Bosses__ (Courtesy of <@236955913859104778>)**
.tag:walking
**__Moving NPCs__**
⬥ In RS, bosses only walk East, West, or South (never North). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards.
⬥ Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways:
    • East-walking boss will turn west
    • West-walking boss will turn south
    • South-walking boss will turn either east or west.
    • The Araxxor Walking Guide demonstrates this behavior:
.
https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k
.
**__Applications__**
⬥ The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.
    • Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>):
.
https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI
.
⬥ Advanced version: Use a bleed and then immediately Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to go under the boss and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get back all within a GCD.
    • This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD.
⬥ Reposition a boss: Fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams.
⬥ Most bosses move at 2 squares per tick, just like players' characters.
    • Bosses that you don’t want to walk, should be moved an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.

.tag:manualspellcasting
**__Where to Find it__**
⬥ Manual spell casting toggle can be found in the combat settings:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/e678FYp.png
.
**__What it Does and Why it is Useful__**
⬥ Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to.
    • The Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659>, and Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> spells deal damage scaling up to T99 while other spells are capped at a lower tier.

⬥ Enabling manual spell casting makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell.

⬥ Without manual spell casting enabled, Using Ice blitz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883>, while autocast is set to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, results in Ice Biltz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> becoming the autocast, which is capped at T92 damage
    • With manual spell casting toggled on, the autocast spell remains Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>:
        - Holds damage done to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> damage even if a lower damaging spell is casted.
        - This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with.
        - This is useful for players that are using the Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451> as otherwise the damage is reduced from T95 to T92.

.
⬥ On the normal spellbook, the player can manually cast Air Strike <:airstrike:895600427930910730> instead of Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, reducing Air rune costs by 4 per cast.

⬥ On Ancient spellbook, Aurora spells can be manually cast to benefit yourself or your teammates:
    • Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> can increase the damage of teammates by upto 3%.
    • Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% to yourself only.
    • Blood Burst <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> for the same damage and effect as Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> but a lower cost.

⬥ At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so.
    • Stops poorly timed binding of Telos or breaking his freedom too early by having control on when you want to freeze.
    • Potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence.

.tag:centre
**__NPC Centre and NPC Coordinate__**
⬥ For all NPCs, there's two Attributes used as the center of the NPC:
    • NPC Centre: This differs depends on the size of NPC.
        - Odd-sized (1x1, 3x3, 5x5...): This will always be the centre tile.
        - Even-Sized (2x2, 4x4, 6x6...): This will always be the first SW tile in that NPC's middle region.
    • NPC Coordinate: This will always be the most SW tile of that NPC.

.tag:sgbspec
**__Reliance on Arrow 1__**
⬥ Arrows 2-5+ scale their random damage as follows:
    • Based on the minimum hit of Arrow 1 after Precise perk <:p6:712073088769982475> is applied.
        - I.e., after calculating most the damage using a diminishing multiplier on it.
    • Equilibrium perk <:eq4:712073088589627505> is applied as normal.
    • The diminishing multiplier is as follows:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/hwUELED.png
.
⬥ Ammunition with secondary effects, such as Blackstone arrows <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617>, also only proc/apply on Arrow 1.
    • Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> will apply for each calculated critical hit.

.
**__Where Arrows 2-5 can Land__**
1) Determine NPC's center
    a) The actual centre tile for odd sizes
    b) SW tile of the middle 2x2 area for even sizes

2) Choose a random tile that is: Floor(Size / 2) away from NPC centre.
    a) This will be the center tile of the SGB Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> arrow landing zone.
    b) It must be possible for the player to walk from this tile to the NPC's centre.
        - If the player can not walk from any of the tiles chosen randomly to the NPC centre, then the NPC Centre is used as a default.

3) Choose 4 random tiles in a 2 tile radius from the above tile
    • If an arrow chooses to land on a tile already chosen by a previous arrow, it will reroll its choice up to 10 times.

.
⬥ Diagram from Mod Pi visualizing this:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/OOMssns.png
.
**__What Blocking Is__**
⬥ A blocked NPC is an NPC where the player is unable to reach the NPC centre tile.

⬥ The area covered by the SGB Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> is as shown above is a 5x5 area.

⬥ So, NPCs size 5x5 or bigger and are blocked will have all subsequent arrows land 100% of the time if the first arrows lands.
.
**__Practical Applications of This Info__**
⬥ Assuming best in slot gear, average damage will be as follows:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Us84iTb.png
.
⬥ SGB is only worth using on-style for 3x3+, and off-style for 5x5+

⬥ Multi SGB Hits:
    • Each spec that hits within 2 ticks will get a normal Arrow 1 hit.
        - Arrows 2-5 can hit as normal and any arrows beyond those will continue to scale down linearly until their max hit is the same as their min hit.

⬥ Crit chance for these is updated when they are "cast," i.e., after Arrow 1 hits/3t after SGB cast.

⬥ Ingenutiy of the Humans <:ingen:641339234111848463>  makes Arrow 1 hit with 100% accuracy, so the remaining arrows can not splash.
    • This is because normally if you <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if Arrow 1 hits, Arrows 2-5 do not splash

.
**__SGB EoF interactions__** <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofblue:780401412906680330>
⬥ **Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> SGB:**
    • Acts as if you have SGBed N times, once per target affected by the Chin effect.
⬥  **Bakriminel bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> SGB:**
    • As mentioned, these are determined on cast, so only Arrow 1 can proc them
        - But if it affects Arrow 1's hit directly (e.g., Ruby <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> / Onyx <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>) it will also affect Arrows 2-5's damage as described earlier

.tag:adrengain
**__Stalling Adrenaline__**
⬥ After doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds.

⬥ After 10 seconds, you will only be able to gain adren for 1 defensive basic for every 10 seconds.

⬥ The following abilities do not affect or reset this “cooldown”:
    • Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escapecodex:602561894443778115>, and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>)
    • Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD)
    • Ultimates that do not require a target.

.tag:poison
**__How it Works__**
⬥ Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used.
    • While this is active, players have a 12.5% chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune.
    • After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes.
    • Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it.

⬥ Damage is derived in the following manner:
    • Poison damage starts with a base value of 20% of the player's ability damage, base Weapon Poison representing 100% of this damage.
    • Each tier of poison adds +25% to this value. Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> will also provide an additional 25%.
    • Damage is rolled between 65-130% of this final poison damage value.
    • Unless refreshed, the damage range will be reduced by 3% on every subsequent hit (63.5-127%, 62-124%, etc.)
    • Final Damage Ranges:
        - Weapon Poison    = 13.00-26.00%
        - Weapon Poison+   = 16.25-32.50%
        - Weapon Poison++  = 19.50-39.00%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 22.75-45.50%
        - Cinderbanes+++   = 26.00-52.00%
    • Average Damage Values:
        - Weapon Poison    = 19.50%
        - Weapon Poison+   = 24.36%
        - Weapon Poison++  = 29.25%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 34.13%
        - Cinderbanes+++   = 39.00%

⬥ Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>, Kwuarm Incense Sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>, and Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> increase poison damage values, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not.

.
⬥ **Cinderbane Gloves** <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>:
    • The gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, 12.5% chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target.
    • This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset.
    • This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat has a 12.5% chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer.
        - With this considered, the effective application rate per hitsplat is ~14.3%
    • Even without consuming Weapon Poison, the gloves will apply poison damage as if Weapon Poison+ was in effect.

.
⬥ **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>:
    • Per potency level, Kwuarm Incense Sticks will add a multiplicative damage increase of 2.5% to the player's final poison damage.
    • At maximum potency, this is a multiplicative 10% to poison damage.
    • This brings the range of Weapon Poison+++ with Cinderbane Gloves worn to 28.60-57.52%, or an average of 42.9% ability damage.

.
⬥ **Laniakea's Spear** <:lanispear:839903893177106454>:
    • The application rate of poison is boosted by an additive 5%, increasing it to 17.5%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~21.2%, up from ~14.3%.
    • Poison damage is increased by a multiplicative 5%, similar to Kwuarm Incense Sticks.

.
⬥ **Upgraded Bone Blowpipe**:
    • Poison damage is halved, but the application rate is doubled to 25%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~33.3%, up from ~14.3%.

.
⬥ **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>:
    • Applies its own "poison" damage separate from normal weapon poison.
        - 50% chance on hit to apply a stacking damage over time effect.
        - Hits every 2 ticks after application, up to 5 hits unless refreshed before the final hit.
        - When refreshed, the damage will increase and hit another 5 times.
        - Damage starts with a range of 10-24 per hit, and can climb up to 125-249 per hit.
    • While this weapon doesn't directly influence the base damage or application rate of poison, the passive effect hits very rapidly and consistently.
    • This allows for more chances for poison hits to occur.

.
⬥ Poison can be applied/refreshed by **any player-sourced damage**. This includes:
    • Abilities (Includes every hit from bleeds/damage over time, including Sunshine & Death's Swiftness)
    • Auras (Ancestor Spirits & Dark Magic)
    • Auto attacks
    • Bakriminel/Enchanted Bolt extra hits (Emerald & Dragonstone)
    • Blood necklaces
    • Blood Reaver passive
    • Cannon damage
    • Dominion mines
    • Eldritch Crossbow special
    • God books
    • Poison damage

⬥ Sunshine, Death's Swiftness, and Berserk apply on yourself when you cast the ability.
⬥ Maniacal, Berserker, and Reckless auras apply on-hit.
⬥ The ability(s) and/or hit(s) initiated on the last tick of an ultimate ability boosting your damage will also benefit from the Auras mentioned above.
⬥ Notice the following image: the same ability is cast, yet one hit significantly harder, that is because of this interaction.

⬥ The ability rotation being done is: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:barge:535532853916860437> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → (4-hit) <:destroy:535532879330148352> → (3-hit) <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333>
    • Clearly the last flank Backhand did not go off inside your berserk even though it was queued at that point.
    • To resolve this either do not queue the ability that will be casted on the last tick of your ultimate, or turn of ability queueing

.tag:hex
**__What Is a Hex Modifier__**
⬥ This refers to the passive effect of the Hexhunter bow <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, Terrasaur maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, and Inquisitor staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>.
    • The modifier is commonly just called "Hex" because the <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> was the first weapon released with this effect.

.
**__What Is the Passive Effect__**
⬥ When active, it provides +12.5% ability damage and +10% hit chance.

⬥ This damage increase applies to all abilities and auto attacks, but not to poison, Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009>, or Crackling <:crack4:712073087662686249> procs.

⬥ The hit chance increase is a flat +10% over typical T80 weapon hit chance values before the effects of DBA <:DBA:603979368850653216> and Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> are considered.

.
**__When is the Effect Active__**
⬥ To receive the buffs, you must be against a target whose main attack style is weak to your weapon's style (based on the combat triangle).

⬥ If you don't see a debuff icon under your target's health bar indicating it is susceptible to your weapon, you are effectively using a normal T80 weapon.

.
**__What Does This all Mean__**
⬥ Expect to see a ~4.8%/3.4%/1.4% damage increase over T90/T92/T95 weapons, provided you aren't losing any hits due to the lower accuracy.

⬥ It is a common misconception that the weapons have T97 damage and accuracy

⬥ This is only a theoretical effective tier for their damage and is only true with sufficient level boosts and equipment bonuses.

⬥ The hit chance is typically slightly above that of a T90 weapon, but because it is a flat hit chance increase, this scales up as the target's armour increases.

> **__Grimoire and Scrimshaw Switching__**
.tag:grimshaw
**__Obtaining both pocket slot's benefits__**
⬥ It is possible to obtain the boosts of Erethdor's Grimoire at the same time as a Scrimshaw.

⬥ This can result in roughly a 6% increase in damage across the course of an entire rotation, but will significantly increase the amount of inputs.

⬥ This happens because critical hits are rolled on cast, while modifiers like scrimshaws are calculated on hit.

⬥ Inputs for grimshaw with 4taa, in order (bracket groups indicate inputs in a single tick):

⬥ [Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Staff Equipped <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>] → [ <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> → Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031>]

⬥ [Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + DW Equipped <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>] → [Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Equip Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>]

**__Why is it Useful__**
⬥ Basis: kill boss → pick loot if worth it → quickly leave instance → re-join instance → repeat

.tag:shake
**__Camera Toggles__**
⬥ If you suffer from motion sickness, you may toggle this off in the settings menu. This is particularly useful for Rise of the Six tunnels, or usage of Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>.

⬥ However be aware that camera shake often helps indicate a mechanic is about to happen, for example at Solak or Black Stone Dragon.
