> **__Tick System__**
.tag:tick
⬥ The time between game information updates is 0.6 seconds, this is commonly referred to as a tick.
⬥ All of your actions will be registered on one of these intervals.
⬥ Below is a video on understanding the tick system and ways to take advantage of it.

.tag:tc
**__Keybind NPC Targetting__**
⬥ Targeting settings can be found under the Combat Tab in the Settings Interface and includes the situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Apqq3Th.png
.
⬥ This function allows you to select a target procedurally based on whether you set the targeting mode to Radial or Conal.

⬥ **Radial targeting:**
    • Cycles from the nearest to the farthest target from the player when pressed.
    • In the case of multiple equidistant targets, it will cycle clockwise starting from the north.
    • This is useful for simply snapping to the closest target available.

⬥ **Conal Targeting:**
    • Cycles from the closest to the farthest target in the direction the camera is facing.
    • The angle for an NPC to be considered eligible for selection is around 75-90°.
    • This is most useful for more precise targeting in scenarios with multiple NPCs around.

.
**__Why it is Useful__**
⬥ It is very useful for improving consistency and speed in nearly all boss encounters.
⬥ A notable advantage of target cycle is that Detonate is not cancelled upon selecting a new target before release.
    • Without target cycle if you wished to do this you would have to click and release on same tick to not lose Detonate

.
__**Notable Applications**__
⬥ **The Shadow Reef**
        - Tagging Sinister Fragments at the Ambassador, saves 4 ticks.

.
⬥ **Vorago**
    • Gaining aggro on p2 dropdown. This can solve the 1 HP P1 issue where P2 starts off with random aggro.
    • Tagging Teamsplit on drop to Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Teamsplit.
    • The timing for P3/P5 is 17 ticks from when you can crack heal:

https://youtu.be/9YejOAvquQk
.
⬥ **Nex: Angel of Death**
    • Radial targeting to tag P2 Amalgamations when Detonating <:deto:535533833358016512>. This allows to tag on spawn without risking cancelling detonate accidentally.
    • Tagging Pillars on P4, prevents possible misclicks with the camera snapping over after using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>.

⬥ **Solak**
    • Tagging the Blight Afflicted Core on spawn, potentially saves a tick which helps a bit for one-cycling.
    • Tagging Arms and Legs faster.

⬥ **GWD2**
    • The bosses with long spawn animations can be tagged immediately, which helps particularly on Helwyr.

⬥ When attempting to cycle to a target on spawn, spam clicking the keybind will not work so you just have to know the exact tick it becomes targetable.
    • Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick.

> **__Solo Flanking__(Courtesy of <@110810140445294592>)**
.tag:soloflanking
⬥ In this section, different use cases of solo Flanking will be explained.

⬥ **Case 1.0**: Target is stuck in position.
    • Target must be unable to move, not just their animation but actual position in the server.
    • Moving under or behind are the easiest flanking spots to reach.
    • Examples:
        - Black Stone Dragon while casting Smoke Spiral.
        - Taraket the Necromancer during the last phase as he casts Spirit Line.

⬥ **Case 1.5**: Target is stuck but the player is unable to reach behind the target.
    • This condition applies to certain bosses and mobs.
    • They might be casting an AoE mechanic that originates from their center.
    • Simply prepare ahead of time and step 1 tile away from any of the cardinal directions.
    • Once the target locks their position, move 1 tile towards the same cardinal direction and activate your flanking ability.
    • Below is an example of Raksha's tail swipe mechanic. Notice the last ability used was Impact within Sunshine buff:
.
.img:https://imgur.com/G1zlwXH.mp4
.
⬥ **Case 2**: Walking under an immovable and non-blocked target:
    • Taraket the Necromancer in his Ranged form.
    • Kerapac, while he is casting Shatter ability, upon landing from Jumping Slam, during casting Lightning Strike, and in his phase transitions (SS heal).
    • Any boss or monster that is rooted from Ice Barrage or Sticky Bombs can be walked under for flanking.
    • The Ambassador at all times:
.
.img:https://imgur.com/FMhz1Cm.mp4
.
⬥ **Case 3**: Target that are size 2x2 can always be flanked on two of their adjacent tiles.
    • Applicable bosses: Commander Zilyanna, Gregovic.
    • Applicable monsters: Sea Horrors, Scopulus, Ripper Demons, Nightmare Creatures, Igneous Tzekhaar-Xil, Igneous Tzekhaar-Hur.
    • Below is a picture of the 2 tiles where flanking will always work as well as an example of Igneous Tzkhaar-Hur:

> **__Critical Hits__ (Courtesy of <@844317937329766401>)**
.tag:crits
**__Brief Introduction__**
⬥ A Critical hit is when the player hits between 95% and 100% of potential damage with an ability or auto-attack, denoted by a bolder hit splat.
    • This is broken up into two categories: forced critical hits and natural critical hits
        - A forced critical hit is when the game forces you to critical hit, based on your chance to force a critical hit
        - A natural critical hit is when the game fails to force a critical hit, and instead rolls damage normally and hits within the critical damage range
⬥ Landing a Critical hit also increases your damage cap from 10000 to 12000 (15000 with <:grim:568262896375824385>, 15720 with <:grim:568262896375824385> and <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> using non-<:Magic:689504724159823906>) and 16800 with <:grim:568262896375824385> and <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> using <:Magic:689504724159823906>).
⬥ Forced critical chance is a unique combat stat in RuneScape, spread all-over different items and interacting in unique ways.
    • E.g. getting +5% critical hit means you are getting +5% chance to get a forced critical hit, this is where the game forces your damage to roll in the top 5% of possible damage range, as opposed to the upper 80% as usual.

.
**__Abilities interaction__**
⬥ **Fury <:fury:535532879510372352>**
    • Each <:fury:535532879510372352> hit increases your next hit's chance to force a critical hit by 5% per strike, up to a maximum of 15% after the 3rd hit
        - A previous <:fury:535532879510372352> hit can affect a subsequent <:fury:535532879510372352> hit because of this

⬥ **Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527>**
    • <:gfury:535532879334080527> turns <:fury:535532879510372352> into a non-channeled ability, granting 10% forced critical strike to your next hit.
    • If <:gfury:535532879334080527> itself critical hits, your next hit is guaranteed to be a critical hit.

⬥ **Concentrated blast <:conc:535533833106489365> & Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>**
    • Each <:conc:535533833106489365> / <:gconc:869285393223254107> hit increases your next hit's chance to force a critical hit by 5% per strike, up to a maximum of 15% after the 3rd hit.
        - A previous <:conc:535533833106489365> / <:gconc:869285393223254107> hit can affect a subsequent <:conc:535533833106489365> / <:gconc:869285393223254107> because of this

⬥ **Meteor strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>**
    • <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and <:incend:535541258429661215> each provide a 30 seconds that provides 10% adrenaline whenever your roll a critical hit.
    • <:incend:535541258429661215> starts the buff when it hits, while <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> / <:tsunami:535533809995874304> start the buff when you release them
    • The Corbicula Rex Perk from Player owned Farm **No Fear** increases the forced critical hit chance of <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> by 20% at tier 1 and 40% at tier 2.

.
⬥ **Smoke tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372>**
    • Each hit of smoke tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> will always critical hit granted you are properly using overload and prayer
        - There is some weird case where it is possible for it to calculate two critical hits in a single hit (i.e. providing 20% adrenaline in <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and <:incend:535541258429661215> instead of 10%)

⬥ **Abilities unable to critical hit**
    • Combustion <:comb:535533833098100745>
    • Corruption blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>

    • Ek-ZekKil special attack <:zekkil:903244090953588787> <:spec:537340400273195028> / <:eofspec:746403211908481184> bleed hits
    • Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290>
    • Onslaught <:onsl:513190159085207555>

.
**__Item interaction__**
⬥ **Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>**
    • Increases chance of forcing a critical hit by 3% when used.
    • If you land a critical strike while using these arrows you get a stack of *Feasting Spores*
        - Reaching 5 stacks of *Feasting Spores* causes your next Ranged threshold, ultimate or special attack to cost 0% adrenaline.
    • Getting a free ranged action has a 60 second cooldown.
        - Each critical hit landed during this cooldown reduces it by 1.8 seconds.

.
⬥ **Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451>**
    • The Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451> is a level 95 staff.
    • The Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451> has a special attack called *Instability*, which costs 50% adrenaline and has a 60 second cooldown between uses.
        - For the next 30 seconds whenever the player lands a critical hit with Magic **by any means** on your primary target, a lossless mainhand / two-handed auto attack will be fired based on your current autocast.

.
⬥ **Precise and Equilibrium**
    • Precise and Equilibrium both affect your maximum and minimum possible max hit by modifying the potential damage rolls ranges.
    • Precise increases your minimum damage by 1.5% per rank of your maximum damage
    • Equilibrium increases the minimum roll by 2.4% per rank & decreased the maximum hit by 0.8% per rank.
    • These will affect your chances of naturally rolling a critical hit

.
  **__Forced Critical Hit Chance increases__**
⬥ Some items increase the chance you force critical strikes and said items can stack together
    • E.g. combining the Biting 4 perk, A Reaver's ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050>, Erethdor's grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>, a Kal'gerion demon <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> using its scroll <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> you'll have a base Forced Critical strike chance of 31% (31.8% with biting at lv20).
.
⬥  **__Biting perk & Tuska's Might__**
    • The biting perk grants you +2% forced critical hit chance per rank.
    • Tuska's Might is the set effect of Tuska's warpriest, granting 1% force critical hit chance per piece equipped.
        - Usable with Anima Core of Sliske.
    • If Tuska's Might is in effect, then Biting is ignored.

.
⬥ **__Kal'gerion Demon <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925>__**
    • Special attack <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> grants a buff granting +5% forced critical hit chance to everyone around the Kal'gerion Demon for 60 seconds
        - <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> cannot be auto-fired
        - Ironman cannot benefit from other players' <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> buff
    • Has a passive effect that grants you a passive +1% forced critical hit chance

⬥  **__Erethdor's grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>__**
    • When active, Erethdor's grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385> will give you +12% forced critical hit chance and increase your critical hit damage cap from 12000 to 15000.

⬥  **__Channeler's ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>__**
    • When using any channeled ability with Magic you will get stacks of *Runic Embrace* for every hit in the channel, giving you a stacking +4% increase to your forced critical hit chance on each hit of the channel.
        - E.g. a 2-hit channel would get +4% on the first hit and +8% on the second hit due to Runic Embrace.

⬥  **__Champion's ring <:championring:839903943630520350>__**
    • if your target is suffering from any Bleed you'll get +3% forced critical hit chance.

⬥  **__Reaver's ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050>__**
    • At the cost of 5% accuracy, the Reaver's ring gives you a passive +5% forced critical hit chance.
        - Generally speaking, you can calculate this accuracy impact as 0.95\*(current hitchance).

⬥  **__Stalker's ring <:stalkerring:839903943601029120>__**
    • When using a bow, the <:stalkerring:839903943601029120> provides +3% increase to forced critical hit chance.
.
⬥  **__Smoke cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050>__**
    • It is a debuff applied to the boss, how it affects your critical hit damage cap depends on the style
    • For Magic:
        - Increases the target's damage received from critical strikes by 15%.
        - Critical hit damage cap increase to 13440 (no <:grim:568262896375824385>) or 16800 (with <:grim:568262896375824385>)
    • For non-Magic:
        - Increases the target's damage received from critical strikes by 6%.
        - Critical hit damage cap increase to 12576 (no <:grim:568262896375824385>) or 15.720 (with <:grim:568262896375824385>)

> **__Walking Bosses__ (Courtesy of <@236955913859104778>)**
.tag:walking
**__Moving NPCs__**
⬥ In RS, bosses only walk East, West, or South (never North). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards.
⬥ Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways:
    • East-walking boss will turn west
    • West-walking boss will turn south
    • South-walking boss will turn either east or west.
    • The Araxxor Walking Guide demonstrates this behavior:
.
https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k
.
**__Applications__**
⬥ The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.
    • Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>):
.
https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI
.
⬥ Advanced version: Use a bleed and then immediately Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to go under the boss and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get back all within a GCD.
    • This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD.
⬥ Reposition a boss: Fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams.
⬥ Most bosses move at 2 squares per tick, just like players' characters.
    • Bosses that you don’t want to walk, should be moved an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.

.tag:manualspellcasting
**__Where to Find it__**
⬥ Manual spell casting toggle can be found in the combat settings:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/e678FYp.png
.
**__What it Does and Why it is Useful__**
⬥ Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to.
    • The Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659>, and Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> spells deal damage scaling up to T99 while other spells are capped at a lower tier.

⬥ Enabling manual spell casting makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell.

⬥ Without manual spell casting enabled, Using Ice blitz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883>, while autocast is set to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, results in Ice Biltz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> becoming the autocast, which is capped at T92 damage
    • With manual spell casting toggled on, the autocast spell remains Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>:
        - Holds damage done to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> damage even if a lower damaging spell is casted.
        - This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with.
        - This is useful for players that are using the Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451> as otherwise the damage is reduced from T95 to T92.

.
⬥ On the normal spellbook, the player can manually cast Air Strike <:airstrike:895600427930910730> instead of Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, reducing Air rune costs by 4 per cast.

⬥ On Ancient spellbook, Aurora spells can be manually cast to benefit yourself or your teammates:
    • Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> can increase the damage of teammates by upto 3%.
    • Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% to yourself only.
    • Blood Burst <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> for the same damage and effect as Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> but a lower cost.

⬥ At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so.
    • Stops poorly timed binding of Telos or breaking his freedom too early by having control on when you want to freeze.
    • Potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence.

**__NPC Centre and NPC Coordinate__**
⬥ For all NPCs, there's two Attributes used as the center of the NPC:
    • NPC Centre: This differs depends on the size of NPC.
        - Odd-sized (1x1, 3x3, 5x5...): This will always be the centre tile.
        - Even-Sized (2x2, 4x4, 6x6...): This will always be the first SW tile in that NPC's middle region.

    • Equilibrium perk <:eq4:712073088589627505> is applied as normal.
    • The diminishing multiplier is as follows:

⬥ Ammunition with secondary effects, such as Blackstone arrows <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617>, also only proc/apply on Arrow 1.
    • Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> will apply for each calculated critical hit.

.
**__Where Arrows 2-5 can Land__**
1) Determine NPC's center
    a) The actual centre tile for odd sizes
    b) SW tile of the middle 2x2 area for even sizes

2) Choose a random tile that is: Floor(Size / 2) away from NPC centre.
    a) This will be the center tile of the SGB Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> arrow landing zone.
    b) It must be possible for the player to walk from this tile to the NPC's centre.
        - If the player can not walk from any of the tiles chosen randomly to the NPC centre, then the NPC Centre is used as a default.

3) Choose 4 random tiles in a 2 tile radius from the above tile
    • If an arrow chooses to land on a tile already chosen by a previous arrow, it will reroll its choice up to 10 times.

**__What Blocking Is__**
⬥ A blocked NPC is an NPC where the player is unable to reach the NPC centre tile.

⬥ The area covered by the SGB Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> is as shown above is a 5x5 area.

⬥ So, NPCs size 5x5 or bigger and are blocked will have all subsequent arrows land 100% of the time if the first arrows lands.
.
**__Practical Applications of This Info__**
⬥ Assuming best in slot gear, average damage will be as follows:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Us84iTb.png
.
⬥ SGB is only worth using on-style for 3x3+, and off-style for 5x5+

⬥ Multi SGB Hits:
    • Each spec that hits within 2 ticks will get a normal Arrow 1 hit.
        - Arrows 2-5 can hit as normal and any arrows beyond those will continue to scale down linearly until their max hit is the same as their min hit.

⬥ Crit chance for these is updated when they are "cast," i.e., after Arrow 1 hits/3t after SGB cast.

⬥ Ingenutiy of the Humans <:ingen:641339234111848463> makes Arrow 1 hit with 100% accuracy, so the remaining arrows can not splash.
    • This is because normally if you <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if Arrow 1 hits, Arrows 2-5 do not splash

.
**__SGB EoF interactions__** <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofblue:780401412906680330>
⬥ **Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> SGB:**
    • Acts as if you have SGBed N times, once per target affected by the Chin effect.
⬥  **Bakriminel bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> SGB:**
    • As mentioned, these are determined on cast, so only Arrow 1 can proc them
        - But if it affects Arrow 1's hit directly (e.g., Ruby <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> / Onyx <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>) it will also affect Arrows 2-5's damage as described earlier

.tag:adrengain
**__Stalling Adrenaline__**
⬥ After doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds.

⬥ After 10 seconds, you will only be able to gain adren for 1 defensive basic for every 10 seconds.

⬥ The following abilities do not affect or reset this “cooldown”:
    • Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escape:535541258832052231>, and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>)
    • Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD)
    • Ultimates that do not require a target.

⬥ An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown):

.tag:poison
**__How it Works__**
⬥ Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used.
    • While this is active, players have a 12.5% chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune.
    • After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes.
    • Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it.

⬥ Damage is derived in the following manner:
    • Poison damage starts with a base value of 20% of the player's ability damage, base Weapon Poison representing 100% of this damage.
    • Each tier of poison adds +25% to this value. Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> will also provide an additional 25%.
    • Damage is rolled between 65-130% of this final poison damage value.
    • Unless refreshed, the damage range will be reduced by 3% on every subsequent hit (63.5-127%, 62-124%, etc.)
    • Final Damage Ranges:
        - Weapon Poison = 13.00-26.00%
        - Weapon Poison+ = 16.25-32.50%
        - Weapon Poison++ = 19.50-39.00%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 22.75-45.50%
        - Cinderbanes+++ = 26.00-52.00%
    • Average Damage Values:
        - Weapon Poison = 19.50%
        - Weapon Poison+ = 24.36%
        - Weapon Poison++ = 29.25%
        - Weapon Poison+++ = 34.13%
        - Cinderbanes+++ = 39.00%

⬥ Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>, Kwuarm Incense Sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>, Bik Arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>, and Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> increase poison damage values, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not.

.
⬥ **Cinderbane Gloves** <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>:
    • The gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, 12.5% chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target.
    • This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset.
    • This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat has a 12.5% chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer.
        - With this considered, the effective application rate per hitsplat is ~14.3%
    • Even without consuming Weapon Poison, the gloves will apply poison damage as if Weapon Poison+ was in effect.

.
⬥ **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>:
    • Per potency level, Kwuarm Incense Sticks will add a multiplicative damage increase of 2.5% to the player's final poison damage.
    • At maximum potency, this is a multiplicative 10% to poison damage.
    • This brings the range of Weapon Poison+++ with Cinderbane Gloves worn to 28.60-57.52%, or an average of 42.9% ability damage.

.
⬥ **Bik Arrows** <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>:
    • Per stack, Bik Arrows will add a multiplicative damage increase of 2% to the player's final poison damage.
        - An arrow is consumed for every stack added, which are applied on every ranged ability hit. *Bleed effects after the initial cast do NOT add any stacks.*
        - Bik arrow stacks will last for **30 seconds**, with the timer refreshing every time a new stack is applied.
        - Bik arrows will continue to be consumed in the espected manner even after reaching maximum stacks, and they will continue refreshing the effect.
    • At maximum stacks (200) this is a multiplicative 400% damage increase, or an effective **5x multiplier** to poison damage.
    • This brings the range of Weapon Poison+++ with Cinderbane Gloves and Kwuarm Incense Sticks to 143.00-287.60%, or an average of 214.50% ability damage.

.
⬥ **Laniakea's Spear** <:lanispear:839903893177106454>:
    • The application rate of poison is boosted by an additive 5%, increasing it to 17.5%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~21.2%, up from ~14.3%.
    • Poison damage is increased by a multiplicative 5%, similar to Kwuarm Incense Sticks.

.
⬥ **Upgraded Bone Blowpipe**:
    • Poison damage is halved, but the application rate is doubled to 25%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~33.3%, up from ~14.3%.

.
⬥ **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>:
    • Applies its own "poison" damage separate from normal weapon poison.
        - 50% chance on hit to apply a stacking damage over time effect.
        - Hits every 2 ticks after application, up to 5 hits unless refreshed before the final hit.
        - When refreshed, the damage will increase and hit another 5 times.
        - Damage starts with a range of 10-24 per hit, and can climb up to 125-249 per hit.
    • While this weapon doesn't directly influence the base damage or application rate of poison, the passive effect hits very rapidly and consistently.
    • This allows for more chances for poison hits to occur.

.
⬥ Poison can be applied/refreshed by **any player-sourced damage**. This includes:
    • Abilities (Includes every hit from bleeds/damage over time, including Sunshine & Death's Swiftness)
    • Abyssal Parasites
    • Auras (Ancestor Spirits & Dark Magic)
    • Auto attacks
    • Bakriminel/Enchanted Bolt extra hits (Emerald & Dragonstone)
    • Blood necklaces
    • Blood Reaver passive
    • Cannon damage
    • Dominion mines
    • Eldritch Crossbow special
    • God books and Scriptures
    • Poison damage
    • Puncture bleeds
    • Reflect damage
    • Wyvern Crossbow passive.

⬥ The ability rotation being done is: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:barge:535532853916860437> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → (4-hit) <:destroy:535532879330148352> → (3-hit) <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333>
    • Clearly the last flank Backhand did not go off inside your berserk even though it was queued at that point.
    • To resolve this either do not queue the ability that will be casted on the last tick of your ultimate, or turn of ability queueing

**__What Is a Hex Modifier__**
⬥ This refers to the passive effect of the Hexhunter bow <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, Terrasaur maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, and Inquisitor staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>.
    • The modifier is commonly just called "Hex" because the <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> was the first weapon released with this effect.

.
**__What Is the Passive Effect__**
⬥ When active, it provides +12.5% ability damage and +10% hit chance.

⬥ This damage increase applies to all abilities and auto attacks, but not to poison, Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009>, or Crackling <:crack4:712073087662686249> procs.

⬥ The hit chance increase is a flat +10% over typical T80 weapon hit chance values before the effects of DBA <:DBA:603979368850653216> and Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> are considered.

.
**__When is the Effect Active__**
⬥ To receive the buffs, you must be against a target whose main attack style is weak to your weapon's style (based on the combat triangle).

⬥ If you don't see a debuff icon under your target's health bar indicating it is susceptible to your weapon, you are effectively using a normal T80 weapon.

.
**__What Does This all Mean__**
⬥ Expect to see a ~4.8%/3.4%/1.4% damage increase over T90/T92/T95 weapons, provided you aren't losing any hits due to the lower accuracy.

⬥ It is a common misconception that the weapons have T97 damage and accuracy

⬥ This is only a theoretical effective tier for their damage and is only true with sufficient level boosts and equipment bonuses.

⬥ The hit chance is typically slightly above that of a T90 weapon, but because it is a flat hit chance increase, this scales up as the target's armour increases.

⬥ This can result in roughly a 6% increase in damage across the course of an entire rotation, but will significantly increase the amount of inputs.

⬥ This happens because critical hits are rolled on cast, while modifiers like scrimshaws are calculated on hit.

    • All hits of this nature are categorized as either hard typeless or soft typeless.

.
**__Hard Typeless__**
⬥ This is damage that is unaffected by nearly all damage modifiers.

.
**__Soft Typeless__**
⬥ This is damage that is scaled by most modifiers.
    • Decreased by all defensive abilities, <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, etc.
    • Increased by <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, Zerk auras, etc.
