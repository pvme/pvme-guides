**__Keybind NPC Targetting__**
Targeting settings can be found under the Combat Tab in the Settings Interface and includes the situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds. This function allows you to select a target procedurally based on whether you set the targeting mode to Radial or Conal. It is very useful for improving consistency and speed in nearly all boss encounters. A notable advantage of cycle target is that Detonate will not be cancelled upon use.

⬥ **Radial targeting:** Cycles from the nearest to the farthest target from the player when pressed. In the case of multiple equidistant targets, it will cycle clockwise starting from the north. This is useful for simply snapping to the closest target available.

⬥ **Conal Targeting:** Cycles from the closest to the farthest target in the direction the camera is facing. The angle for an NPC to be considered eligible for selection is around 75-90°. This is most useful for more precise targeting in scenarios with multiple NPCs around.

__**Notable Applications**__
⬥ **The Shadow Reef**
    • Tagging Sinister Fragments at the Ambassador, saves 4 ticks.

.
⬥ **Vorago**
    • Gaining aggro on p2 dropdown. This can solve the 1 HP P1 issue where P2 starts off with random aggro.
    • Tagging Teamsplit on drop to Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Teamsplit.
    • The timing for P5 Teamsplit is 17 ticks from when you can crack heal.

.
.
⬥ **Nex: Angel of Death**
    • Radial targeting to tag P2 Amalgamations when Detonating <:deto:535533833358016512>. This allows to tag on spawn without risking cancelling detonate accidentally.
    • Tagging Pillars on P4, prevents possible misclicks with the camera snapping over after using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>.

.
⬥ **Solak**
    • Tagging the Blight Afflicted Core on spawn, potentially saves a tick which helps a bit for one-cycling.
    • Tagging Arms and Legs faster.

.
⬥ **GWD2**
    • The bosses with long spawn animations can be tagged immediately, which helps particularly on Helwyr.

*Note: When attempting to cycle to a target on spawn, spam clicking the keybind will not work so you just have to know the exact tick it becomes targetable. Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick.*

.tag:walking
**__Moving NPCs__**
⬥ In RS, bosses only walk East, West, or South (never North). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards.

.
⬥ Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways: an east-walking boss will turn west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and a south-walking boss will turn either east or west. The Araxxor Walking Guide demonstrates this behavior:
.
https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k
.
**__Applications__**
⬥ The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>. Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>):
.
https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI
.
*Note: A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to go under the boss and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD.*

.
⬥ Walking can also be used to reposition a boss, such as fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams.

.
*Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don’t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.*

.tag:manualspellcasting
.
**__Saving Rune Costs__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/e678FYp.png
.
⬥ Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, Blitz <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>, and Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier.
    • Particularly, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects.

.
⬥ However, this issue is resolved with manual spell casting found in the combat settings. This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell.
⬥ Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and they use Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659>, their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90.
    • With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs.
        - This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with.

.
__**Applications**__
⬥ On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1.

⬥ On Ancients, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell.
    • Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster.
    • Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% on a personal basis, potentially allowing some use in a solo pvm situation.

⬥ Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> under manual spell casting.

⬥ At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so.
    • Binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off.
    • With the toggle on, the player has increased control over when to bind Telos and potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence.

.tag:autocast
**__Ensuring Both Weapons are Casting Spells__**
⬥ When selecting an autocast spell, be sure to manually select it with dual-wield (main-hand + off-hand). Selecting your autocast with a two-handed weapon will only apply it to the main-hand, thus setting no off-hand spell, causing you to do 2/3 damage when doing dual-wield abilities in this manner.

⬥ Here is a comparison. First example is selecting your autocast with two-handed weapon first (main-hand autocast). Second example is selecting your autocast with dual-wield weapon first (main-hand + off-hand autocast).

.tag:centre
**__Boss Center Square is Always South-West__**
⬥ This affects abilities like Corruption blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>.
On something like a combat dummy, the true centre is in the centre because the size of the dummy is 1 square, but any monster 2 by 2 or larger has a south-west centre.

.
⬥ In picture A, the Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> green arrows are on the centre of the Dragon, meaning the Dragon to the North will not be hit by the ability.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/cPreXnV.png
.
⬥ In picture B, the arrows are perfectly aligned and will allow detonate to hit both Dragons. This means you should always try to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit.

> **__How Adren Gaining Without a Target Works__ (Courtesy of <@236955913859104778>)**
.tag:adrengain
**__Stalling Adrenaline__**
⬥ After doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds. After that, defensive basics will no longer give adren.
    • There is an important caveat: you will only be unable to gain adren for 10 seconds. After that, you can use ONE defensive basic that will give you adren, after which you will be unable to gain adren again for 10s. Think of this as a cooldown - 10s after the last damaging ability on a boss, you will only be able to build once every 10s. The following abilities do not affect or reset this “cooldown”:
        - Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escapecodex:602561894443778115>, and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>)
        - Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD)
        - Ultimates that do not require a target

⬥ An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> + a defensive basic that was used NO earlier than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren.
    • You would be able to use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> to stall, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> when your Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> has run out.

.
*Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi and Telos)*

> **__Weapon Poison__ (Courtesy of <@108682527304060928>)**
.tag:poison
**__How it Works__**
⬥ Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used.
    • While this is active, players have a 12.5% chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune. After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes.
    • This 3 minute duration also has a chance to be refreshed at a 12.5% rate.
    • Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it.

⬥ Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> affects this damage, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not.

.
⬥ Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> heavily boost the amount of damage that can be dealt by poison.
    • While worn, the gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, allowing for a 12.5% chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target.
    • This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset.
    • This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat also has a 12.5% chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer.

.
⬥ Without using weapon poison, the damage supplied by Cinderbane Gloves' own poison will be closer to that of Weapon Poison+.
    • However, they increase the damage that applied weapon poison deals.
    • The +++ variant is increased to an average 36.5% ability damage from 27.9%.
        - Coupled with Kwuarm incense sticks, this value raises further to 46.5%.

.
⬥ Laniakea's Spear greatly compliments Cinderbane Gloves' effect, greatly increasing the application rate of poison.
    • The application rate of poison is boosted by an additive 5%, increasing it to 17.5%.
        - When considering poison re-applying itself, this gives an effective application rate per hitsplat of ~21.2%, up from ~14.3%.
    • Poison damage is increased by 5% as well, but only effects the final value and not the damage range.

.
⬥ Poison can be applied/refreshed by **any player-sourced damage**. This includes:
    • Auto attacks
    • Abilities
    • God books
    • Reflect damage
    • Blood necklaces
    • Cannon damage
    • Puncture bleeds
    • Poison damage
    • Wyvern Crossbow passive
    • Eldritch Crossbow special
    • Dominion mines
    • Blood Reaver passive

> **__Zerk Auras and On-Cast Ult Interactions__ (Courtesy of <@781280949790572554>)**
.tag:zerkAura
Normally throughout your Sunshine, Death's Swiftness, and Berserk, the 10% damage increase from your Maniacal, Reckless, and Berserker Auras do not come into effect. However, there is a caveat in which you can get *both* the Ultimate boost and Aura boost, which is colloquially referred to as "last tick of ult."

.
⬥ Since the listed ultimates apply their buff on cast while the listed auras apply their buff on hit, by simply casting an ability in your ultimate and it hitting after the ultimate lets it get buffed by the 10% from aura too since the ultimate is now over and the buff can be applied.

.
⬥ Notice the following image: the same ability is cast, yet one hit significantly harder, that is because of this interaction
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0TxDCjz.png
.
⬥ It is also important to take caution when using queuing, for if you queue something it delays the cast by 1 tick
    • This can cause issues when trying to cast an ability on the final tick of an ultimate to get the ultimate and aura damage modifiers stacking, as it makes your ability cast after the ultimate ends, rather than on the final tick.
    • This can be seen in the following video clip (courtesy of <@683763716394975294>):
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/JlBezRH.mp4
.
The ability rotation being done is: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:barge:535532853916860437> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → (4-hit) <:destroy:535532879330148352> → (3-hit) <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:flankicon:841419289755385866> <:backhand:535532854302605333>
    • As can be seen, despite no ticks being lost, the <:backhand:535532854302605333> at the start of <:zerk:535532854004678657> dealt 3977 but the one on the final tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657> dealt 2185 as it was actually casted out of <:zerk:535532854004678657> due to this interaction.
    • The solution to it as follows:
        - Firstly, you can just not queue an ability that will be casted on the last tick of your ultimate
        - Secondly, you can turn queuing off

.
> **__Grimoire and Scrimshaw Switching__**
.tag:grimshaw
**__Obtaining both pocket slot's benefits__**
Due to the fact that damage critical hits are calculated as an ability is fired, but modifiers like scrimshaw are calculated when an ability hits, it is possible to obtain the boosts of Erethdor's Grimoire at the same time as a Scrimshaw. This can result in roughly a 6% increase in damage across the course of an entire rotation, but will significantly increase the amount of inputs.

⬥ Inputs for grimshaw with 4taa, in order (bracket groups indicate inputs in a single tick):

[Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Staff Equipped <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>] → [ <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> → Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031>]

[Have Active Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + DW Equipped <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>] → [Ability → Equip and activate Scrimshaw]  → [Equip Grimoire and Activate Grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> + Equip Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>]

.tag:inshopp
**__Why is it Useful__**
⬥ Some boss encounters, such as the whole God Wars Dungeon 2, take place inside an private instance. Although useful to prevent world crowding from annoying you in PvM, there is a downside: Bosses will not respawn instantly inside it.
    • There is a method used to reduce the spawn time of the bosses, and it consists of: kill boss → pick loot if worth it → quickly leave instance → re-join instance → repeat

Comparison of waiting for spawn time x instance hopping: https://youtu.be/O-Lb93vFRAI
.
*Note: Although the difference might seem small, over the course of multiple (30+ kills) it adds up significantly.*
