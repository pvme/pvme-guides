**__Keybind NPC Targetting__**
Targeting settings can 🤸🔫 be 😩 found 🤔❌ under 😡👇 the Combat Tab in the 🌈 Settings Interface and includes the 👏 situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds. This ⬆😞 function allows you 🙂 to 💦 select ❇❇ a target procedurally based 😤😫 on 🔛 whether ☂ you 👉 set ⚔⚔ the 💅🔮 targeting mode to 💦 Radial or Conal. It is 🙈 very 🏽 useful for improving consistency and 💦 speed in nearly all 😡 boss 🏼 encounters. A notable advantage of 😤🎖 cycle target is 💦 that 😐👉 Detonate will 🅱 not 🙅🚫 be ❌ cancelled upon use.

⬥ **Radial targeting:** Cycles from the nearest to ♀ the 👭⛓ farthest target from the 💦 player when pressed. In 👆👏 the 👫🏿 case 😂😂 of multiple equidistant targets, it ✋🙅 will 💦🙏 cycle clockwise starting from the north. 💈☝ This 🚟🏋 is 👏 useful for simply ⤵😡 snapping to the 👏👦 closest target available.

⬥ **Conal Targeting:** Cycles from 👉 the closest to 💦👉 the farthest target in 📥 the direction the camera 📹📷 is 🤔😅 facing. The angle for an NPC to 💦 be 🐝🌈 considered eligible for selection is 🗡 around 💿↪ 75-90°. This 👈 is 💦😧 most useful for 🕓🍆 more 😩✋ precise targeting in 👉👏 scenarios with multiple NPCs around. 😲💦

__**Notable Applications**__
⬥ **The Shadow 👤 Reef**
    • Tagging Sinister Fragments at 🚓 the 🔚☝ Ambassador, saves 4 💦🏽 ticks. 
.img:https://i.gyazo.com/a3b13b217022a8523de01b4e50b3cc9f.mp4
.
⬥ **Vorago**
    • Gaining 🏋 aggro on p2 dropdown. This can 🔫 solve the 💦 1 HP P1 issue 🙅😭 where P2 starts 🕹↔ off with 🏼 random 🎰 aggro.
    • Tagging Teamsplit on drop to Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Teamsplit.
    • The 💰 timing for P5 Teamsplit is 17 🏼 ticks from 👈👉 when 🍑 you can 🔫💁 crack ☑ heal.
https://youtu.be/9YejOAvquQk
.
.
⬥ **Nex: Angel 👼 of 💦😤 Death** 👻👻
    • Radial targeting to tag P2 Amalgamations when Detonating <:deto:535533833358016512>. This allows to tag on spawn without risking cancelling detonate accidentally.
    • Tagging Pillars on P4, prevents possible misclicks with the camera snapping over after using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>.

.
⬥ **Solak**
    • Tagging the 👏 Blight Afflicted Core 💰 on 👋👏 spawn, potentially saves a 🅱 tick which 🤤 helps a 🍆 bit 😢 for one-cycling.
    • Tagging Arms and 👏 Legs faster.

.
⬥ **GWD2**
    • The bosses with long 🍆😩 spawn animations can 🔫💦 be tagged immediately, 🤣 which 👏 helps particularly on 🔛🚟 Helwyr.

*Note: When attempting to cycle to a target on spawn, spam clicking the keybind will not work so you just have to know the exact tick it becomes targetable. Alternatively if you're constantly moving you can spam it once per tick.*

**__Moving NPCs__**
⬥ In RS, bosses only 😤 walk 🚶🚶 East, 👉🌍 West, or 🕍 South 👇 (never 😐🚫 North). 💈💈 The 😮⛓ direction they 👉👧 walk 🚶🏃 is 🔥🏻 random at 👀🍆 first, ☝☝ but they 👨 will 😳 always walk in 👉💆 that 💲 direction afterwards.

.
⬥ Hitting 😦😦 a ⬇🏭 wall ⌨⌨ changes 💰 walking ♀ behavior 😦 in 🏼👮 the following ways: an east-walking 🌍 boss 😂 will 🎬 turn 🏼❗ west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and 🔙👏 a south-walking boss 👨 will turn either 🤷 east or 💰 west. The Araxxor Walking ♀🍑 Guide demonstrates this behavior:
.
https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k 🤑
.
**__Applications__**
⬥ The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>. Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of <@287398612558675968>):
.
https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI 🐕
.
*Note: A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to go under the boss and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD.*

.
⬥ Walking 🚶🚶 can 👌 also be 💎💦 used 🙄 to reposition a boss, such 😱 as 🗻🕑 fixing base 👺 spot 🐱⏺ on 🙏 P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out 🌐😬 of 🌾 green bomb mists, and 💩😲 moving Telos out of 👨 beams.

.
*Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don’t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement.*

**__Saving Rune Costs__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/e678FYp.png
.
⬥ Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, Blitz <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>, and Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier. 
    • Particularly, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects.

.
⬥ However, this 😂 issue 🏾🏾 is resolved with 😡 manual spell 🔤 casting found 👉 in 👏👏 the 👏👏 combat 🤼🤼 settings. This 🙋 toggle makes it 🤔 so that 👈 the 💩☺ autocast spell that ♀ the player's 🤷🏋 weapon ⚔🚮 is set 📚👌 to does 😈 not change 👎🆙 even if they ⚖ attack with 👏➡ a different 💰💰 spell. 🏻💪 
⬥ Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and they use Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659>, their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90. 
    • With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs. 
        - This 😆💯 is due 👅 to 🐚🔃 magic ability 👉 damage ☠☠ being 😑 based 💦 on the 😩👏 current autocast spell, not 🚫👏 the 🏻 spell the 👏 player ♀👨 last ♿🕛 attacked with.

.
__**Applications**__
⬥ On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1.

⬥ On Ancients, the Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell. 
    • Ruby Aurora <:RubyAurora:574292444791963659> is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster. 
    • Emerald Aurora provides damage ☄☄ reduction up to 🙅 5% 💄😂 on a 👏 personal basis, 💰💰 potentially allowing some 💥🕯 use 👏😂 in 🍆📅 a 😂 solo 🎸 pvm situation. 

⬥ Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> under manual spell casting.

⬥ At Telos, manual spell 🔤🔤 casting may 💯 be 🐝 used 🎶🚟 to 💰👮 prevent 🚫🚫 the 😱👏 player 🤷 from accidentally 😣 auto attacking ♂ with 🐺 an 🔥😆 Ice 💎 spell 🔤🔤 when 🕛 it 😤☝ may 💖♀ be 🐝🐝 undesirable to ✌👆 do 💯 so. 😳😴 
    • Binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off. 
    • With 👌 the 🌊🙀 toggle on, 🏄 the 🗣👏 player 📅 has 🙏👏 increased ➕➕ control 😤😡 over ♂ when 🍑 to 👅😥 bind Telos and 💰 potential ping spikes won't 💪🆗 have 👏🙀 as much 😂👌 of 💦 an 💶 unintended consequence. 😭😭

.tag:autocast
**__Ensuring Both Weapons are Casting Spells__**
⬥ When selecting an autocast spell, be 🏼 sure to ♀👵 manually select ❇ it 😂🥇 with dual-wield (main-hand + off-hand). 📴 Selecting 👍 your 👏 autocast with 🆕😋 a two-handed 💏 weapon will only apply it 💯 to the 👥 main-hand, thus setting no 😤🤔 off-hand 📴 spell, causing you 😍 to 👏 do 👌 2/3 😍😩 damage ☠ when doing dual-wield 🏏 abilities in ⤵👏 this 🏼🅿 manner. 🚁🚁

⬥ Here is a 🅰👏 comparison. First 😎👆 example 🔥 is 😦🏼 selecting 👍👍 your 👏 autocast with 👏 two-handed weapon first (main-hand autocast). Second ☝🥈 example is 😄 selecting 👍👍 your 👏👀 autocast with 👏 dual-wield weapon first ☝☝ (main-hand + off-hand 😂😊 autocast).

.tag:centre
**__Boss Center Square__**
⬥ This affects abilities like Corruption blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>. 
In the 🎁 picture with 👏 the 👏🐆 combat 🕰 dummy, ❤ the true centre is 💦🅱 in 👏👏 the centre because 😏❌ the size of the 👏 dummy ❤ is 😄 1 square, but any 💦📨 monster 2 by 2 or 👉📉 larger has 👩🚪 a south-west 👇 centre. 

⬥ In picture A, the Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> green arrows are on the centre of the Dragon, meaning the Dragon to the North will not be hit by the ability.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/cPreXnV.png

.
⬥ In picture B, the arrows are perfectly aligned and will allow detonate to hit both Dragons. This means you should always try to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7JT4mVE.png

.tag:adrengain
**__Stalling Adrenaline__**
⬥ After doing 📌🅰 your 🏻💦 last 🤤 damaging ability on 🅱 an NPC, you 🏾👉 can 💦 use any 💦 abilities to 😱😛 gain adren for 🔯👷 then 🅰⚔ next 10 🅾💯 seconds. 🕞 After 👀 that, 👉🚟 defensive basics will 👏 no 🚫 longer 😏😏 give 💯🤝 adren. 
    • There is an important 🤣 caveat: you 😩 will only 😌👃 be 😡🏿 unable to gain 🔑 adren for 🎁🍆 10 🔟🔟 seconds. 😫🕞 After 😏😡 that, you 🏾 can 👀 use ⚒ ONE defensive basic that will 👏 give you 👆👀 adren, after which 👏 you 💯 will be unable 🙅🙅 to 💦💦 gain 🔼 adren again 😬 for 😘 10s. Think 🤤😯 of this ⬆ as 💦😠 a 👌🥔 cooldown - 10s after the last ♿ damaging ability 👉 on a 🏠 boss, 👨👨 you ♂👏 will only be ⚰🍆 able to 💦 build 🏚 once 🏳 every 👏 10s. The following abilities do 👌😱 not 🚫 affect or 😇 reset this “cooldown”: 
        - Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escapecodex:602561894443778115>, and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>)
        - Defensive thresholds (these 🤤🚱 will always 👌 take 👨🅰 15 adren unless 💁💁 you 😤👉 lose 🚫 target, and 👉 their 🍆🤡 use does ❓🏋 not affect the CD)
        - Ultimates that 🙅 do not require 📜📜 a 🤑🚓 target

⬥ An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> + a defensive basic that was used NO earlier than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren. 
    • You would be able to use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> to stall, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> when your Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> has run out.

.
*Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi and Telos)*

.tag:poison
**__How it Works__**
⬥ Weapon Poison 🤒 provides a 🅱✝ buff 💪💪 to 🙅🌋 the 🌑🌊 player for 💯 an 🍎😚 amount 🔢 of time dependent on 💰 the 💓👏 grade 🎒 of 😂 poison being 😑 used. 
    • While 👶🙌 this 👈👩 is 💦 active, 🔊🏃 players ☹ have a 💯🚪 1/6 chance of 👏🚑 poisoning a ☠🏻 target so long 🕗 as they are not 🙅 poison-immune. 🤒🤒 After being 😥 poisoned, 😨 the 🔝😟 target will take 🛍🅰 damage ☠☄ every 16 🤐 game 🎮💣 ticks, or 9.6 🖕 seconds, and will 💯😛 continue to take 😥✋ damage for 🎁 3 😭 minutes. 😳⏰ 
    • This 👇♂ 3 😧 minute ⏰ duration also 😛 has 👏👏 a 👦 chance 🙅 to be refreshed at a 👻💰 1/6 rate. 📊👦 
    • Poison damage will 🤗⚽ hit 👊 2 ticks after the damage that 👉⬅ applied it. 😫✋

⬥ Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> affects this damage, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not.

.
⬥ Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> heavily boost the amount of damage that can be dealt by poison. 
    • While 🏻🕑 worn, the gloves effectively ignore 🔇🔇 the 👉 16 🤐🤐 tick cooldown on poison damage, ☄☄ allowing for a 😙👭 1/6 🌅 chance 😱 of 🍞 reapplication and ☝🚟 refreshing the 💅 poison timer on the target. 
    • This 😬 reapplication will 👏🤔 incur an 👏😘 extra 🗣😜 poison hit, and 👏🔙 the 16 tick damage ☄☠ timer is also ➕➕ reset. 
    • This effect also ✅ allows for 👉 poison to ⚔ reapply itself, 👏 so 💯 each 👋👋 poison 🤒 hitsplat also ➕ has 👏 a 1/6 🌸🤜 chance of 👉👏 dealing 🚬🏾 an extra poison hit 🚬 and 🔽 refreshing the 😮 timer.

⬥ Without using 📤 weapon ⚔ poison, 🤒🤒 the 🍆🏕 damage ☠ supplied by 👉😈 Cinderbane Gloves' own poison will 🤤😳 be 🌼 closer 😏 to 😘👊 that 🤢 of 😱🌾 Weapon 🗡⚔ Poison+. 🤒 
    • However, 🖐💰 they 👥 increase the damage ☠ that applied weapon ‼ poison deals. 
    • The 🏳 +++ variant ⚗⚗ is increased to an 🤗 average 36.5% ability 👉👉 damage ☄☄ from 27.9%. 
        - Coupled with Kwuarm incense sticks, this 👈👈 value raises further to 👉⬇ 46.5%.

.
⬥ Poison 🤒🤒 can 🔫 be 👌🅱 applied/refreshed by 😈 **any 💦💦 player-sourced 💰🎮 damage**. This 🚟 includes:
    • Auto attacks.
    • Abilities.
    • God books. 🔥
    • Reflect damage.
