Unlike OSRS which has the RuneLite client, RS3 only has its NXT client. In order to add some extra QoL/features, the Alt1 Toolkit was developed by <@107515476296368128>. This channel serves as a brief overview about Alt1 and what it's used for, as well as some extra helpful add-ons/plugins developed for it.

## __Alt1 Overview__
.tag:alt1
### What Is Alt1
.
Alt1 is a 3rd-party program that consists of several application overlays on your screen. They get information by reading your screen, and provide a bunch of QoL/useful features.

A detailed explanation of Alt1's features can be found on the Alt1 website, but amongst its default features it includes:
⬥ **AFK Warden** - the most common use for Alt1, its in-game activity detection overlays
⬥ **Clue Solver** - solves all clue puzzles and displays output as an overlay to speed up clue solving
⬥ **DgKey** - an overlay of your Dungeoneering <:dungeoneering:1003947795541143632> map to keep track of gatestones, teammates, etc.
⬥ **Stats Lookup** - look up a player's stats ;stats;, quest points, etc.
⬥ **Item Lookup** - quickly find any item's page on the Runescape Wiki
⬥ **D&D Notifications** - opt in for D&D notification alerts
⬥ **XpMeter** - track XP/hr rates in real time
⬥ **Droplogger** - an alternative to using the endgame RuneMetrics drop log

.
### How It Works
⬥ Alt1 is designed to capture images of the NXT Client and parse them with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Library.
⬥ The captured data is then transformed into pixel data that can be used in Alt1 apps.
⬥ More information can be found on the forums and in the Alt1 Toolkit discord.

.
### Is It Safe?
⬥ Alt1 is essentially a glorified Chromium browser that creates overlays over your game. Every Alt1 app is essentially a webpage.
⬥ Alt1 does not send any inputs or otherwise directly interact with your client beyond reading the pixels on the screen.
⬥ **It is not a client, therefore you won't get banned for using it.**

.
## __AFK Warden__
.tag:afkwarden
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/UG5psi4.png
### What Is AFK Warden
⬥ This is one of the most commonly used Alt1 apps, so will be covered in some detail here.
⬥ This reads the pixels on your screen to recognize your character, buff bars, chatbox and more in order to provide AFK alert notifications.
⬥ It tracks a number of things, including:
    • HP <:Constitution:689509250887712902> and Prayer <:prayer:1005450651347730533> alerts
    • Buff timers like <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368>
    • Familiar duration <:Summoning:583430259064569856>
    • Loot beams <:coins:698816156961603654>
    • AFK lobby timers
    • Seren Spirits and Blessings of the Gods
    • Character stance (for AFK skilling alerts)
    • XP drops, and more.

.
## __Clue Solver__
.tag:cluesolver
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/EhTPOsI.png
### What Is Clue Solver
⬥ This is a very useful app that looks at your currently open clue on screen, and tells you how to solve it.
⬥ It handles all clue steps, including puzzle boxes, scans, compass clues, etc. With the exception of scan clues.
⬥ Have your clue visible on-screen clearly and click the 'Unlock Any' button to find a solution to your clue that will be displayed on the overlay.
