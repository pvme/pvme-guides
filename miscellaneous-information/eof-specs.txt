**__More In-depth Breakdown for Each Special Attack__**
Note: Any niche uses for EoF spec weapons will have their uses in the [boss] guide channels, along with how worthwhile it is in that encounter. It is up to you to determine if that niche is something you would like to invest in.
Note: Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> works the same as it would on their respective special attacks.
