⬥ More advanced bosses and rotations may involve using additional bars, this will be covered later.
⬥ Try to keep switches, prayers and food on the left side of this bar so you may open ability books to manually use abilities.
⬥ These are set up in this way so you can open your ability books and manually cast abilities while having access to your prayers, weapons and food.

⬥ Revolution Action Bar remains the same and Main action bar has been swapped
