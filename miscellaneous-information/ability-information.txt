.tag:hitspeed
Certain weapon overrides for ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage to only take 1 tick to deal damage depending on your distance from your target. These abilities include Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>, Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944>, Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860>, and ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521>. Slow abilities which are unaffected include: Needle Strike, Binding Shot, and Tight Bindings.
⬥ Javelins (DW Override only mainhand required.) 📋 cause 🎗 Piercing Shot 🔫 and 🔛📕 Ricochet to hit 👊👉 fast 🏿🚦 from md-1sq away, Snapshot 📸📸 and 👏 Rapid Fire are 😤👏 only 💪👏 fast in 👏 md. 
⬥ Blowpipe (2H Override) causes Dazing Shot 🔫🔫 to hit 💢👉 fast ⌚🚦 from md-1sq away, ♀👀 Rapid Fire 🔥 and 🍆➕ Snapshot are both 🌜 fast from md-3sq away, and Ricochet/Piercing Shot are fast 😌🏃 from 🏽 md-4sq away
⬥ You can 🔫🔫 override your 🏻🏾 DW/2H weapons with these 😱🍔 weapon 🗡 types allowing you 🏿 to 💦 take 🖐📴 advantage of 🅱 them 👌👏 causing certain abilities to hit 🎵😪 a tick faster 🔥🔥

.tag:flanking
If 👏 your target is facing directly ➡➡ north, 💈💈 east, 🌍 south or west, flanking only 🏻 works 👔 from 👩 a 🚟 90° 💯❌ or 💁 greater 👅👅 angle.
If 😩 your 👏 target is 👍 facing any 💦 other ✉👨 direction, flanking works ♀👩 from a 90-(90-the ❌❌ amount of 💦😫 degrees your target is 👌📆 from facing 😫 where 🤔 you're standing)° 🏿 angle.
In ♂💗 the below picture, 📷 black is 👏 your target, red 🔴❤ is 💦😯 the 👏🍦 direction your target is 🈶 facing, and 😲➕ green 💸 is 🙅💯 where flanking works. ♀

> __**Freedom Autos (Courtesy of <@425520655920791553>)**__
.tag:freedom
Freedom is unique in 👈😤 the 👏 respect 🤷 that it can 🔫🔫 be 💪 used 🚟👨 to 💦 force an 🍑👏 offhand auto 🤖 as 🍑 well 😎 as 🏿🍑 a 🐙🦆 2h auto 🤖 within 🤞🎉 3t. This 👉 has many uses 🆒 like freedom vuln (using 🏻 vuln instead of the 💰 offhand auto 🤖🤖 loses less ➖ damage than 😻👄 if you were to do 👌👉 it 💯 in place 🏡🤤 of a 🔬 2h auto), 🤖🤖 as well as 🍑 accelerated adren gain because you 🚫 also ➕😒 get adren from 👉👉 2 😞💕 autos.

Mage: It's 😍 usually easier 😁😀 to time, and 🏻 also often beneficial to do 😍 it ➡♂ immediately after a 2h abil, as 🍑 this means 😠😏 the 👏🏽 2h auto 🤖🤖 comes at 😍😂 the 👏 same time 😤💯 as 🏿 your 👉👉 next 🌨💕 ability. 👉

You 🤜🚟 do the following:
```Tick 0: Activate abil with 👏👏 staff equipped
Tick 0-3: Equip dual 🔫🏏 wield
Tick 3: 😭🕑 Click auto 🤖🤖 → freedom (you don't 🚫 have to 💦 click 🖱🖱 the 💯 keybind for 💯👏 this auto 🤖🤖 if 🤔 you 😡♿ just 🏻 want 👨👏 a 🅱 regular 😶😶 auto). 🤖🤖
Tick 4-6: 💦🙇 Switch 🎚🎚 to 👀 staff
Tick 6: ❗❗ Click 🖱🖱 auto 🤖🤖 → abil```
.
You ☝👉 can 💦😉 see 👀 a clip of this ⬆⬇ here: 🛬⛄ https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk 😎
.
For 🍆 other styles you'll 😫🅱 need 🤔 to 💵💦 do it after 👊⏳ a ☠ dual 🏏 wield ability 👉👉 (or 💦 delay your 👀 ability 👉👉 afterwards but 🤔 this isn't worthwhile):
```Tick 0: ❕ Activate abil with 👏🎉 dual 🔫 wield equipped
Tick 3: ❤ Activate freedom
Tick 4: 🍆🏽 Equip 2h
Tick 6: 🕕🤘 Activate abil```
.
You 💬👈 can 🔫 see a clip of 📀💰 this here: 👉🈶 https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8 😮🤑
.
It's 🐸🙅 worth noting that if you're 👈 maging and freedom after a 👦 dual 🔫🔫 wield ability, 👉 to 👅 avoid 🙅 losing autos you 👈💻 have 👏😬 to 💦💦 do 🙂💯 a 🙀 dual 🏏 wield ability 👉 immediately 🤣👏 after 🏃🅰 as 👏🛠 well. 😨 Consider:
```any 💦💦 abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → dw abil → auto + staff abil
staff abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) 🤖🤖 → any abil → dw abil → auto 🤖 + staff abil```
If you 🤖 just 🏼👏 did 👌🙀 a 🅰👇 staff ability 👉 afterwards:
```staff abil → dw abil → freedom (oh 🍤🚟 + 2h auto) 🤖 → any 💦 abil → dw abil```
you'd ♀🏾 clearly lose an auto. 🤖🤖

You 👈 can also 🅱 use ❌ freedom to 💦 cancel ❌❌ a 💰😍 channelled ability. In order to 👨 do 👏 this you have 🈶 to 💦🏼 click 🖱 the 👉🤜 target on 🙏🏻 the 🎁👨 same 👭 tick you use 👏😂 freedom, or 💁🍆 you 👆 won't get the 👏 offhand auto 🤖🤖 off. 🤤 You 👉👌 also ➕☹ have 👏😋 to 😛 delay your 💃👨 subsequent ability 👉 by 1 tick in 😍 order 🎁❌ to 🙏 get your 👏 2h auto 🤖 off. 💦

.tag:defensiveautos
When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired. When using <:Magic:689504724159823906>, this auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>. This is done by pressing the keybind for <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>, followed by the keybind for <:freedom:535541258240786434>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:res:535541258844635148>, or <:prep:535541258546970624>.

During 🏃 the detonate channel, it is 🔥👏 possible to 💰💦 switch weapons without 👏🏻 Detonate being 🙄 released. 👁👅 It 👁🙀 is 🍏🚫 also 🙇 possible 🔝 to 💩🍅 channel 👀 shield 💦 dome inside 💠 detonate, provided detonate is 💦🕤 pressed first. This 🚷 will 💣 cost 💲👀 the 👩 auto 🤖🤖 on 🤣👀 detonate release, but is 💯🈶 situationally useful at Vorago.

In certain 🤔🤔 cases, 💼 most notably at Vorago, it is beneficial to 👮 be 👦💄 in 😉🍞 shield 💦💦 dome while 👱👱 channelling detonate. This 😂👈 is done 😤✅ by 👏 channelling detonate, then 💯👄 channelling shield 💦 dome. This 👈 will result in 🍌 a 👌🐶 lost 🍆😩 auto, 🤖🤖 but can be 🐝 prevented by sipping 🍾🍾 a 💰🏽 super 💢 restore or 👱💰 an 😤🌑 overload salve to 🌈💦 cancel ❌❌ the shield 💦 dome.

.tag:dbaxe
The 👏👏 Dragon 🐉 battleaxe has a 💰🏿 unique spec that 💵 is 💥👌 often used 🏭🚟 in speed kills ☠ due 👅👅 to 💦 providing a noticeable damage ☠☠ increase at the cost of 💰 a ⏰♥ large amount 🔢🔢 of adrenaline, 💉 therefore 👉👏 is 💦🅱 quite useful when 🍆 prepared before ⬅ hand 🙊 or in other niche situations.

The 🅱👏 Spec works 💦🤔 as 🅰 following, by 😈🍭 draining 10% 💯😂 (rounded down) 👇 of your 🏼 attack, 🤼🤼 range, 💦💦 magic, 📿📿 and 🙋👌 defence levels, 📊📊 you ♂ will 🤔 be 🎄❌ given ⤵⤴ a strength 💪👊 level boost of 10 🔟🔟 + 1 🏫 level for 😜👏 every 👏 4 😘 drained 📉📉 from 💋🙃 your other 🏿👪 stats, as well as 🅰🕓 a 👇💕 hidden damage ☠ boost of 👏 1.2x 📐 your damage, ☠☄ this 😱 also 🅱 stacks 💰 with 💰🅱 Zaros godsword spec going 💯 from 💰 a 1.25x to 💦 1.5x boost, or 💁 1.1x 📣 when ⏱ under the 👄🏼 effect of 💦 berserk, making berserk a 😎 2.2x damage ☠☄ boost. This 😰 boost overall lasts 1 minute. ⌚⏰

It’s 💦 most common 😍 uses 🆒🆒 are 👪♀ setup before 🐝 hand 🍆🏾 for a 👌 speed/record ⏩ kills 💀😵 where 👏 you will 🏻 Dragon battleaxe in conjunction with ♀ natural 👉 instinct to make the most 🥇💯 of the 👏👩 boost before ⬇ going 🏃 into the kill, 🔫⚰ or 🥖🅱 for an Araxxor p3 skip and 💰✔ certain 🤔 1 ♂🌸 cycle core 💰💰 Solak rotations.
