⬥ In order to prevent yourself from walking your Onslaught, simply hit an auto keybind before hitting your Onslaught keybind.
    • This will stop your movement and prevent you from walking and cancelling your Onslaught.

**__What Slow Abilities are:__**
⬥ In RS, there are some abilities whose damage will go through one tick after they are activated, and some abilities whose damage will be delayed.
    • The latter are known as slow abilities, and are worth being aware of.

⬥ Certain weapon types for Ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage with a 2H Cbow/Bow or DW Cbow to only take 1 tick to deal damage.
    • This depends on your distance from your target's SW tile.

⬥ Slow abilities which are unaffected by overrides include: Needle <:needle:535541259108876293>, Binding <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, and Tight Binding <:tight:535541275957657600>

.tag:faceposangle
**__Facing direction: Movement__**
⬥ While idle or in motion, the game determines the direction NPCs and PCs face depending on the previous tile.
⬥ Only 8 directions can be faced, regardless of what a NPC or PC model might look at.
    • The directions are North, North-east, East, South-east, South, South-west, West, North-west.
        - Each direction covers the span of 45°, starting at 22.5° north of hard east.

⬥ List of Each direction and the angles corresponding to it:
```
 North-east    :     22.5°  to  67.5°
 North         :     67.5°  to 112.5°
 North-west    :     112.5° to 157.5°
 West          :     157.5° to 202.5°
 South-west    :     202.5° to 247.5°
 South         :     247.5° to 292.5°
 South-east    :     292.5° to 337.5°
 1st-half-East :     337.5° to 360.0°
 2nd-half-East :     0.00°  to  22.5°
```
⬥ Bladed dive is affected by this significantly, read more below.

.
**__Facing direction: Targeting__**
⬥ The direction a boss faces will be the tile its target is stood on.
⬥ Players will face their target's center, if:
    • They acquire a new target by left clicking and Target Cycling.
    • Using any ability, spell or special attack.
    • For channelled abilities, when within range of the target, you will face your target; otherwise you will not cast the channel.
        - Melee channeled abilities behave differently, they will cast from any range you have on your target and deal damage along the way.

.
⬥ The image below explains NPC facing zones that are dependent on target movement.
    • Shark tiles are cardinal direction (North, South, West, East) tiles.
    • Lobster tiles are non-cardinal direction (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast) tiles.
    • Tile with a character in the middle is the NPC's Center tile.
    • Notice the offset in the SW region (bottom-left lobster pile).
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/6z5YGvX.png
.
**__Flanking Implications__**
⬥ Flanking can only activate if:
    • You are standing no more tiles in one direction relative to the center tile.
    • This direction is what the NPC is facing.

⬥ Walk-under flanking works because of these conditions being met.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/tvao5QX.png
.
⬥ In the above image, the boss is facing South, and your character is is stood in the same direction but further south. No flanking.
.
⬥ One exception occurs when your target is facing a non-cardinal direction:
    • If you can draw a straight line from your position to the NPC's
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/dkMhMtp.png
.
⬥ In the above image, the boss is facing North West, and your character is the same number of tiles away in the East/West direction. Flanking is possible.

.
> **__Bladed Dive__**
.tag:bd
**__Bladed Dive Angle__**
⬥ After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction.
    • It is important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive → Surge and move in a predictable manner.

⬥ See this graphic for more information (Courtesy of <@76883062381621248>):
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ODMwLfr.png
.
**__Bladed Dive AoE__**
⬥ The way in which Bladed Dive's AoE works is that when you BD onto a target it will move you to a position, and this position becomes the centre of the AoE.

⬥ The below graphic shows how Bladed Dive's AoE works.

> **__Freedom Autos__ (Courtesy of <@425520655920791553>)**
.tag:freedom
**__What Makes Freedom Unique__**
Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2h auto within 3t.

.
**__Uses due to this Property__**
1) Freedom Vuln: using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2h auto.
2) Accelerated adren gain because you also get adren from 2 autos.

.
**__How to use it__**
⬥ Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2h abil, as this means the 2h auto comes at the same time as your next ability.

⬥ You do the following:
```Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped
Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield
Tick 3: Click auto → freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto).
Tick 4-6: Switch to staff
Tick 6: Click auto → abil```
.
⬥ You can see a clip of this here:
.
https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk
.
⬥ For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile):
```Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped
Tick 3: Activate freedom
Tick 4: Equip 2h
Tick 6: Activate abil```
.
⬥ You can see a clip of this here:
.
https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8
.
⬥ It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider:
```any abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → dw abil → auto + staff abil
staff abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil → auto + staff abil```
⬥ If you just did a staff ability afterwards, you would clearly lose an auto:
```staff abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil```
⬥ You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability:
    • Click the target on the same tick you use freedom or you won't get the offhand auto off.
    • Delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2h auto off.

.
> **__Forcing an Auto with Defensives__**
.tag:defensiveautos
⬥ When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired if the auto is off cooldown.
⬥ This auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>.
    • This is done by pressing the keybind for <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>, followed by the keybind for <:freedom:535541258240786434>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:res:535541258844635148>, <:prep:535541258546970624>, and so on.

.tag:detoswitch
⬥ While charging Detonate, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released.
⬥ It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release.
.

.
> **__Shield Dome Detonate__**
.tag:detodome
⬥ It is also possible to channel shield dome inside Detonate, provided Detonate is pressed first.
    • This is done by charging Detonate, and then casting shield dome.
    • This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome.

.tag:dbaxe
**__What the Special Attack is__**
⬥ Special Attack: Rampage.
⬥ Adrenaline Cost: 100% (90% with <:RoV:513201065877831680>)

.
**__How it Works:__**
⬥ Drains 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels.
⬥ Multiplicative 10% reduction on your hit chance.
⬥ Gain strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 levels drained from your other stats.
⬥ Gain a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, lasting 1 minute. Stacks with:
    • Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost.
    • Berserk ability going from 2.0x to 2.2x boost making DBA a 1.1x instead of 1.2x damage boost.

.
**__When is it Used:__**
⬥ Accuracy debuff is not detrimental.
⬥ Enough downtime to reobtain your full adren bar. Downtime includes:
    • Time where you cant deal any damage at all (ex: Taraket intermission phases).
    • Time where the damage you do is not priority damage (ex: The Ambassador spinners).
⬥ Speed Kills: at adrenaline crystal in War's Retreat (PvM Hub).

.
> **__Back-to-Back Special Attacks__ (Courtesy of <@150284127126552576>)**
.tag:b2bSpec
__**How It Works**__
Doing b2b (or more) specs seems to follow a pattern of [X tick loss, Y tick loss] of every b2b [odd, even] spec, as shown in the following table:
```
Ability before spec spamming:
Fast/Fastest Ability → no tick loss, no tick loss
Average Ability → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Slowest Ability → no tick loss, 7 tick loss

Auto before spec spamming:
Fastest Auto → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Fast Auto → no tick loss, 2 tick loss
Average Auto → no tick loss, 3 tick loss
Slowest Auto → no tick loss, 9 tick loss
```
*Note: These tests were done using non-channeled abilities and special attacks, interactions with channeled abilities and special attacks still need to be documented*

.
**__In Other Words**
⬥ Your first special attack in a chain will always be fine.
⬥ The second special attack can be delayed based on the weapon speed used to cast the ability or auto before the first special.

.
**__Examples__**
⬥ (fastest) <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184>
