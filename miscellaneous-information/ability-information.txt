.tag:faceposangle
**__Facing direction: Movement__**
⬥ While idle or in motion, the game determines the direction NPCs and PCs face depending on the previous tile.
⬥ Only 8 directions can be faced, regardless of what a NPC or PC model might look at.
    • The directions are North, North-east, East, South-east, South, South-west, West, North-west.
        - Each direction covers the span of 45°, starting at 22.5° north of hard east.

⬥ List of Each direction and the angles corresponding to it:
```
 North-east    :     22.5°  to  67.5°
 North         :     67.5°  to 112.5°
 North-west    :     112.5° to 157.5°
 West          :     157.5° to 202.5°
 South-west    :     202.5° to 247.5°
 South         :     247.5° to 292.5°
 South-east    :     292.5° to 337.5°
 1st-half-East :     337.5° to 360.0°
 2nd-half-East :     0.00°  to  22.5°
```
⬥ Bladed dive is affected by this significantly, read more below.

.
**__Facing direction: Targeting__**
⬥ The direction a boss faces will be the tile its target is stood on.
⬥ Players will face their target's center, if:
    • They acquire a new target by left clicking and Target Cycling.
    • Using any ability, spell or special attack.
    • For channelled abilities, when within range of the target, you will face your target; otherwise you will not cast the channel.
        - Melee channeled abilities behave differently, they will cast from any range you have on your target and deal damage along the way.

.
⬥ The image below explains NPC facing zones that are dependent on target movement.
    • Shark tiles are cardinal direction (North, South, West, East) tiles.
    • Lobster tiles are non-cardinal direction (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, Southeast) tiles.
    • Tile with a character in the middle is the NPC's Center tile.
    • Notice the offset in the SW region (bottom-left lobster pile).
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/6z5YGvX.png
.
**__Flanking Implications__**
⬥ Flanking can only activate if:
    • You are standing no more tiles in one direction relative to the center tile.
    • This direction is what the NPC is facing.

⬥ Walk-under flanking works because of these conditions being met.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/tvao5QX.png
.
⬥ In the above image, the boss is facing South, and your character is is stood in the same direction but further south. No flanking.
.
⬥ One exception occurs when your target is facing a non-cardinal direction:
    • If you can draw a straight line from your position to the NPC's
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/dkMhMtp.png
.
⬥ In the above image, the boss is facing North West, and your character is the same number of tiles away in the East/West direction. Flanking is possible.

.
> **__Bladed Dive__**
.tag:bd
**__Bladed Dive Angle__**
⬥ After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction.
    • It is important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive → Surge and move in a predictable manner.

⬥ See this graphic for more information (Courtesy of <@76883062381621248>):
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ODMwLfr.png
.
**__Bladed Dive AoE__**
⬥ The way in which Bladed Dive's AoE works is that when you BD onto a target it will move you to a position, and this position becomes the centre of the AoE.

⬥ The below graphic shows how Bladed Dive's AoE works.

> **__Freedom Autos__ (Courtesy of <@425520655920791553>)**
.tag:freedom
**__What Makes Freedom Unique__**
Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2H auto within 3t.

.
**__Uses due to this Property__**
1) Freedom Vuln: using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2H auto.
2) Accelerated adren gain because you also get adren from 2 autos.

.
**__How to use it__**
⬥ Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2H abil, as this means the 2H auto comes at the same time as your next ability.

⬥ You do the following:
```Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped
Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield
Tick 3: Click auto → freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto).
Tick 4-6: Switch to staff
Tick 6: Click auto → abil```
.
⬥ You can see a clip of this here:
.
https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk
.
⬥ For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile):
```Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped
Tick 3: Activate freedom
Tick 4: Equip 2H
Tick 6: Activate abil```
.
⬥ You can see a clip of this here:
.
https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8
.
⬥ It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider:
```any abil → DW abil → freedom (oh + 2H auto) → DW abil → auto + staff abil
staff abil → freedom (oh + 2H auto) → any abil → DW abil → auto + staff abil```
⬥ If you just did a staff ability afterwards, you would clearly lose an auto:
```staff abil → DW abil → freedom (oh + 2H auto) → any abil → DW abil```
⬥ You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability:
    • Click the target on the same tick you use freedom or you won't get the offhand auto off.
    • Delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2H auto off.

.
> **__Forcing an Auto with Defensives__**
.tag:defensiveautos
⬥ When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired if the auto is off cooldown.
⬥ This auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>.
    • This is done by pressing the keybind for <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>, followed by the keybind for <:freedom:535541258240786434>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:res:535541258844635148>, <:prep:535541258546970624>, and so on.

.tag:detoswitch
⬥ While charging Detonate, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released.
⬥ It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release.
.

.
> **__Shield Dome Detonate__**
.tag:detodome
⬥ It is also possible to channel shield dome inside Detonate, provided Detonate is pressed first.
    • This is done by charging Detonate, and then casting shield dome.
    • This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome.

**__What the Special Attack is__**
⬥ Special Attack: Rampage.
⬥ Adrenaline Cost: 100% (90% with <:RoV:513201065877831680>)

.
**__How it Works:__**
⬥ Drains 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels.
⬥ Multiplicative 10% reduction on your hit chance.
⬥ Gain strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 levels drained from your other stats.
⬥ Gain a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, lasting 1 minute. Stacks with:
    • Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost.
    • Berserk ability going from 2.0x to 2.2x boost making DBA a 1.1x instead of 1.2x damage boost.

.
**__When is it Used:__**
⬥ Accuracy debuff is not detrimental.
⬥ Enough downtime to reobtain your full adren bar. Downtime includes:
    • Time where you cant deal any damage at all (ex: Taraket intermission phases).
    • Time where the damage you do is not priority damage (ex: The Ambassador spinners).
⬥ Speed Kills: at adrenaline crystal in War's Retreat (PvM Hub).

.
> **__Back-to-Back Special Attacks__ (Courtesy of <@150284127126552576>)**
.tag:b2bSpec
__**How It Works**__
Doing b2b (or more) specs seems to follow a pattern of [X tick loss, Y tick loss] of every b2b [odd, even] spec, as shown in the following table:
```
Ability before spec spamming:
Fast/Fastest Ability → no tick loss, no tick loss
Average Ability → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Slowest Ability → no tick loss, 7 tick loss

Auto before spec spamming:
Fastest Auto → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Fast Auto → no tick loss, 2 tick loss
Average Auto → no tick loss, 3 tick loss
Slowest Auto → no tick loss, 9 tick loss
```
*Note: These tests were done using non-channeled abilities and special attacks, interactions with channeled abilities and special attacks still need to be documented*

.
**__In Other Words__**
⬥ Your first special attack in a chain will always be fine.
⬥ The second special attack can be delayed based on the weapon speed used to cast the ability or auto before the first special.

.
**__Examples__**
⬥ (fastest) <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184>

    • This has no delays.

⬥ (average) <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> → (average) <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • This results in a delay on the 2nd <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:eofspec:746403211908481184> because of the average speed <:dbreath:535533833391702017>

.
**__Barricade__** <:cade:535541306353778689>
⬥ Adrenaline Cost: 100% (90% with <:RoV:513201065877831680>, 80% with <:RoV:513201065877831680> + <:conservationofenergy:697808773711921195>)
⬥ Barricade is an ultimate defensive ability that requires a shield or defender to activate. While activated, the user is immune to all damage, all typeless (both soft and hard), unless the player receives an attack that disables defensives.
⬥ It does not prevent stuns, but the damage associated with the stunning attacks are negated.
⬥ The amount of time barricade is active scales with the level of the shield or defender equipped; this duration ranges from 4.8 seconds (8 game ticks) with a level 1 shield to 10.2 seconds (17 game ticks) with a level 90 shield. For every 10 levels of shield, one extra tick is added to the duration.

**__Barricade duration extenders__**
⬥ The Turtling perk extends the duration of this ability in exchange for increasing its cooldown by 10% per rank, up to a 13.8 second duration and a 84 second cooldown.
⬥ The Malletops perk from the Anachronia Dinosaur Farm extends the duration of Barricade by 1.8 seconds per tier, and stacks with the Turtling perk, offering an additional 3.6 seconds at the maximum tier of 2. Activating this requires a Farming level of 117 and two large dinosaur pens with at least one elder Malletops each. Both these pens should have a farm totem on them.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/WTo9R5O.png
.
**__Additional Notes__**
⬥ If activated with a defender, the defender's level in regard to calculating Barricade's duration is halved. For example, the Kalphite defender is a level 90 defender but acts like a level 45 shield and it is the level 45 that is used to determine the length of Barricade's duration.
⬥ If the shield or defender is unequipped or switched to a different shield or defender (even to a second copy of the same item) while Barricade is still active, the ability is cancelled immediately.
