In order to prevent yourself from walking your Onslaught, simply hit an auto keybind before hitting your Onslaught keybind. This will stop your movement and prevent you from walking and cancelling your Onslaught.

In RS, there are some abilities whose damage will go through one tick after they are activated, and some abilities whose damage will be delayed. The latter are known as slow abilities, and are worth being aware of.

Certain weapon types for Ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage with a 2H Cbow/Bow or DW Cbow to only take 1 tick to deal damage depending on your distance from your target's true centre instead. Slow abilities which are unaffected by overrides include: Needle <:needle:535541259108876293>, Binding <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, and Tight Binding <:tight:535541275957657600>

> **__Flanking Perk Angle Determination__ (Courtesy of <@!242039053841596418>)**
.tag:flanking
If your target is facing directly north, east, south or west, flanking only works from a 90° or greater angle.
If your target is facing any other direction, flanking works from a 90-(90-the amount of degrees your target is from facing where you're standing)° angle.
In the below picture, black is your target, red is the direction your target is facing, and green is where flanking works.

> **__Freedom Autos__ (Courtesy of <@425520655920791553>)**
.tag:freedom
Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2h auto within 3t. This has many uses like freedom vuln (using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2h auto), as well as accelerated adren gain because you also get adren from 2 autos.

Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2h abil, as this means the 2h auto comes at the same time as your next ability.

You do the following:
```Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped
Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield
Tick 3: Click auto → freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto).
Tick 4-6: Switch to staff
Tick 6: Click auto → abil```
.
You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk
.
For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile):
```Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped
Tick 3: Activate freedom
Tick 4: Equip 2h
Tick 6: Activate abil```
.
You can see a clip of this here:
https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8
.
It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider:
```any abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → dw abil → auto + staff abil
staff abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil → auto + staff abil```
If you just did a staff ability afterwards:
```staff abil → dw abil → freedom (oh + 2h auto) → any abil → dw abil```
you'd clearly lose an auto.

You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability. In order to do this you have to click the target on the same tick you use freedom, or you won't get the offhand auto off. You also have to delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2h auto off.

.
> **__Forcing an Auto with Defensives__**
.tag:defensiveautos
When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired. When using <:Magic:689504724159823906>, this auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>. This is done by pressing the keybind for <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or <:ent:567727987274022924>, followed by the keybind for <:freedom:535541258240786434>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:res:535541258844635148>, or <:prep:535541258546970624>.

> **__Switching Weapons during Detonate__ (Courtesy of <@185315527571406848>)**
.tag:detoswitch
During the detonate channel, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released. It is also possible to channel shield dome inside detonate, provided detonate is pressed first. This will cost the auto on detonate release, but is situationally useful at Vorago. It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release.

.
> **__Shield Dome Detonate__**
.tag:detodome
In certain cases, most notably at Vorago, it is beneficial to be in shield dome while channelling detonate. This is done by channelling detonate, then channelling shield dome. This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome.

.
> **__Dragon Battleaxe Spec__**
.tag:dbaxe
The Dragon battleaxe has a unique spec that is often used in speed kills due to providing a noticeable damage increase at the cost of a large amount of adrenaline, therefore is quite useful when prepared before hand or in other niche situations.

The Spec works as following, by draining 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels, you will be given a strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 drained from your other stats, as well as a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, this also stacks with Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost, or 1.1x when under the effect of berserk, making berserk a 2.2x damage boost. This boost overall lasts 1 minute.

It’s most common uses are setup before hand for a speed/record kills where you will Dragon battleaxe in conjunction with natural instinct to make the most of the boost before going into the kill, or for an Araxxor p3 skip and certain 1 cycle core Solak rotations.

.
> **__Bladed Dive__**
.tag:bd
__**Bladed Dive Angle**__
After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction. It's important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive → Surge and move in a predictable manner. See this graphic for more information (Courtesy of <@76883062381621248>):

.
__**Bladed Dive AoE**__
The way in which Bladed Dive's AoE works is that when you BD onto a target it will move you to a position, and this position becomes the center of the AoE as shown in the following graphic:

.
> **__Back-to-Back Special Attacks__ (Courtesy of <@150284127126552576>)**
.tag:b2bSpec
**__How It Works__**
Doing b2b (or more) specs seems to follow a pattern of [X tick loss, Y tick loss] of every b2b [odd, even] spec, as shown in the following table:
```
Ability before spec spamming:
Fast/Fastest Ability → no tick loss, no tick loss
Average Ability → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Slowest Ability → no tick loss, 7 tick loss

Auto before spec spamming:
Fastest Auto → no tick loss, 1 tick loss
Fast Auto → no tick loss, 2 tick loss
Average Auto → no tick loss, 3 tick loss
Slowest Auto → no tick loss, 9 tick loss
```
*Note: these tests were done using non-channeled abilities and special attacks, interactions with channeled abilities and special attacks still need to be documented.*

.
**__In Other Words__**
Your first special attack in a chain will always be fine; however, the second special attack can be delayed based on the weapon speed used to cast the ability or auto before the first special.

.
**__Examples__**
