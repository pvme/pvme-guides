> __**Introduction**__
Nex is the Zarosian general in the God Wars dungeon.

When Nex spawns for the first time in a custom instance it will be praying against mage for the majority of the kill, this is why range only kills are the meta for fast consistent kills. After every kill you will teleport out of the instance and re-enter in order to force Nex to always be praying mage.

Nex is a 1x1 NPC and has very strict softcaps, which means that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase. During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above **5,000 by 50%**. For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage. On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above **2,000 by 75%**. This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000.

.
Nex's mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%. Each mage is combat level 111 with 10,000 health, possesses a max hit of around 850, and are weak to bolts. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name. An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks. Cruor's attacks always have 100% accuracy and will heal him for 100 damage regardless of the damage he deals, while Glacies' attacks can freeze players if they aren't using Protect/Deflect Magic; keeping the prayer active will result in all of her attacks missing regardless of the player's armour rating.

*It is strongly advised to complete the Ritual of the Mahjarrat quest in order to get access to the Jas boost which gives a 5% damage boost in GWD1 (including Nex). This can be done via Fairy ring code D.K.Q.*

.tag:presets
**__Banking Preset__**
⬥ The most important thing is to have a Frozen key + ancient ceremonial for use with your boss portal.
⬥ An Enhanced Luck Potion <:luckpotion:656426717295935500> works and can be used here.
⬥ You can speak to Ashuelot Reis in the Nex bank and pay a one time cost of the Frozen key + Ancient Ceremonial along with 10M GP to be able to access Nex bank without these items.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ Throw your Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> at start and on Blood phase. 
⬥ Akrisae body has Clear Headed 4 <:ch4:712073087864012840>, and is used to build with Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> at the start. 
⬥ This method relies on ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> procs on Nex. However, around Ice phase, ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> procs start to hit less than the ability they are replacing, so it’s optimal to bring a bolt switch. It is generally preferred to camp ruby <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> until ice phase, then switch to dragonstone bolts <:DragonstoneBakri:565726489144852511>.

> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
Nex has 5 phases; Smoke, Shadow, Blood, Ice, and Zaros. Each phase has 2 special attacks, with the exception of Zaros

__**Smoke Phase**__
Virus → 5 auto-attacks → No escape → Five auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Don't stand in middle crossways

__**Shadow Phase**__
Shadow traps (only if the phased before the virus attack) → Darkness → Shadow traps → 4 auto-attacks → Repeats from the second set of shadow traps
⬥ Move from shadows and don’t stand MD.

.
__**Blood Phase**__
Siphon summon → 3 auto-attacks → Blood sacrifice → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Attacks during Siphon will heal Nex and sacrifice will heal Nex if not phased and in range.
⬥ Any bleeds used during this phase will heal Nex rather than damage her ( <:frag:535541273755385885> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> <:deadshot:535541307666595870> )

__**Ice Phase**__
First special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Second special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ If Blood phase ended with Sacrifice, Ice will start with Contain
⬥ If Blood phase ended with Siphon, Ice will start with Prison
⬥ Run from Contain and Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> into eating up then <:vitality:654618235097972737>.

.
__**Zaros Phase**__
⬥ Upon the start of this phase, Nex activates Turmoil and heals herself for 33,333 (1/6) of her health to boost it up to 73,333.
⬥ Nex does not have any unique special attacks in this phase and uses only her melee and magic autoattacks

**__Pre-Fight__**
Target Fumus ASAP and start building adrenaline with defensives. Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> should be first, and Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> should be last.

.tag:noxbowrotations
*Note: Make sure to use Jas Boost*
.
**__What to Expect__**
This method can achieve around 1:50-2:00 kills optimally. Even with scuffed kills you can average 2:20-2:30. Nex has an attack range of 8 spaces, while Nox Bow has a range of 9, so you can always force Nex to walk frags and delay attacks depending on where you stand. Review the position indicators at the bottom of this guide to see where to stand while phasing. 

Use <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:grico:787904334812807238> + basics as needed to phase minions.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ Stalker ring adds 3% crit chance when using bows and makes kills more consistent. Switch to Ring of Vigour when using <:dbow:643848618553507843><:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
⬥ Adrenaline renewal can be used at cruor/before ice phase, but improvise as needed.

**__Smoke Phase__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/S5MyZhb.png
.
Stand on the west side, once she’s phased click on Fumus and after you Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into Fumus and make your way over to the north-western safespot, by the time she’s able to attack you Fumus should be low HP or dead depending on if you got any procs. Try and run her if she’s close to surging through the middle.

.
**__Shadow Phase__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/3qo51kq.png
.
During shadow make your way over to the north-eastern safespot, one method is to phase her on the northern side then once she is phased make your way to the north-eastern safe spot whilst you're killing Umbra so you're not stuck taking shadow bleed damage at the safe spot for long. 

Once phased, try to stay MD/ 2 squares away from Nex so she can reach you instantly and begin siphoning.

.
**__Blood Phase__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/GYKu8TG.png
.
During her siphon, make your way over to the eastern safe spot whilst staying at an even number of squares so that if she does run to you, she won’t run underneath you which could delay her attacks which could mean she won’t sacrifice if everything lines up poorly. At the eastern safespot you can click Cruor during your Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and it won’t switch unless your ability ends or Nex phases. 

After she is phased, make your way over to the south-eastern safespot so she will follow you, allowing no tick loss during the transition from Blood to Ice as you’ll want to be MD to Glacies during the beginning of Ice.

.
**__Ice Phase__**:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/5XQ3Dr0.png
.
Once Cruor is dead, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to Glacies and stand MD to her.

**__Zaros Phase__**
Try not to run Nex too much whilst your book is off cooldown.

.
**__Smoke Phase Notes__**
⬥ Throw your bomb right <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> before the kill is about to start.
⬥ Make sure to Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> with Ascensions so that there's a chance to proc the Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> effect.
⬥ If the boss doesn't phase, follow up with <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088>, and run the boss while you do so.
⬥ Both bleeds then good basics on the minion.

.
**__Shadow Phase Notes__** 
⬥ If you proc a Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> during Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> into Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> without Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> .
⬥ Reprisal isn't necessary <:Reprisal:513190159462694912>, but makes it easier when you don't get a Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> proc.
⬥ Both bleeds and good basics on the minion.

.
**__Blood Phase Notes__**
⬥ Be sure to let her Sacrifice so you get a contain first on Ice phase
⬥ In rare cases it is possible to have to your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> in order to use Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>. In this case you will need to improvise your Zaros rotation.
⬥ Both bleeds and good basics on Cruor. If Nex is MDing you, it's worth it to run her to stall autos, but don't worry too much if she does another Siphon before you can phase.
⬥ Practice your Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> timing so that it hits right when Nex is attackable, rather than healing her. You can snipe when her Wings go up a 3rd time.
.

.
**__Ice Phase Notes__**
⬥ If you get prisoned before targeting Glacies you can target cycle to attack him.

.
**__Zaros Phase Notes__**
⬥ Disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> may be used if you are low on food.
⬥ You can run Nex if low on food, but don't need to (and will end up walking book procs). It's optimal to do so if you notice her SS is active.
