> **__Introduction__**
When Nex spawns for the first time in a custom instance it will be praying Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> for the majority of the kill, this is why Range only kills are the meta for fast consistent kills. After every kill you will teleport out of the instance and re-enter in order to force Nex to always be praying Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>

*Note: It is strongly advised to complete the Ritual of the Mahjarrat quest in order to get access to the Jas boost which gives a 5% damage boost in GWD1 (including Nex). This can be done via Fairy ring code D.K.Q.*

**__Banking Preset__**
⬥ The most important thing is to have a Frozen key + Ancient Ceremonial set for use with your boss portal.
    • You can speak to Ashuelot Reis in the Nex bank and pay a one time cost of the Frozen key + Ancient Ceremonial along with 10M GP to be able to access Nex bank without these items.
⬥ An Enhanced Luck Potion <:luckpotion:656426717295935500> works and can be used here.
⬥ A T70+ Defender is required for Ancient Emblem <:ancientemblem:643506778453049355> drops

.tag:mechanics
**__Nex overview__**
⬥ Nex is a 1x1 NPC and has very strict softcaps, which means that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase.
    • During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above **5,000 by 50%**.
        - For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage.
    • On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above **2,000 by 75%**.
        - This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000.

**__Mages overview__**
⬥ Mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%.
⬥ Each mage is combat level 111 with 10,000 health, possesses a max hit of around 850, and are weak to bolts. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name.
⬥ An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks.

Nex has 5 phases; Smoke, Shadow, Blood, Ice, and Zaros. Each phase has 2 special attacks, with the exception of Zaros

.
__**Smoke Phase**__
Virus → 5 auto-attacks → No escape → Five auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Don't stand in middle crossways
.
.img:https://imgur.com/BgsPoty.mp4
.
⬥ Nex may drag you to MD of her at random times, nulling all damage sent to her during this timeframe.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/0tauAFe.mp4
.
__**Shadow Phase**__
Shadow traps (only if the phased before the virus attack) → Darkness → Shadow traps → 4 auto-attacks → Repeats from the second set of shadow traps
⬥ Move from Shadows and don’t stand MD.

*A shadow trap is avoided*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/FZJq76Y.mp4
.
*A player escapes the shadows engulfing them*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4cZwRUJ.mp4
.
__**Blood Phase**__
Siphon summon → 3 auto-attacks → Blood sacrifice → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Attacks during Siphon will heal Nex and sacrifice will heal Nex if not phased and in range.

*Nex summoning her Blood Reavers*
.

*Nex sacrifices a player*

⬥ Any bleeds used during this phase will heal Nex rather than damage her ( <:frag:535541273755385885> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> <:deadshot:535541307666595870> )
⬥ Cruor's attacks always have 100% accuracy and will heal him for 100 damage regardless of the damage he deals.

__**Ice Phase**__
First special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Second special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ If Blood phase ended with Sacrifice, Ice will start with Contain
.
.img:https://imgur.com/zFmdn67.mp4
.
⬥ If Blood phase ended with Siphon, Ice will start with Prison
.
.img:https://imgur.com/YGkCP6F.mp4
.
⬥ Run from Contain and Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> into eating up then <:vitality:654618235097972737>.
⬥ Glacies' attacks can freeze players if they aren't using Protect/Deflect Magic; keeping the prayer active will result in all of her attacks missing regardless of the player's armour rating.

.
__**Zaros Phase**__
⬥ Upon the start of this phase, Nex activates Turmoil <:turmoil:583429936606347280>and heals herself for 33,333 (1/6) of her health to boost it up to 73,333.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/lPTF0V0.mp4
.
⬥ Nex does not have any unique special attacks in this phase and uses only her melee and magic autoattacks

⬥ After you <:grico:787904334812807238> a minion wait a tick before prephasing Nex
⬥ If you get a Book Proc or you premine Fumus you can prephase Nex a tick earlier

**__Smoke Phase Notes__**
⬥ Throw your bomb right <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> before the kill is about to start.
⬥ If Nex tries to MD you earlier you can walk around the corner to prevent her underwalking you

**__Shadow Phase Notes__**
⬥ If you <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> around 136k you won't need to use <:snipe:535541258425204770> / <:mds:535541259033378827>

.
**__Blood Phase Notes__**
⬥ Be sure to let her Sacrifice so you get a contain first on Ice phase
⬥ In rare cases it is possible to have to your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> in order to use Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>. In this case you will need to improvise your Zaros rotation.
⬥ Practice your Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> timing so that it hits right when Nex is attackable, rather than healing her. You can snipe when her Wings go up a 3rd time.
.

**__Ice Phase Notes__**
⬥ If you get prisoned before targeting Glacies you can target cycle to attack him.
⬥ If you <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> around 56k you won't need to use <:mds:535541259033378827>

.
**__Zaros Phase Notes__**
⬥ Disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> may be used if you are low on food.
⬥ You can run Nex if low on food, but don't need to (and will end up walking book procs). It's optimal to do so if you notice her SS is active.

.tag:example
This is a sample 31 kill hour using the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> and its special attack. Kills following this rotation should average out at around sub 1:30. You can also use this as a visual guide for movement during the kill.
