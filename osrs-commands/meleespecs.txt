    "description": "⬥ When speccing, always use the melee style with the highest **Attack bonus**\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• **I.e. do __not__ change based of target's weaknesses / resistances**\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• What defence stat this rolls against is fixed and based off the spec itself\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• So, if Stab is your most accurate melee style, spec with Stab selected\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
