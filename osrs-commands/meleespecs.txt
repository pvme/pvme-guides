    "description": "⬥ What defence stat spec rolls against is fixed based on the spec itself\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• So just use the style (Crush / Stab / Slash) with highest **Attack Bonus**\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-  **I.e. do __not__ change based on target's weaknesses / resistances**\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-  E.g., if Stab is has the highest Attack Bonus, spec with Stab selected\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Can be a DPS loss if done incorrectly (i.e. forget to change style back)",
