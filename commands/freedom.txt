Freedom, unlike other defensives, allows you to get both an off-hand and 2h auto. To do this, you must freedom with your dual-wield on to get the off-hand auto, then swap to your 2h after.

You will always get the off-hand auto as you cast freedom, the 2h auto will follow normal auto rules.

If you wish to change the off-hand auto, you must do Auto → Freedom in the same tick, if you wish to change the 2h auto you must do Auto → Ability at the same time at the end of the GCD.

Common issues involved with changing the 2h auto occur when you cast an ability before freedom with a faster than average speed weapon, to fix this simply off after casting freedom and getting your off hand auto, and then do your Auto + Ability input at the end of the GCD.
