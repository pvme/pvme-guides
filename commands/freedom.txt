**__Why is Freedom Different__**
Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>, unlike other defensives, allows you to get both an off-hand and 2H auto. To do this, you must <:freedom:535541258240786434> with your dual-wield on to get the off-hand auto, then swap to your 2H after.

You will always get the off-hand auto as you cast <:freedom:535541258240786434>, the 2H auto will follow normal auto rules which are discussed in <#848333214589911040>.

**__How to Change the Autos Cast__**
If you wish to change the off-hand auto, you must do Auto → Freedom in the same tick. If you wish to change the 2H auto, you must do Auto → Ability at the same time at the end of the GCD.

**__Common Issues with Changing the 2H Auto__**
Common issues involved with changing the 2H auto occur when you cast an ability before <:freedom:535541258240786434> with a faster-than-average speed weapon, to fix this simply off after casting <:freedom:535541258240786434> and getting your off hand auto, and then do your Auto + Ability input at the end of the GCD.
