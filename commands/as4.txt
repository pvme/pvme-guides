__**Other considerations**__
⬥ <:as4:712074245202772009> <:eq2:689502258424971564> perks are BiS, and won't need to be replaced later on when you get more GP.
⬥ To get the full chance at <:as4:712074245202772009> <:eq2:689502258424971564> perks, you do need 120 Invention and Extreme Invention potions.  It is probably better to wait until 120 before going for this perk.

__**What scenarios would justify going for a plain <:as4:712074245202772009>?**__
⬥ If you are very low Invention level **and** won't be training Invention anytime soon **and** you want perks better than <:p6:712073088769982475> + <:eq4:712073088589627505> immediately **and** you have money to waste.
⬥ If you already have **all** of your <:as4:712074245202772009> <:eq2:689502258424971564> gizmos and want to perk out a weapon switch such as Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554>
