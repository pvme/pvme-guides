> __**Why you should almost never go for Aftershock4 (AS4) alone.**__

__**Cost Comparison**__
Aftershock4Equilibrium2 (AS4E2 ) costs 3.3x as much as AS4.  However, on a *per attempt* basis, AS4E2 and AS4 cost practically the same amount of 6 ilujankan components and 1 Ancient weapon gizmo.

__**Damage Gain Comparison**__
To compare how much of a damage increase each of these perks are, let's assume you start out with Precise6 Equilibrium4 weapon perks.

**If you make 1 attempt as As4 alone**
⬥ 96.3% chance of As4.  As4 is a 1.5% DPM boost over E4
⬥ 3.7% chance of As3.
⬥ **On average you will get a 1.44% DPM boost from an As4 attempt.**

**If you make 1 attempt at As4E2**
⬥ 84.6% chance of some kind of AS4.
    • 29.6% chance of AS4E2.  This is a 2.9% DPM boost compared to E4.
    • 36.4% chance of AS4R1.  With 0 ruthless stacks, this is a 1.5% DPM boost.  With 5 ruthless stacks, this is a 3.5% DPM boost.  Let's just assume that you have 5 ruthless stacks 10% of the time.  On average that would make this perk a 1.7% DPM boost.
    • 18.7% chance of plain AS4.  This is a 1.5% DPM boost.
⬥ 3.9% chance of getting some form of AS3.
⬥ **On average you will get a 1.77% DPM boost from an AS4E2 attempt.**  This is the main reason why it is better to go for AS4E2 attempts rather than AS4.

.
__**Other considerations**__
⬥ AS4E2 perks are BIS, and won't need to be replaced later on when you get more gp.
⬥To get the full chance at AS4E2 perks, you do need 120 Invention and Extreme Invention potions.  It is probably better to wait until 120 before going for AS4E2. 

__**What scenarios would justify going for a plain As4?**__
⬥ If you are very low Invention level AND won't be training Invention anytime soon **and** you want perks better than P6E4 immediately **and** you have money to waste
⬥ If you already have **all** of your AS4E2 gizmos and want to perk out a weapon switch such as Masterwork Spear of Annihilation.
