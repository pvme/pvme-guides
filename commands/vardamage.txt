        "value": "⬥ Var damage applies **only** to the damage **range** of abilities, rather than applying that percentage of a boost to what the ability would do after rolling.\n⬥ Damage boosts that can sound significant can prove not as impactful as ability damage ranges become smaller. Example below."

        "name": "__Why this matters for Necromancy__",
        "value": "⬥ Being aware of var damage boosts matters especially for Necromancy because all of Necromancy's abilities have extremely small damage ranges.\n⬥ For example, something like the Necromancy auto <:necroauto:1137809137401602109> has a 90%-110% damage range. A 10% **var** damage boost would turn that into a 90%-112%, only increasing the average damage from 100% to 101%.\n⬥ Compared to that same boost being used on Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>, wrack has a 40%-140% damage range, so a 10% var boost turns that into a 40%-150%. Increasing the average damage from 90% to 95%.\n⬥ In conclusion, something advertised as a 10% damage boost is in reality a 1% boost to <:necroauto:1137809137401602109> and a 5.5% boost to <:wrack:856662355952795658> when it is a var boost."
