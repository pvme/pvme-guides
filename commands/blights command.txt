**__Tl;dr: Cost does not outweight the setback and gains__**

Blightbounds are low priority as the cost for the slight tier increase over ascensions does not matter as much due to your primary damage output coming as a result of Bakriminal Bolts.

Further, buying Blightbounds sets you back on more important upgrades such as Eldritch Crossbow, Seren Godbow, and Greater Ricochet.
