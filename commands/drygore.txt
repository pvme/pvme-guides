**__Tl;dr: 99% of the time MH Mace, OH Non-Mace__** <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>

This text of information will be prefaced by saying that ***all*** Drygore weaponry does the same ability damage, and the differences in choices occur due to other properties they have, such as side-effects due to their weapon speeds.

Assuming you camp dual-wield, then it largely does not matter - though you should ideally pick up a MH Non-Mace <:drygorelongmh:513190158900658180> due to higher auto damage, which you will make use of as you Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> assuming you are not going to use Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.

However, when it comes to juggling (i.e., making use of both 2H and dual-wield weaponry), the choice is a bit more important:
⬥ You want a MH Mace <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902>, due to its fastest weapon speed:
    • This allows you to 5-tick Auto Attack (5TAA) if need be.
        - This naturally also allows the ability to 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA) spells such as Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> if needed too.
⬥ You also want an OH non-Mace <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>, due to its fast weapon speed:
    • This results in your offhand auto damage in being a bit higher, which only sees use when you Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.

That being said, there are also cases where you may want to choose a mainhand based on being able to exploit weaknesses (e.g., Drygore Rapier for the Rex Matriarch Rathis), but these are more niche, the above is more general.

To reiterate, outside of these other properties, Drygore weapons are all the same, and will do the same damage for your abilities. So, when it comes to switches it does not matter what you pick.
