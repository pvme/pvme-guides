As such, it has excellent synergy with the Instability special attack: each one of the 8 hits **can** crit. You should generally aim to use the ability **twice** within each FSOA spec. Exactly where the ability is placed in the rotation is variable. Generally one will be used either directly preceding or just after the start of the spec, with the other being used towards the middle of the spec during your threshold usage and adren dumping. Overall, the ability both provides an immense amount of damage on its own and provides you with more consistent adrenaline gain throughout the entire rotation."
