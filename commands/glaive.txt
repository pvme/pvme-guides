**__Glaive Bug__**
Glaive offhand, unless paired with its mainhand, has -13 ability damage (i.e., less damage) compared to an offhand Chaotic Crossbow.

Despite the offhand Glaive accuracy being higher, this only affects offhand autos, and so is not really an issue.

Therefore, Chaotic offhand > Glaive offhand.
