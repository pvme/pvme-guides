**__Glaive Bug__**
Glaive offhand, unless paired with its mainhand, has -13 AD (i.e., less damage) compared to an offhand Chaotic Crossbow.

Despite the offhand Glaive accuracy being higher, this only affects offhand autos, and so is not really an issue.

Therefore, Chaotic offhand > Glaive offhand.
