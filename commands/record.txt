Hello, to further assist you a video example would be helpful, as it makes it easier to deduce the problem you are having. One means of doing this is by using OBS (<https://obsproject.com/>), another option is using Windows Game Bar (accessed via Windows Key + G), and then uploading to a platform such as YouTube or Streamable. Afterwards, you should post the video into <#656914685152722954> to get feedback.
