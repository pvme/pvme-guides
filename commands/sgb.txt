> **__Summaries on various interactions of the Seren Godbow (SGB)__**

**__Arr1 Dmg Interactions with 2-5:__**
⬥ Arr1 calcs most its damage, and then applies precise and then this value's minimum is saved to be used with a different diminishing multiplier for each of arrows 2-5 to determine the max of the range per arrow, and then it applies equilibrium to each arrow as normal

**__How landing of Arrs2-5 is determined:__**
1) Determine NPC's center
    a) For odd-sized this is true center
    b) For even-size this is SW tile of the middle 2x2 area

2) Choose random tile within floor(Size/2) from the center
     a) The player must be able to walk on this tile from the center of the NPC

3) Choose 4 tiles within 2 tiles of this random center tile
    a) If an arrow is chosen to land on a spot already determined by another arrow it rerolls to find another spot, this is done a max of 10x

**__Practical Applications of This Info:__**
⬥ Assuming BiS, avg dmg will be as follows:
```
(On/Off)-style (avg arrows):
3x3: ~14.7k/11.5k (2.44)
5x5: ~21k/16k (3.31)
5x5 blocking: ~30k/~23.7k (5)
```
So, SGB is only worth using on-style for 3x3+, and off-style for 5x5+

**__Crit Interactions of Arr2-5__**
⬥ Crit chance for these is updated when they are "cast," i.e., after Arrow1 hits/3t after SGB cast

**__IoTH Interactions:__**
⬥ Normally when you SGB, if Arr1 hits, then remaining will not splash
    • So, you can IoTH SGB, as it will make Arr1 hit, thus 2-5 will not splash

*__Note: The following are only applicable to SGB EoF:__*
   
**__Chin SGB Interactions:__**
⬥ It acts as if you have SGBed N times, once per target affected by the Chin effect

⬥ It unlinks Arr1 and Arrs2-5 accuracies
    • You can hit Arr1 and splash Arrs2-5, and the inverse is also true now
    
**__Bakriminel Bolt Interactions:__**
⬥ These are determined on cast, and only Arr1 can proc them
    • Also, if it affects Arr1's hit directly (e.g., Ruby/Onyx,) will also affect Arrs2-5 as described earlier
