> **__Various Interactions of the Seren Godbow (SGB)__**

**__Reliance on Arrow 1:__**
⬥ Arrows 2-5+ scale their random damage (and so max hit) based on the minimum hit of Arrow 1 after precise perk is applied. Equilibrium perk is applied as normal

**__Where Arrows 2-5 can land:__**
1) Determine NPC's center
    a) True center for odd sizes
    b) SW of the middle 2x2 area for even sizes

2) Choose random tile within floor(Size/2) from the center
     a) It must be possible for the player to walk from this tile to the NPC's center

3) Choose 4 random tiles in a 2 tile radius from the above tile
    a) If an arrow chooses to land on a tile already chosen by a previous arrow, it will reroll its choice up to 10 times

**__Practical Applications of This Info:__**
⬥ Assuming best in slot gear, average damage will be as follows:
```
On/Off-style (average arrows):
3x3: 14.7k/11.5k (2.44)
5x5: 21k/16k (3.31)
5x5 blocking: 30k/23.7k (5)
```
So, SGB is only worth using on-style for 3x3+, and off-style for 5x5+

**__Multiple SGBs Hitting A Single Target:__**
⬥ Each spec that hits within 2 ticks will get a normal Arrow 1 hit. Arrows 2-5 can hit as normal and any arrows beyond those will continue to scale down linearly until their max hit is the same as their min hit.

**__Crit Interactions of Arrows 2-5:__**
⬥ Crit chance for these is updated when they are "cast," i.e., after Arrow1 hits/3t after SGB cast

**__IoTH Interactions:__**
⬥ Normally when you SGB, if Arrow 1 hits, then remaining will not splash
    • So, you can IoTH SGB, as it will make Arrow 1 hit, thus 2-5 will not splash

**__Note: The following are only applicable to SGB EoF:__**

**__Chin SGB Interactions:__**
⬥ It acts as if you have SGBed N times, once per target affected by the Chin effect

**__Bakriminel Bolt Interactions:__**
⬥ These are determined on cast, and only Arrow 1 can proc them
    • Also, if it affects Arrow 1's hit directly (e.g., Ruby/Onyx) it will also affect Arrows 2-5 as described earlier
