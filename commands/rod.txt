Activates before Sign of Life and has a 3 minute cooldown.\n⬥ A damage-over-time effect is applied to you that deals increasingly more damage over time for 3 minutes.\n⬥ Un-equipping the ring will triple the damage until it is re-equipped.\n⬥ Currently, this effect is removed on many phase transitions of bosses and thus can be used near-losslessly.\n⬥ Can be overcharged to have 5x capacity by Death.\n⬥ Can be upgraded by the Mazcab Armoursmith to increase its damage bonus."
