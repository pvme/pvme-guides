> **__Ring of Death benefits__**
**TL;DR: The reduced death cost only becomes relevant when your risk of death is high, and your regular death cost is significantly more expensive.**

**__How it works__**
Recharged by 50% per Onyx used, the Ring of Death <:RoD:513190159462825984> consumes 15% (<:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Consumables!E9$) of its charge upon death for the following benefits:
⬥ You are sent to your last Respawn Point without having to visit Death's Office.
⬥ Familiar and inventory/scrolls are kept on death.
⬥ You can upgrade the Ring of Death to a 5x capacity for the total cost of <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Miscellaneous!H8$ using:
    • 5 Onyxes
    • 25 Black Stone hearts
    • 150 Reaper points
        - The Ring will now activate for 3% of its charge, death cost remains unchanged.
