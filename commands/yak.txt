> **__Reasons to use a combat familiar over a Beast of Burden__**
**TL;DR: Priorize damaging familiars as more damage dealt means less damage taken, but if you still want to use a BoB, always pick Mammoth with Scrolls**

The current meta strategies of **all** boss encounters is to the end the fight as quickly as it is reasonably possible. To achieve this, we implement damage boosting tools within our inventories, stats, gear, and just as importantly, the familiars we summon.

This way, if mechanics are not outright skipped, they're greatly shortened and thus increase our chance of success.

If you still want to bring a Beast of Burden, it is paramount a Pack Mammoth <:Mammoth:513195712146702337> with Mammoth Feast scrolls is used **instead** of a Pack Yak <:Yak:513195712201228289>. Its scrolls do the following:
