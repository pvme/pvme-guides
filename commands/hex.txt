**__What Provides the Modifer__**
Hexhunter Bow <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, and the Inquisitor's Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>

**__What Exactly is the Modifier__**
When a hex weapon is used against a target that is susceptible to that specific weapon, you gain a +12.5% damage boost and a +10% hitchance boost

**__When is the Modifier Applied__**
It is applied after everything is calculated in terms of damage and hitchance assuming the weapon is T80, likely with exception of DBA <:DBA:603979368850653216> and Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050>

**__What Does This Mean__**
This means the damage and accuracy would scale and so depending on debuffs against the enemy and your gear and boosts among other things the tier equivalent can change
