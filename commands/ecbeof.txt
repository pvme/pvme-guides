**__Disclaimer: If you plan to Nex, dont get an ECB EoF until you finish your grind, or you get a 2nd EOF__**

Ecb Eof is better for several reasons:
⬥ Access to AS4 over AS1
⬥ Access to Flank under Ecb Special
⬥ Ability to Needle insted of Dazing Shot under Ecb Special
⬥ Can do B2B Special Attacks under Ecb special
⬥ Ability to execute better rots (harder to quantify)
    • For instance, makes Tendrils better under ECB as you gain a MH Auto with it
⬥ Can use chins under Ecb Special (notable at places like EDs)

But there are drawbacks:
⬥ You lose 2H Autos + Dazing Shot (though you can substitute this somehow, e.g., with a Wyvern Crossbow)
⬥ You have shorter attack range (since odds are youre camping crossbows)
⬥ You may need to put Caroming, etc, on t80 too, so that will do less damage relative to it having been on say an offhand t90, and that not super reasonable to do without blightbounds
⬥ It is also harder to use because you will be using more switches overall
