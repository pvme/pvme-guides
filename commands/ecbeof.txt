__Ecb Eof is *Better* for several reasons__:
⬥ Access to AS4 over AS1
⬥ Access to Flank under Ecb Special
⬥ Ability to Needle instead of Dazing Shot under Ecb Special
⬥ Can do B2B Special Attacks under Ecb special
⬥ Ability to execute better rots (harder to quantify)
    • For instance, makes Tendrils better under ECB as you gain a MH Auto with it
⬥ Can use chins under Ecb Special (notable at places like EDs)

__But there are some *Drawbacks*__:
⬥ You lose 2H Autos + Dazing Shot (though you can substitute this somehow, e.g., with a Wyvern Crossbow)
⬥ You have shorter attack range (since odds are you're camping crossbows)
⬥ You may need to put Caroming, etc, on t80 too, so that will do less damage relative to it having been on say an offhand t90, and that not super reasonable to do without blightbounds
⬥ It is also harder to use because you will be using more switches overall

**__Disclaimer__: These drawbacks are very relevant to Nex. Do not get an Ecb EoF until you either finish your grind or acquire a second Ecb.**
