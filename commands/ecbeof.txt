__Ecb Eof is *Better* for several reasons__:
⬥ Access to AS4 <:as4:712074245202772009> over AS1. 
⬥ Access to Flank <:flank4:712073088296157185> under Ecb Special.
⬥ Ability to Needle <:needle:535541259108876293> instead of Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> under Ecb Special.
⬥ Can do B2B Special Attacks under Ecb special.
⬥ Ability to execute better rots (harder to quantify)
    • For instance, makes Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> better under ECB as you gain a MH Auto with it.
⬥ Can use chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> under Ecb Special (notable at places like EDs)

__But there are some *Drawbacks*__:
⬥ You lose 2H Autos + Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> (though you can substitute this somehow, e.g., with a Wyvern Crossbow)
⬥ You have shorter attack range (since odds are you're camping Crossbows)
⬥ You may need to put Caroming <:caroming4:791281588792590336>, etc, on t80 too, so that will do less damage relative to it having been on say an offhand t90, and that not super reasonable to do without Blightbound Crossbows.
⬥ It is also harder to use because you will be using more switches overall.

**__Disclaimer__: These drawbacks are very relevant to Nex. Do not get an Ecb EoF until you either finish your grind or acquire a second Ecb.**
