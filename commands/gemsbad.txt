> **__Why Gems Are a Bad Metric__**
**Tl;dr: While better than nothing, overall they will not accurately represent how you will perform at a boss**

**__The List:__**
1. **__Gem Rotations ≠ Boss Rotations__**

2. **__Boss rotations ≠ Non-stop Static 5-minute Fight Rotation:__**
    a) Unlike static Dummies, Bosses have phases and mechanics that exist which affect your rotation overall.
        - To effectively do damage these need to be taken into account to properly manage cooldowns while still maintaining the highest damage output.

3. **__High Gem Number ≠ Fast Boss Time:__**
    a) As mentioned, gem rotations are not boss rotations.
    b) Using a gem rotation may reduce the odds of getting certain boss skips which can shave off a lot of time.
        - A rotation created for such a purpose would manage to pull it off as well as continue from it effectively.

4. **__Arbitrary Gem Restrictions:__**
    a) These will reduce DPM significantly relative to boss encounters, and as such are not an accurate representation of your actual DPM.
