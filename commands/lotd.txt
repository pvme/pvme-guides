> **__Why Luck of the Dwarves is a minimal upgrade__**
**TL;DR: The 1% increase in drop chance and Hazelmere drop chance is incredibly minimal for almost all in-game content, the money is better spent on improving your KPH / kill quality at nearly every boss.**

**__How it works__**
Luck of the Dwarves <:LotD:566453486913323042> **notable** benefits are as follows:
⬥ A 1% increase in drop rate at nearly every boss encounter in-game.
    • Only relevant at Magister' phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> becomeing 1/17, from 1/18.
        - Decreasing the kills needed for a Khopesh <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> to 510, from 540, saving a substantial amount of money.
⬥ Generates a second, smaller chest on your Telos chest that has small increases to the common drops you currently have.
    • Additionally, an (estimated) 1/1,500 chance for a unique to be rerolled from a common drop.
        - The opposite is also true. Thus it's suggested to **not** use the respective Luck Relic for Telos.
⬥ The ring shining for drops **doesn't** mean the increased chance gave you the drop, or that it was even affected by the previous 1% increase, it just means a drop was received.

**__Reasoning__**
At the ring's current price of <moneymoneymoney>, its significantly better to redirect these funds to more direct PvM upgrades **if possible.** An example of this is priorizing purchasing a stronger weapon with these funds, with which you can improve your kills-per-hour and thus your profit-per-hour.
