> **__Why Luck of the Dwarves is a Minimal Upgrade__**
**TL;DR: The 1% increase in drop chance and Hazelmere drop chance is incredibly minimal for almost all PvM content, the money is better spent on improving your KPH / kill quality at nearly every boss.**

**__How it Works__**
Luck of the Dwarves <:LotD:566453486913323042> **notable** benefits are as follows:
⬥ A 1% increase in drop rate at nearly every boss encounter in-game.
    • Only relevant for making Magister's phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> become 1/17, from 1/18.
        - This decreases the kills needed for a Khopesh <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> to 510, from 540, saving <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Miscellaneous!E4$
⬥ Generates a second chest on your Telos chest that has small increases to the common drops you currently have.
    • Additionally, an (estimated) 1/1,500 chance for a unique to be rerolled from a common drop.
⬥ Looting the Arch-Glacor loot chest with the ring equipped has a small chance of increasing the amount of Dark Nilas <:darknilas:884739993527013426> you receive.
⬥ The ring shining for drops doesn't mean the increased chance gave you the drop, or that it was even affected by the previous 1% increase, it just means a drop was received.

**__Reasoning__**
At the ring's current price of <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Miscellaneous!B3$, it is significantly better to redirect these funds to more direct PvM upgrades **if possible.** An example of this is purchasing a stronger weapon with these funds, with which you can improve your kills-per-hour and thus your profit-per-hour.

Additionally, placing the ring's effects on your Archaeology relics will reduce your potential damage output further, as it would take the place of more important combat relics.
