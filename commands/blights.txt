__**Tl;dr: The gains do not outweight the cost nor how much it sets you back from other upgrades**__

Blightbounds are low priority as the cost for the slight tier increase over ascensions does not matter as much due to your primary damage output coming as a result of Bakriminel Bolts.

Further, buying Blightbounds sets you back on more important upgrades such as Eldritch Crossbow, Seren Godbow, and Greater Ricochet.
