__**Tl;dr: The gains do not outweight the cost nor how much it sets you back from other upgrades**__
Blightbounds <:bbc:626714879218155521> <:bbcoh:626714879230738434> are low priority as the cost for the slight tier increase over ascensions does not matter as much due to your primary damage output coming as a result of Bakriminel Bolts.

Further, buying <:bbc:626714879218155521><:bbcoh:626714879230738434> sets you back on more important upgrades such as Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186>, and Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238>.
