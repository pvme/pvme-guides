⬥ Pro: It can save an inventory slot as it takes the position of both the shield and Planted Feet switch
⬥ Con: Defenders are half the tier of an equivalent shield so it will provide lower Resonances <:res:535541258844635148> / Diverts <:divert:787904334377648130>, as well as shortening abilities such as Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> compared to its shield tier equivalent
    • The biggest determiner to bringing a shield generally being <:divert:787904334377648130>

**__Pros and Cons of Excaliburs__** <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727>
⬥ Pro: Because an <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727> is used everywhere, Planted Feet can be placed on it instead of a defender to get around their shortcomings
    • Moreover, in cases where no shield abilities are required at all, or where a shield is mandatory, it saves an additional inventory slot compared to defender switch
⬥ Con: Unless you click on your <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727> from your inventory, your character will attempt to MD your target
    • The way to avoid this is to off somehow before or after equipping your <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727> (e.g., by clicking under yourself)
