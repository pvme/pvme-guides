**__Introduction__**
The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>.

Each solo run of ED3 is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!E568$ in eldritch pieces. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B571$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C571$ gp/hr.

During group encounters each player can roll an Eldritch piece individually.
Solo - (180/10,000)  Duo - (90/10,000)  Trio - (60/10,000)
.
**__General Notes__**
⬥ The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation.
⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.
⬥ Consider downgrading your graphics to Minimum with Medium+ draw distance for the Dungeon, as it is poorly optimized and prone to frame drops.
⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.

**__General Notes__**
⬥ Two presets are sufficient for the Reef, the second one is for The Ambassador, as Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> and Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> are used for the fight.
    • <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** will **not** improve unique drop rates.
⬥ Reckless <:reckless:643505179378974748> is the best aura for the dungeon, followed by Inspiration <:inspiration:643505652634746881> then Mahjraat <:mahj:643148943856762890>.

⬥ <:ed3luckycharm:841409588938276874> **Lucky Charms** are optional, they average up to 1.2m per run.
    • Tokens are better spent on Port Enhancers for Superior Scrimshaws or obtaining Seasinger weapons.
    • These don't enhance Eldritch piece drop rates.
⬥ <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> Kal'Gerion demon is best used in this dungeon.

> __**The Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VENcARf.jpg
.
As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, greatly reduced by having Weapon Poison active.

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poisonous Breath** - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage and contaminating the arena. Never stand in the centre nor infront of the Leviathan.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/RCt6T7m.mp4
.
⬥ **Many Heads** - The Leviathan has additional heads that will stun and poison you in the contaminated zones if you are near them.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/YDfiuOf.mp4
.
⬥ **Head Sweep** - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5sWppnG.mp4
.
⬥ **Tactical Retreat** - After going through one **Dragon Breath** and two sets of **Head Sweeps**, the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation.
    • Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> back to his main head once this happens to prevent getting stunned.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/3iANozs.mp4
.
__**Strategy**__
Defensive + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> → Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> → Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> (roughly at the middle of his head) + <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> + Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135> → Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → improvise

Your primary objective is to fit in 2 Rapid Fire's <:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 Snap Shot's <:snap:535534127131394088>, 4 Greater Ricochet's <:grico:787904334812807238>, 2 Corruption Shot's <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, and a  varying number of Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> depending on your adrenaline.

*Note: Any bleed used will be considered walked as he moves to the opposite side of the arena, use this to your advantage if you're getting 2 cycles.*

**__Room 1__**
⬥ Acceleration Pot <:accel:756236265472524418> and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> your way to the Zealot and Crabs.
    • 1 cycling Crassian will allow you to have an extra Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> in case of messing up.
⬥ Stay at melee distance of the Zealot and kill all the relevant mobs.
.

*Note: Crabs hit for up to 3K each.*

.
**__Room 2__**
⬥ Equip Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> into good abilities.
    • Luring is intuitive as their positions are completely random.

.
**__Room 3__**
⬥ Kill the Necromancer and the Huge Skeleton with a <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> or  Dark Bow  <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, saving 80% adrenaline for the next room if Rapid Fire was used <:rapid:535541270521708566>.
    • Expect frame drops on the way to the cliff.

**__Room 4__**
⬥ Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> or Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>to kill the Necromancer.
⬥ Activate your Undead Sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> and Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, cleaning up as seen fit.

*Note: There will be a massive frame drop afterwards, spam click your compass when entering the second floor, into Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> the center of the room.*

    • Kill the Necromancer to the West and interact with the guarded artefact.

*Note: When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping your Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal.*

.
**__Room 2 (Bridge)__**
⬥ Target the Necromancer with a stalled Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> + Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> release with a 9sq weapon from this square move back → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> then back in to stack the Horrors and the Necromancer for a <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>. Afterwards you have two options:
    • The safe clear is being at a distance from the horrors, cleaning up as seen fit.
    • Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> melee distance → Western Horror with <:grico:787904334812807238> → Eastern Horror with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, cleaning up as seen fit.

⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>  as demonstrated to avoid aggro from the Sotapanna's.
⬥ Apply Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> and wait for detonation before clearing the mobs.
⬥ Once in position, use Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546> on a Necromancer to stack all relevant mobs together.
    • The gate opens when the 2 Necromancers, and 2 Huge Skeletons are killed.

It's easier to triple Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> for this line instead, it'll just be slightly slower as demonstrated below.

> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/sToihl3.jpg
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> , Undead Slayer perk <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> purposes.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** -  This Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Xq8JxyR.mp4
.
    • If left alive, the Rift will detonate for up to 9,000 hard typeless damage.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/lNWdkWt.mp4
.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/pkwjo5O.mp4
.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each.
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs until its death.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/L3klbH8.mp4
.
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's auto-attacks.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/LeJAsiN.mp4
.
        - Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed.
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards.
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket.

.
⬥ **Spirit Wall** - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact.
    • Move out of the way as needed be.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ESTxXSQ.mp4
.
⬥ **Absorb Undeath** - Periodically, Taraket may absorb all skeletons in the arena to heal 2,000 per skeleton.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Kqlh96V.mp4
.
__**Strategy**__
The use of Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> after using your Essence of Finalities <:eofor:745279787471470713> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits Kranon, the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, self-healing, and the usage multiple combat styles.

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Ambassador's Attack Rotation**__
⬥ **1M to 550k**
    • Mage / Melee auto → 5 autos → Black Stone Flames → 5 autos  → Unstable Black Hole → 5 autos  → Black Stone Flames → 5 autos  → TriBeam + Sinister Fragments → Pulse of Erebus + 5 autos → Repeat

⬥ **550k - 400k**
    • Crassian Ritual Keepers are summoned.
    • Tribeam, Sinister Fragments and Pulse of Erebus are no longer part of the attack rotation going forward.

.
⬥ **Seiryu's Intervention - Death**
    • 5 autos → Melee / Magic Bomb → 5 autos → Melee / Magic Bomb → Shadow Onslaught

.
**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Black Stone Flames**
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head.
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase.
    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks.
        - These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5bWwQXr.mp4
.
⬥ **Unstable Black Hole**
    • The Ambassador will spawn an unstable black hole near the area that is despawned by stunning it.
.

    • If not stunned, the Black Hole will detonate for a hard typeless of up to 9,000.
.

.
⬥ **Tribeam & Sinister Fragments**
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute.
    • The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
        - The entry gate is located East of the arena.
    • He'll use the Fragments every full attack rotation **or** by hitting the 650K cap until the next phase commences.

*Tribeam Unleashed*
.

.
    • Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a **Pulse of Erebus** per absorption, dealing 8,000 soft typeless damage.
.

**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ Tribeam, Sinister Fragments and Pulse of Erebusa are no longer used.
⬥ The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> harder to use.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GuVOe7f.mp4

**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Black Stone Flames and Unstable Black Holes are no longer used.
⬥ Seiryu intervens shortly after, healing you to full.

.
⬥ A circle of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena.
    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant dark magic towards the Ambassador.
        - The first outburst of dark magic is unblockable.
.

        - An unblocked projectile will heal the Ambassador for 2500HP.
.

        - Standing between the Ambassador and the projectiles will make them black, damaging you for a small typeless hit but will **not** heal the Ambassador.
.

⬥ **Shadow Onslaught**
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.

__**Strategy**__
⬥ **1M-650k**
*Note: All Unstable Black Holes will be cleared with Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> / Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546>.*

    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and equip Ruby bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>.

.
<:deathsswift:994921434633744455> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> →  improvise → Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> the Unstable Black Hole.

    • Due to the great variance of adrenaline with the usage of critical hits and bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>, this rotation can be tweaked if needed be.
    • Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be used by standing directly underneath him, or by standing South when he summons the Black Hands.

.
⬥ **Tribeam**
    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> and Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> as soon as possible.
    • <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only once at the start.
    • At the 6th Fragment you will build to this rotation: Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> → Basics → Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> → Basics → Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> → Basics Defensives / Bleeds → Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> → More Basics.
        - The cue to start this setup is roughly at 46s from Spinner start. Any further increases the risk of having to rely on Hydrix bolt <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> and Relentless procs for the setup.

.
⬥ **After Tribeam**
    • With Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> active at all times, your priority is to **spam** Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as much as possible, saving Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737> for the Ritual.
        - This rotation is RNG-reliant and demands improvisation if your procs / crits fall short.
    • Use atleast one Seren Godbow spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
    • With a good damage output, your Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> will be on cooldown as ritual starts. Adapt accordingly with a Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> shortly before the Ritual begins.

.
⬥ **Ritual**
*Note: Not necessarily the start of the ritual, but rather when your Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> is finally off-cooldown.*

<:deathsswift:994921434633744455> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> →  improvise

If you're going to get a second Mage Onslaught **don't** use Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> + <:rapid:535541270521708566>, save it for Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737>
