**__Introduction__**
The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>.

Each solo run of ED3 is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!E568$ in eldritch pieces. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B571$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C571$ gp/hr.

.
**__General Notes__**
⬥ The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation.
⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.
⬥ Consider downgrading your graphics to Minimum with Medium+ draw distance for the Dungeon, as it is poorly optimized and prone to frame drops.
⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.

**__Preset Notes__**
⬥ Two presets are sufficient for the Reef, the second one is for The Ambassador, as Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> and Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> are used for the fight.

As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, greatly reduced by having Weapon Poison active.

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poison Pits + Additional Heads** - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the Leviathan. Never stand here.

.
⬥ **Dragon Breath** - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage. Stand off to the side to avoid this.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/RCt6T7m.mp4
.
⬥ **Head Sweep** - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5sWppnG.mp4
.
⬥ After going through one **Dragon Breath** and two sets of **Head Sweeps**, the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation.
    • Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> back to his main head once this happens.

Your primary objective is to fit in 2 Rapid Fire's <:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 Snap Shot's <:snap:535534127131394088>, 4 Greater Ricochet's <:grico:787904334812807238>, 2 Corruption Shot's <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, and a  varying number of Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> depending on your adrenaline.

*Note: Any bleed used will be considered walked as he moves to the opposite side of the arena, use this to your advantage if you're getting 2 cycles.*

    • The gate opens when the 2 Necromancers, and 2 Huge Skeletons are killed.

> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> , Undead Slayer perk <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> purposes.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** -  This Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode for heavy typeless damage to the player. Prevented by killing it.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Xq8JxyR.mp4
.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each.
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs until its death.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/L3klbH8.mp4
.
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's auto-attacks.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/LeJAsiN.mp4
.
        - Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed.
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards.
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket.

.
⬥ **Spirit Line** - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact.
    • Move out of the way as needed be.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ESTxXSQ.mp4
.
__**Strategy**__
The use of Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> after using your Essence of Finalities <:eofor:745279787471470713> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

⬥ Gauge when will it be appropiate to Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as their positions are largely random.

    • Equip a stronger weapon if they're too far apart from each other.
    • If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> in your Essence of Finality <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, you may attempt to Split Soul here with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

⬥ Inmediately Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> the middle Zealot and clean up afterwards.
    • If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> in your Essence of Finality <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, you may Split Soul here with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>
        - Alternatively, attempt to Chincend <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:incend:535541258429661215> all mobs for an instant clear!
    • Zealots may aggro independently of one another, ruining the lure. You can fix it by dragging **all** Zealots and walking back to the gate you came from.
        - Skeletons ought to be killed first, and at the same time as you are luring the Zealots.
⬥ Try to stack all mobs if possible., using Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> to priorize the Skeleton's death.

    • Don't worry if the mini-bosses attack you, simply bind them / teleport out quickly after the gate is open to bank comfortably.
    • A faster but slightly riskier way to get there is through this Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> as shown below:

⬥ Attempt to stack all four mobs together, clear as seen fit while keeping 100% adrenaline for the entry to Kranon, the Ambassador.

*Note: Remember to rebind your Brews <:Brew:565726489400573962> from your Guthix Rests <:grest:689530593901412578> from your action bar if applicable.*

At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits Kranon, the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, self-healing, and the usage multiple combat styles.

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Ambassador's Attack Rotation**__
⬥ **1M HP to 550K - Phase 1**
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat
.

.
*Magic Auto-Attack*
.
⬥ **550K to 400K - Phase 2**
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.

.
⬥ **Ritual - Kill**
    • 5 autos → Melee/Magic → 5 autos → Melee/Magic → Onslaught

.
**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple Corruption**
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head.
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase.
    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks.
        - These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5bWwQXr.mp4
.
⬥ **Black Hole**
    • The Ambassador will spawn a black hole near the area that will explode a few seconds afterwards, dealing 8000+ damage to the player
    • Despawned by stunning it.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/KkpYl0Z.mp4
.
⬥ **Sinister Fragments**
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute.
    • The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
        - The entry gate is located East of the arena.
    • He'll use the Fragments every full attack rotation **or** by hitting the 650K cap until the next phase commences.

*Beams unleashed*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Vg7ztvk.mp4
.
    • Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a hard hitting typeless explotion per fragment absorbed.

.
.img:https://imgur.com/3U8LBRS.mp4
.
**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ The Ambassador stops spawning Sinister Fragments.
⬥ The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> harder to use.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GuVOe7f.mp4
.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ The Ambassador will stop doing his Corruption and Black Hole mechanics, continuing his auto attack pattern as normal.
⬥ Seiryu will emerge shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.
⬥ A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena.
    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the Ambassador.
        - The first outburst of smokes are unblockable.
        - A white smoke will heal the Ambassador for 2500HP.
        - Standing between the Ambassador and the smokes will make them black, damaging you for a small typeless hit but will **not** heal the Ambassador.

*Seiryu arrives*

__**Strategy**__
⬥ **1M HP**
*Note: All Black Holes will be cleared with Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> / Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546>.*

    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and equip Hydrix bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>.

.
<:ds:535541258924326912> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> →  <:mds:535541259033378827> → <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>  → <:grico:787904334812807238> + <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> just right before the next auto hits you and camp <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> + <:rapid:535541270521708566> <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>  → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:grico:787904334812807238> → Improvise depending on food, adrenaline and damage.

    • Due to the great variance of adrenaline with the usage of Hydrix bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>, this rotation can be tweaked if needed be.
    • Juicing Spirituals <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> with Ripper <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> greatly increases your speed. Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be used by standing directly underneath him, or by standing South when he summons the Black Hands.

.
⬥ **Spinners**
    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> and Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> as soon as possible.
    • Use anything to kill the first five spinners.
    • At the 6th spinner you will build to this rotation: Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> → Basic Defensives → Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> → Basic Defensives → Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> → Basic Defensives / Bleeds → Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>.
        - The cue to start this setup is roughly at 46s from Spinner start. Any further increases the risk of having to rely on Hydrix bolt <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> and Relentless procs for the setup.
    • Use your Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> around 3.6s before he's attackable again.
    • Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> **if** you need the adrenaline, onto the Ambassador just as soon as he's attackable.

.
⬥ **After Spinners**
    • With Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> active, your priority is to **spam** Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as much as possible, saving Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737> for the Ritual.
        - This rotation is RNG-reliant and demands improvisation if your procs / crits fall short.
    • Use atleast one Seren Godbow spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
    • If food allows you to, attempt to Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> up to three more times in here.
    • With a good damage output, your Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> will be on cooldown as ritual starts. Adapt accordingly with a Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> shortly before the Ritual begins.
        - Ambassador faces Seiryu once he starts the Ritual, allowing you to <:flank4:712073088296157185> Flank twice with ease.

.
⬥ **Ritual**
*Note: Not necessarily the start of the ritual, but rather when your DS is finally off-cooldown. Death's Swiftness can be skipped altogether if your hits were extremely good beforehand*

<:ds:535541258924326912> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> →  <:mds:535541259033378827> → <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>  → <:grico:787904334812807238> + <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> just right before the next auto hits you and camp <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> + <:rapid:535541270521708566> <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>  → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:grico:787904334812807238> → Improvise depending on food, adrenaline and damage.

If you're going to get a second Mage Onslaught **don't** use Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> + <:rapid:535541270521708566>, save it for Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737>
