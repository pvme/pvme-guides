> **__Introduction__**
The second Elite Dungeon released, the Dragonkin Laboratory is a relatively straightforward encounter. Categorized as mid tier PvM, the encounter is useful for anyone wanting to learn how to deal with large mobs as well as bosses, combining aspects of single target and AoE damage.

The three bosses of the Laboratory drop the Greater Flurry, Greater Fury and Greater Barge codices in the order that they appear, improving your Melee techniques vital to end-game PvM

**__General Notes__**
⬥ The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation.
⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.
⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.
⬥ The Corbicula Rex <:corbicula:690136117273821280> perk (112 Farming) in ROoT is extremely helpful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is frequently used here.

.
In terms of raw damage intake, Section 1 has some of the most strenuous and intense rooms in the dungeon. Laboratory Slimes, Spiders, and Magma Golems can stack up their damage extremely quickly, and the Celestial dragons can output a lot of damage in their own right. If committed to using Erethdor's grimoire <:grim2:643168158613504031> in the dungeon, it may still be worth camping Scrimshaw of vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> in the more populated rooms, if only to prevent having to eat through all of your supplies before Astellarn.

.
__**Room 1**__
(Defeat 4 Laboratory Slimes)
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> forward into the chest then cut the corner by Bladed Diving <:bd:535532854281764884> down the steps.
⬥ Only 3 slimes spawn on either side of the room, so at least one must be lured to the other side to aoe enough to clear the barrier.
    • Damage from laboratory slimes will rapidly stack up if the room is not dealt with quickly.

<:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> (If necessary) + <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:quake:535532879506309150>

.
__**Room 2**__
(Defeat 3 Red Dragons)
⬥ A safe, consistent way to handle this room is to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> down the steps, Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> toward the red dragon on the second set of stairs, and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> down to the wall down the stairs. This will consistently lure the other two red dragons together at the top of the stairs to easily aoe them.
⬥ Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as soon as possible against the first red dragon, continue your berserk using aoes against the next two, and finish your berserk on the red dragons past this barrier.

<:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → (on-task) <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> → (build) → <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → (aoe)

.
__**Room 3**__
(Defeat 4 Red Dragons)
⬥ Finish your <:Berserk:513190158468907012> Berserk while aoeing the closest pack of 3 red dragons. Build adrenaline to prepare to use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> against the magma golems on the bridge after you defeat the fourth red dragon.

(finish) <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → (aoe) → (build)

.
__**Room 4**__
(Defeat 4 Magma Golems)
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> down the bridge and use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> against 4+ Magma golems as soon as possible. Finish them off with aoes until the barrier is cleared.

<:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> (If necessary) + <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:quake:535532879506309150>

.
__**Room 5**__
(Defeat 1 Celestial and 2 Slimes/Books)
⬥ From the bridge, Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> behind the celestial dragon. Apply your bleeds, preferably walking Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, and then use a sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> to pre-bind it. If executed correctly, you may finish off the celestial and two slimes with aoes as the sticky bomb will cancel the celestial dragon's healing special attack.
⬥ Damage will add up very quickly in this room. Watch your life points and finish it quickly.

(walked) <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → (bleeds) + <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> → (aoe)

.
__**Room 6**__
(Defeat 3 Celestial Dragons)
⬥ After clearing the barrier, use a defensive ability and <:surge:535533810004262912> Surge through the door. This will allow the use of Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> without draining adrenaline.
⬥ Build with basics to use Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as soon as possible. Use aoes to clear the 3 celestial dragons.

<:devo:513190158728953857> → <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → (aoe) + (spam) <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>

.
__**Room 7**__
(Defeat 1 Celestial Dragon)
⬥ Ideally, use a Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>, finish your Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> on the next dragon, and finish it with bleeds and thresholds.

(finish) <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> → (thresholds)

.
__**Room 8**__
(Defeat 1 Celestial Dragon)
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> down the steps to lure the non-critical path celestial dragon and block the slimes from following you down.
⬥ Use a Sticky bomb <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> and kill the celestial dragon closest to the boss barrier. End with greater than ~60% adrenaline minimum.

(on-task) <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> + <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> → (bleeds) → (build to 60%+ adrenaline)

.tag:astellarn

.
**__Overview__**
⬥ **Life Points**: 250,000
⬥ **Special Drops**
    • Greater Flurry Codex <:gflurry:535532879283879977> <:greatercodex:643169137098752001>
⬥ **Attack Rotation**
Pulsar → Wyrmhole → Neutron Star → White Hole

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Damage Reduction** - Upon reaching 200k life points, Astellarn will gain strong damage reduction. This is applied following her first auto attack after she is damaged under 200k life points.

⬥ **Pulsar** - Astellarn spawns small orange orb with 20k life points that periodically deals moderate "cannon-type" damage and is successible to  Dominion mines<:dommine:662249620579155968>. It is highly recommended to kill this soon after it spawns.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/0UabHmn.mp4
.
⬥ **Celestial Rain** - Upon reaching 200k life points, Astellarn will targets a quadrant of the boss room with a low-damaging typeless-damage <:Constitution:689509250887712902> aoe effect that ramps up if stood in for too long.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/M6UbQli.mp4
.
⬥ **Wyrmhole** - Astellarn will mark a player with a blue bar. When the bar empties it will drop a black circle on the floor that deals moderate typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage when stood in.

⬥ **Neutron Star** - A small black orb with an orange trail that will explode, dealing severe typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage to the player that came in contact with it. Must be lured into the wyrmhole to progress the boss fight.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/zHIuF3t.mp4
.
⬥ **White Hole** - Once the Neutron star is lured into the Wyrmhole, the aoe will turn white. When a player stands on top of it, Astellarn's damage reduction will be removed, and the player's damage output will be boosted even further.

*Note: Due to the way the attack timing is determined, it is possible for the wyrmhole and neutron star to desynchonize. Be aware that it is possible, but very rare, for the neutron star to spawn before the wyrmhole is placed.*

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ Astellarn can be a very punishing and complex boss  for beginners, especially when using melee, but once the mechanics are understood and handled properly she becomes a very consistent encounter.

⬥ Unlike most bosses, Astellarn's boss fight timer does not start until she is attacked. Keeping this in mind, it is still important to start the boss fight as soon as possible, both for overall dungeon clear time, and because it is possible for slimes from previous rooms to follow you into the boss room if they are not blocked by a celestial dragon, stopped by <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> sticky bombs before the boss room, or stopped by the barrier that closes once the boss fight begins.

⬥ The beginning of the fight is straightforward. Referring to the image, it is highly recommended to only stand in the area highlighted by green. Due to a quirk in Astellarn's auto attack AI, she will only attack with magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> autos while you are standing in the green area, while standing anywhere else will allow her to use all of magic <:Magic:689504724159823906>, ranged <:range:580168050121113623>, and  melee <:melee:615612332521029632> autos. Standing in this area significantly reduces her damage output on you, and makes soul split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking her attacks much easier.

.
⬥ The goal of the first part of the boss fight is to damage Astellarn to under 200k life points (upon which she will gain massive damage reduction) before she spawns her first pulsar. Regardless of her life points, when the pulsar spawns, use dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> on it, drop your <:dommine:662249620579155968> dominion mines, and finish it off with basics. Generally by the time this is accomplished, Astellarn will have already marked you with a secondary bar under your adrenaline that counts down until an aoe damaging "Wyrmhole" is placed underneath you.

⬥ Ideally, this wyrmhole is placed in melee distance, on one of the axes denoted in the image by red, perpendicular lines. The best placement location for this special attack on the axis marked by a red "X" on the image. This placement ensures that the next mechanic, the Neutron star, will not spawn on top of you, ruining the kill.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/m95KVwZ.png
.
⬥ Once the wyrmhole is placed, build adrenaline for berserk and lure the slow moving Neutron star toward the wyrmhole. Once the Neutron star moves into the Wyrmhole, the aoe on the ground will turn white and boost the damage you deal while you stand on top of it. Following this, use Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + Adrenaline renewal <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, and finish your Berserk rotation.

Section 2 is significantly more relaxed compared to the previous section; however, it can also be more difficult to stack up and aoe the Black dragons compared to the much smaller and closely packed Slimes, Golems, and Celestials of the previous areas.

Focus heavily on damage output, smart usage of long cooldowns, and efficient movement and lures. Verak Lith is also a comparatively much more simple boss than Astellarn.

**__Overview__**
⬥ **Life Points**: 600,000
⬥ **Special Drops**
    • Greater Fury Codex <:gfury:535532879334080527> <:greatercodex:643169137098752001>
⬥ **Attack Rotation**
4 Autos → Spire → 4 Autos → Egg Bomb → 4 Autos → Spire → 4 Autos → Divebomb → 4 Autos → Spire → Egg Bomb → 4 Autos → tornados → repeat

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Spire** - Verak Lith becomes immune to most damage and spawns a spire with 15k life points for each player in the room that deals 100% accurate, moderate melee <:melee:615612332521029632> damage as it spawns. Familiars can still damage Verak Lith while the spire is alive.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/afn857t.mp4
.
⬥ **Egg Bomb**
    • Verak Lith hits everyone in the room with a moderate damage magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attack that bounces from the player and places a marker on the ground. The intended way to deal with this mechanic is to catch the bomb as it lands on the marker, take note of the element of the bomb (Shock, Ice, or Poison), and match it with one of the opposing clusters of eggs in the boss room.
        - If the bomb is not caught by the player, it will deal 4000 soft-typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> aoe damage.
        - If not matched to an opposing egg, the energy will discharge, dealing 9000 soft-typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage.
    • As the first part of this special attack is soft-typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> , the optimal way to deal with this mechanic is to simply tank it using Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, or a Powerburst of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737>.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/1c5I5Ar.mp4
.
⬥ **Divebomb** - Verak Lith calls down a dragon that will deal severe magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage in a line, similar to Vindicta's fire attack, after a short delay. It is best dealt with by simply moving out of the way.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/66ACLwS.mp4
.
⬥ **Tornados** - Verak Lith places a cluster of flaming tornados on the players location. After activating, they deal rapid, severe magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage if not avoided. Run far away to ensure you are not stacked out. Seeing this special attack can be indicative of a slow kill.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/J91SxtZ.mp4
.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ Though straightforward, the Verak Lith fight can be punishing to players with low damage output. Spires must be dispatched quickly to ensure enough time to damage the boss before the next Spire spawns, and each additional Spire will slow the encounter down significantly. Therefore, the aim, like many bosses, is to output as much damage as possible, using as many boosts as are available to the player, while dealing with mechanics as they come. If followed well, this rotation will result in consistent 1:20 to 1:30 kills or better. At this speed, Verak Lith's tornado attack will be completely skipped.

⬥ Verak Lith deals moderate to high damage, using only melee attacks in melee <:melee:615612332521029632> distance, and only magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attacks outside of melee distance.

Section 3 is much like Section 2 in that the enemies will have a difficult time stacking out your life points (though they can still do a lot of damage if you aren't careful), but it can also be easier to get better lures on the Gemstones compared to the previous Black Dragons. Be very aware of Hydrix dragon special attacks as getting hit by one may force you out of the dungeon due to its high damage and adrenaline drain.

3 Autos → Gemstone Spikes → 2 Autos → Dragonbreath → Repeat
    • **Phase 2**: Black Hands
    • **Phase 3 (520k - 260k, flying, 260k-0)**
1-5 Autos → Smoke Spiral → 3 Autos → Mage aoe → 2 Autos → Dragon Breath → Gemstone Spikes → 3 Autos → Mage aoe → Smoke Spiral → Repeat after Smoke Spiral

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Gemstone Spikes** - This attack is extremely similar to the Hydrix Gemstone dragon special attack encountered earlier in the dungeon. Upon impact it deals high melee <:melee:615612332521029632> damage, drains adrenaline to 0%, and temporarily halves adrenaline gain.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4ppYV4M.mp4
.
⬥ **Dragonbreath** - A moderate damage magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attack with extremely high accuracy.
*Note: this does not do "dragonfire"-type damage.*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/V3Z0d1j.mp4
.
⬥ **Smoke Spiral** - The Black Stone Dragon will root itself in place while a smoke cloud that deals severe typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage spirals around it. No matter where it starts, the spiral will never hit a player standing directly behind Black Stone Dragon's tail. It is possible to flank the boss by standing in position while this special attack is occurring.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ak3Y05T.mp4
.
⬥ **Mage AoE** - Similar to Verak Lith's tornados, Black Stone Dragon sends several smoke clouds out to somewhere in the boss room. Standing in this area will result in rapid, severe magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/UIpNtaq.mp4.
.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ The Black Stone Dragon is the final encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory. Though her attack speed is relatively slow, she can utilize high-damage magic <:Magic:689504724159823906>, ranged <:range:580168050121113623>, and melee <:melee:615612332521029632> auto attacks, and has very strong area denial mechanics.

⬥ After being damaged to 520k life points, during the time of her next attack she will become immune to damage and four level 122 Black Hands with 80k life points will spawn at the shackles surrounding her. These Black Hands will periodically slap at the ground and fire off high damage magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attack. After this attack lands, a line of shadow hands will spawn out of the hand in a line toward where the tile the attack landed in. These shadow hands deal very rapid, severe typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage. Optimally, the best way to deal with this attack is to allow the magic attack to hit you, move to another side of the hand one tick later, and continue attacking. These enemies are susceptable to the Terrasaur maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> and Dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968>.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Ct6K3vg.png
.
⬥ In addition to this magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> attack, black hands also have a low damage melee <:melee:615612332521029632> attack that may, under currently unknown circumstances, target familiars for inconsequential damage.

⬥ After the four Black Hands have been destroyed, retarget the Black Stone Dragon and continue the rotation until 260k life points, being aware that a smoke spiral special attack will quickly follow the Black Hands phase. Following this, she will jump into the air, land in another place in the boss room and fire out a slow moving, rapid typeless <:Constitution:689509250887712902> damage line of smoke. After landing 7 times, the fight will continue until the boss is dead.
