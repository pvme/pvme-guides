**__Room 1__**
⬥ Lure Slimes to AoE them, kill 4 to proceed.

.
**__Room 2__**
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the staircase to avoid aggroing Spiders and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> on the edge of the wall,
    • Kill 3 Red Dragons to proceed.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/yEnnDjN.png
.
**__Room 2.5__**
⬥ Walk around the wall back into the Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> you placed earlier and finish your rotation.
    • If you have Slimes following you, you need to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> past the Red Dragons and they will get blocked behind them.
    • Slimes get blocked very easily which can be utilized multiple times throughout the section.

.
**__Room 3__**
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the back of the bridge and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>.
    • You only need to kill 4 Golems to proceed but you can catch them all in AoE's very easily.

.
**__Room 4__**
⬥ The optimal way to do this room depends on the positioning of the Slimes and books right as the barrier goes down.
    • If you are immediately aggroed by multiple Slimes and Books: Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> and clear them from the bridge.
    • If you draw only Slime aggro, look to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> behind the Celestial (Slimes will get blocked).
⬥ You must kill the Celestial + several Slimes to pass this room so if you draw no aggro at all you must manually tag some slimes to bring behind the Celestial.

.
**__Room 5__**
⬥ Most of the time you will have extra enemies following you from the previous room so Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> past the 3 Celestials and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the back of the room (extra books, slimes, golems will be blocked).
⬥ Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> there and clear the Celestials.
    • You can use Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> for the dragon.

.
**__Room 6__**
⬥ Deal damage as normal, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> if you'd like.

.
*Note: Room 6 actually occurs after Astellarn.*

The first encounter of the Laboratory, This fight heavily utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics but is still very straightforward and easy to master with some practice. Additionally, he drops the Greater Flurry Codex <:gflurry:535532879283879977>.

**__Mechanics__**
⬥  **Pulsar:** Spawned after 2-3 autoattacks, it has 20,000 hp, dealing moderate periodic damage. Shortly after, a bar will appear above the player's head and a Wyrmhole will spawn at their current location when it fills. This special attack is cast based upon the time you entered the dungeon, potentially de-syncing with the Neutron Star.

*Placing the wyrmhole along these lines will prevent it from being blocked out by the later rain mechanic.*
.

.

.
⬥ **Neutron Star:** This will follow the player around and must be lured into the Wyrmhole, stabilizing it, turning white, and giving increased damage to Astellarn. This special attack is cast based upon the time you started the fight with Astellarn, potentially de-syncing with the Wyrmhole.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/zHIuF3t.mp4
.
If it touches a player, it will explode, dealing 5000 damage. Its highly recommended to teleport out and restart the fight if this happens.

.
⬥ **Celestial Rain:** Once the boss reaches 200,000 HP, Asterllarn will spawn a continuous rain in a random quadrant that deals increasing damage as long as it is stood in. This will change quadrants occasionally and will only be a major issue if the Wyrmhole was placed improperly.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/M6UbQli.mp4
.
From here on, these mechanics repeat with the rain lasting for the remainder of the encounter.

.

.
**__Room 1__**
⬥ Spider aggro can be a nuisance here, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> immediately East here and depending on how many Spiders come along you may need to clear them first.
⬥ Clear the two Lava Strykes at the end to proceed.
.
If lots of aggro is drawn, stand here to stack.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/H1H3g5Y.png
.
**__Room 2__**
⬥ Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the middle of the Black Dragons and clear them.

.
**__Room 3__**
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the end of the path while killing the Dragons and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> when it comes up.
⬥ You need to kill every Black Dragon here to proceed.

.
**__Room 4__**
⬥ You must kill 4/6 Lava Strykes to proceed, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the end of the path right next to the barrier to clear the last two.

.
**__Room 5__**
⬥ Your Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> from the previous room will still be ongoing to clear the 3 Black Dragons at the start.
    • build to 100 at the last Dragon at the end of the path in preparation for Verak Lith.

The second encounter of the Laboratory, his attack rotation is very predictable but deals consistent moderately high damage so it is recommended to learn the few mechanics properly to avoid any unnecessary deaths. Additionally he drops the Greater Fury Codex <:gfury:535532879334080527>.

It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here.

.
**__Verak Lith's Attack Rotation__**
4 Auto attacks → Spire → 4 Auto attacks → Ricochet → 4 Auto attacks → Spire → 4 Auto Attacks → Nosedive/Hurricanes → Repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Spire**: The message "Verak Lith slams his tail against the ground, the earth shakes beneath your feet!" will appear and after a short delay and spire with 15,000 hp will spawn near the player.

The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that can be Resonanced <:res:535541258844635148>. In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking to restore HP.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/afn857t.mp4
.
⬥ **Ricochet**: Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena.

The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a **different** type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up.
    • Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic.

Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729>, or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> (or nothing if the player is high HP). This will end the mechanic early.

*A player picks up the projectile*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/1c5I5Ar.mp4
.
⬥ **Nosedive**: A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing.

This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/66ACLwS.mp4
.
⬥ **Hurricanes**: Verak Lith will say "Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds.

This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane.

⬥ Really straightforward just spam Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at those spots.
    • You can skip the two Onyx Dragons at the start and the other two Hydrix Dragons in the middle.

The Black Stone Dragon is the final boss encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory and is the main source of the dungeon's primary unique: Draconic Energies <:draconicenergy:643162228991983659>, which are used to make the Mage T92 Elite Tectonic set <:elitetectbody:552955120707698699>. Alongside dropping the Greater Barge Codex <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters.

This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight.

.
**__Attack Rotation__**
⬥ **Phase 1**
    • 3 Auto Attacks → Gemstone Spikes → 2 Auto Attacks → Dragonbreath → Repeat
⬥ **Phase 2**
    • Black Hands
⬥ **Phase 3**
    • 1-5 Auto Attacks → Smoke Spiral → 3 Auto Attacks → Mage AoE → 2 Auto Attacks → Dragonbreath → Gemstone Spikes → 3 Auto Attacks → Mage AoE → Repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Gemstone Spikes**: This mechanic occurs a few auto attacks into the start of the fight and after each dragonbreath after phase 1. This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player.

This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4ppYV4M.mp4
.
⬥ **Dragonbreath**: The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3).
.
.img:https://imgur.com/V3Z0d1j.mp4
.
⬥ **Black Hands** (Phase 2): After reaching 515k-500k hp, phase 2 will begin. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/jBFHmJu.mp4
.
These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5MAYT2U.mp4
.
These hands will **never** reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured below.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Oa1qT6q.png
.
The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1.

⬥ **Smoke Spiral**: A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> is possible here.

It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185>
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ak3Y05T.mp4
.
⬥ **Mage AoE**: Black Stone Dragon will call out "GET. OUT. OF. ME." or "The shadow overwhelms!" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/UIpNtaq.mp4.
.
This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked <:flank4:712073088296157185> when it turns to send out the special.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/fJzybng.mp4
.
⬥ **Fly**: Upon hitting 260,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs.

This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from Smoke Spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.
