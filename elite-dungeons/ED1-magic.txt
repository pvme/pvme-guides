.
Each solo run of ED1 is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!E528$ in Ancient Scales. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B532$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C532$ gp/hr

.
**__General Notes__**
⬥ This guide is structured in the order that rooms would be encountered if running the dungeon. Rotations are written to utilize the Greater Chain ability <:gchain:787904334495088672> and assume 4TAA is used; however, neither is required to effectively do this dungeon.

⬥ It's also assumed that you have completed City of Senntisten quest and that you will be using Incite Fear as your auto cast spell.

⬥ Feel free to adjust the boss rotations to better suit your skill level with switches and 4TAA.

⬥ The boss rotations assume you have **Invigorating 4** <:invig4:712073087859949570> perk

⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.

⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.

**__Preset Notes__**
⬥ You can have a specific preset for Seiryu with Deathtouch bracelet <:DTB:513190159429271562>, Zamorak brews <:zamorakbrew:841409588632092694> and Dreadnips <:nip:537336877900890135>.
    • These are however fairly insignificant boosts.
    • It's also possible to include dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> only in this preset and take them away from the main preset.

⬥ It's possible to bring Lucky Charms <:ed1luckycharm:841409588561707009> for some extra profit at the cost of Dungeoneering tokens.

⬥ Mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> perk is a must have on gear.
    • Alternatively, use Shadow's Grace relic <:shadowsgrace:895999229737185280>

⬥ <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** will **not** improve the number of scales dropped.

.
> __**Greater Chain**__
.tag:gchain
**__The Basics__**
⬥ There are many small details which you must take into consideration to get maximum use out of this ability.

⬥ The secondary targets that were hit by Greater chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> will take 50% of the damage by the next ability used on the original target.
    • <:comb:535533833098100745> and <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> will deal 100% of the damage
    • Area-of-effect abilities like <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:deto:535533833358016512> can hit twice on the secondary target for a total of 150% damage

.
**__Using Greater Chain to its Full Potential__**
⬥ Greater chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> will lose its effect if the target it is cast on dies before the effect is used.
    • Since most of the mobs in the dungeon have <20k HP you should only use <:gchain:787904334495088672> on full hp targets
    • Additional damage sources like aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> can kill the target before you get to use the effect.
    • Many of the trash mob packs are started with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>. This initial damage is already significant on low HP targets, so you should always use <:gchain:787904334495088672> another target.

⬥ Strong combos are <:gchain:787904334495088672> + <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, <:gchain:787904334495088672>+ <:wm:535533809978966037> and <:gchain:787904334495088672>+ <:comb:535533833098100745>.

⬥ Always use <:gchain:787904334495088672> with **Caroming 4** <:caroming4:791281588792590336>

*Note: Start with 100% adrenaline from the PvM hub.*

.
**__Room 1__**
⬥ At the start use <:surge:535533810004262912> and head down the stairs. Upon getting to the last pair of stairs use <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> to cut the corner.
    • This is easily done by using <:bd:535532854281764884> through the minimap.
⬥ After landing to the correct spot use target cycle + <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and take 1 step south to line up the Elite Sotapannas. Target the one mob who is not part of the pack and use <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:wm:535533809978966037> on it. Finish the pack with <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> if needed.
.

**__Room 2__**
⬥ <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the next set of trash mobs where you need to kill 9 Elite Sotapannas.
⬥ Use <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:comb:535533833098100745> as shown in the image below. Run to 1 tile north of the mob closest to the door and use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:tsunami:535533809995874304>. Finish any possible stragglers with <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • It's important that the mobs form a square for the sake of <:deto:535533833358016512> and <:tsunami:535533809995874304> hitting all of the mobs.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RV8dqVX.png
.
**__Room 3__**
⬥ Target the middle Elite Sakadagami and <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:wm:535533809978966037>. Run south of the pack for <:dbreath:535533833391702017> AoE as shown in the image below. Finish them with ice wrack and <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
⬥ <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the door and enter it once the three mobs are killed.
⬥ Elite Sakadagami can stun you if they're not killed fast enough, which can interrupt your 4TAA rotation. It's possible to use <:anti:535541306475151390> before starting this room to prevent the stun.

**__Room 4__**
⬥ Use <:anti:535541306475151390> immediately and <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the trash pack. <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on the Elite Sotapanna in the middle.
    • This Elite Sotapanna can heal other mobs so it should be killed first.
⬥ Use <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> as shown in the image below. Use <:wm:535533809978966037> on the mob that wasn't hit by <:deto:535533833358016512>. Use your strongest abilities to finish the pack.
    • Save <:gchain:787904334495088672> for the start of the next room.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/YOT7yug.png
.
**__Room 5__**
⬥ Killing 3 mobs in this room is enough to open the barricade, so choose a side and be careful not to aggro the other pack.
    • Don't enter the room from the middle since it will aggro the whole room.
⬥ <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> the middle one in the pack and <:dbreath:535533833391702017> for AoE as shown in the image below. Finish stragglers with your strongest abilities
    • Save <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> for the next room
⬥ Once again these Elite Sakadagami can stun you so be vary of that when attempting to 4TAA.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/j5FcRjw.png
.
**__Room 6__**
⬥ Drink Powerburst of Acceleration <:accel:756236265472524418> and <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> in a controlled manner diagonally towards the final barricade before the boss. Refer to the map image for the route.
    • It's a good idea to use anticipate before attacking the 3 Elite Sakadagami.
⬥ Use <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> to clear the pack. It is important to finish the pack with 91+ adrenaline for the upcoming boss fight.
⬥ Once the barrier opens to the boss room, <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the back of it and run to the specific lure spot. Refer to the image below for the proper spot.
    • This makes it, so the Arhats will not attack you during the boss fight.
⬥ If you are having trouble with luring the Arhats, it is possible to teleport out of the dungeon and re-enter it to de-aggro the Arhats. This method however loses about 20 seconds.

The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared.

Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. There are two options for approaching this boss fight. A learner friendly strategy has you teleport out of the dungeon before entering the fight and attacking the boss from north side of the arena. A more advanced strategy involves luring Arhats behind the boss making them not attack you.

.
**__Drops__**
⬥ <:fishytreat:643167044887642122> **Fishy Treat**
    • Rare drop
⬥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx Dust**
    • Common drop, 1-34 dropped per kill

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Attack Rotations**
    • 4x Ranged autoattack to start the fight
    • Water Burst → Ranged auto → Water Jet → Ranged auto → Purple Smoke → Autoattack → repeat
    • After the 4th water jet attack, 2 Crassian Reinforcements are summoned. They deal negligible ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway.

*Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> during the attacks travel time if necessary.*

⬥ **Ranged Autoattacks** - A projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hits everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot.
    • As it is targetted to a tile rather than the player and has a travel time before it hits, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands though this is normally not necessary.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/r63xxBI.mp4
.
⬥ **Water Burst** - A high-hitting melee attack.
    • Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic.
    • It is also possible to avoid this attack completely by standing at the back of the arena so it won't reach you or using Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> if you need the extra healing.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/TJngvfo.mp4
.
⬥ **Water Jet** - A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise.
    • Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage.
    • This attack can be dealt with in several ways by blocking with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or simply face-tanking the damage.
    • Standing at the north of the arena allows you to dodge the attack entirely by standing east when it starts and moving west.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/xbJwXJj.mp4
.
*Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> if you're standing south and pray Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> here.*

⬥ **Purple Smoke** - The most dangerous attack of the boss
    • A blue bar will appear above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/2E9Bkhw.mp4
.
    • After a moment, this Smoke cloud <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GXc5zZs.mp4
.
    • The Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight.
        - The placement of the Smokes will depend on which side of the arena you are standing on.
        - If using the south spot, you can place the first smoke on the south wall and the second one directly north of it
        - If you are doing the learner friendly north spot you can place the first smoke directly north of the boss and then stack them to north-east of the arena

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ The following rotation assumes that you are using the south spot for flanking and vulnerability bombs.

> **__Masuta, the Ascended__**
.tag:masuta
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VydlHU7.jpg
.
Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss.

**__Drops__**
⬥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx Dust**
    • Common drop, 1-29 dropped per kill
⬥ <:masutaspear:643166903220699137> **Masuta's Warspear**
    • Rare drop

**__Phase 1__**
⬥ **Attack Rotation**
Autoattacks → Hurricane → Autoattacks → <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Autoattacks** - Mostly Melee-based although he can also uncommonly use Ranged instead. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing.

*His ranged auto-attacks*

.
.img:https://imgur.com/VrBObJ5.mp4
.
*Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG.*

.
⬥ **Hurricane** - Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ekzDcm3.mp4
.
The best way to deal with this is <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> + <:devo:513190158728953857> 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take.

*Note: It’s possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack.*

.
⬥**Tsunami** - After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/zHMArnZ.mp4
.
This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> + Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using <:surge:535533810004262912> as the autoattack before the <:tsunami:535533809995874304> hits.

.
*Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> unlocked, it is possible to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> and flick Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami*

.

*Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it.*

.
<:surge:535533810004262912> timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0
.
*Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, <:tsunami:535533809995874304> will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking.*

.
⬥ **Pulverise** - After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text "I'll pulverise you!" appears over Masuta.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/LvR5mBE.mp4
.
*Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k.*

.
**__Flight Phase__**
⬥ Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Fe0ihJk.mp4
.
⬥ Shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. for the duration of this special attack.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/YNvhBSU.mp4
.
⬥ When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/gvMdd2v.mp4
.
*Notes: You can use a lossless <:devo:513190158728953857> here to reduce damage taken. You must be near 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends.*

.
**__Phase 2__**
Starts when Masuta yells "These waters will choke you where you stand!" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack.

⬥ The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/W6v0V4g.mp4
.
    • The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6.
    • The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> → <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> → <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> → <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> → repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used.

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ **Phase 1 Notes**
    • Due to the rng nature of Masuta's attack pattern, this fight heavily involves improvising rotations especially when paired up with <:tsunami:535533809995874304> crit buff procs.
    • It's recommended to kite Masuta during p1 until his Hurricane attack ends and then start <:sunshine:994921119381463070> rotation

*Notes: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channelled abilities. You may have to use <:devo:513190158728953857> or abandon your <:sunshine:994921119381463070> if Masuta does an early 2nd Hurricane.*

.
⬥ **Flight Phase**
    • Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727>, the waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise <:bd:535532854281764884> and <:surge:535533810004262912> when moving from water to water.
    • Make sure to stand near the waters when they die to make the next phase safer.
    • You should apply <:Vuln:537349530551582720> and <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> on Masuta just before the phase ends.
    • It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts.

*Notes: Save limitless for Seiryu. Make sure to move closer to Masuta when using <:tsunami:535533809995874304> since it has a short range.*

**__Defence Pylons__**
⬥ There are only three defense pylons that you need to kill to open the final barrier. Ignore the first 4 pylons and <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> to the middle platform.
⬥ You should kill the three pylons which are opposite of the bank chest. <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> the middle one and <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> another one. Finish with <:sonic:535533809924571136> / <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>.
⬥ The pylons can hit surprisingly high so you should pray mage and use a lossless <:devo:513190158728953857> before targeting them.
⬥ It's important to have 91+ adrenaline when entering the upcoming boss fight so don't use <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on the pylons.
⬥ Try to eat some food before withdrawing preset so you don't enter the boss fight at very low health
⬥ <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> down the bridge to enter the final boss arena.

To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics.

**__Drops__**
⬥ <:ancientscale:643162215137935360> **Ancient Scale**
    • Common drop, 4-110 dropped per kill
    • Averages to roughly 15 scales per kill
⬥ <:chippedcrystal:643162482126356520> **Chipped Black Stone Crystal**
    • 1/300 base, 60 threshold

*Note: The above drop rates are strictly for solo encounters.*

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Overview**
    • This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight.
    • Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed.

⬥ **Attack Rotations**
*Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows:*
    • Huge Breath → 2 attacks → Shadow Energy → 2 attacks → repeat
    • The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic.

⬥ **Tail Blackholes** - Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/zwFuDq4.mp4
.
⬥ **Huge Breath** - When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message "Seiryu takes a huge breath" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/fsznjRq.mp4
.
You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or use Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and tank it.

.
⬥ **Shadow Energy** - When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message "Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu." appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/0NPw0Ot.mp4
.
Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path.

.
⬥ **Black Hands** - Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4YRp1Ra.mp4
.
Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent.

.
⬥ **Crystal Phase** - Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic.
    • If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack.
    • During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/6UThIKD.mp4
.
Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/NqEDUWE.mp4
.
When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/c7V97dw.mp4
.
    • You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals.
        - You have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down.
    • As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ **1st Face Phase**
<:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> to the back of the arena (see below) → <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:sunshine:994921119381463070> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:impact:535533809655873556> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deep:535533833139912724> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:impact:535533809655873556> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:deep:535533833139912724> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise until phase hp and go up.

⬥ **1st Face Phase Notes**
    • <:sunshine:994921119381463070> further away from head (East / West) so you can dodge Seiryu's tendril attack without leaving Flank <:flank4:712073088296157185> range.
    • You can dump adrenaline with <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> at the end of the phase if you're comfortable with killing the 1st crystal without <:sunshine:994921119381463070>
    • Be ready to move away from south wall at ~50s mark when the Black Hands start appearing.
    • For learners it's recommended to use <:sunshine:994921119381463070> at the middle of the arena for better view of the special attacks.

⬥ **Crystals 1st Cycle**
    • Kill 1st crystal without using dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968>. You can simply use ice wrack and thresholds to kill it easily. Using <:sunshine:994921119381463070> is also an option if necessary.
    • Doing proper damage to the middle crystal on the 1st cycle is the key to being able to get a 2 cycle.
    • It can't be stressed enough: Do not jump down to deal with the blobs in any circumstance.

⬥ **Middle Crystal Rotation**
Make sure the middle crystal has <:Vuln:537349530551582720> and <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> (DW) + dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> on the 4th heal → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:onsl:513190159085207555>→ Cancel <:onsl:513190159085207555> with <:dbreath:535533833391702017> after you HP goes below 4k.

*Note: It is a good idea to stack hp boosts like bonfire, Sailfish <:Sailfish:565726489363087360> and Font of Life <:fontoflife:698225967679930408> for this strategy to get most out of onslaught.*

.
⬥ **2nd Face Phase**
<:freedom:535541258240786434> → Target a blob in the middle row → <:gchain:787904334495088672> <:caroming4:791281588792590336> → <:comb:535533833098100745> → Target Seiryu <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> → Apply <:Vuln:537349530551582720> + <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> and build to 100% adren → <:sunshine:994921119381463070> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:impact:535533809655873556> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deep:535533833139912724> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:impact:535533809655873556> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:conc:535533833106489365> → <:deep:535533833139912724> <:flank4:712073088296157185> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → improvise until phase hp.

⬥ **2nd Face Phase Notes**
    • If the blob you used <:gchain:787904334495088672> on dies before you get to use <:comb:535533833098100745> you have to use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and <:dbreath:535533833391702017> to clear out the remaining blobs.
    • You can use <:tsunami:535533809995874304> at around 7.230M hp for the crit buff for the last crystal phase.
    • Be mindful of phasing too early in case your <:sunshine:994921119381463070> isn't ready for the start of crystals.

.
⬥ **Crystals 2nd Cycle**
    • Go up to the other side that has a full hp crystal.
    • Do a standard <:sunshine:994921119381463070> rotation and remember to use dominion mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> on the first crystal.
    • The final middle crystal should have <50k hp from previous cycle. Finish it off with <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> + <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> + <:wm:535533809978966037>
    • If you fail to finish off the crystals you will have to do a third cycle. This is however very unlikely unless you make a major mistake.

    • Save your adrenaline potion <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> for usage on the crystals. These may salvage your one cycle rotation, should you get unlucky with critical hits.
    • Build to 12 exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> stacks prior to going up to the crystals.
    • Inability to follow the rotation may result in failure.
