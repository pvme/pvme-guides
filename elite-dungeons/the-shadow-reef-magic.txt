**__Introduction__**
The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>, which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>

This guide is structured in the order that rooms would be encountered if running the dungeon. Rotations are written to utilize the Greater Chain ability <:gchain:787904334495088672> and assume 4TAA is used; however, neither is required to effectively do this dungeon.

.
Each solo run of ED3 is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!E568$ in eldritch pieces. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B572$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C572$ gp/hr.

> __**Presets**__
.tag:presets
*Note: The dungeon can be effectively run with a single preset but for general speed reasons a separate preset should be used for Ambassador.*

Use either Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> or Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> here depending on speed and clean up with autos and bleeds.

.
As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, largely negated with Weapon Poison active.

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poison Pits + Additional Heads** - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the Leviathan. Never stand here.

.
⬥ **Dragon Breath** - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage. Stand off to the side to avoid this.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/RCt6T7m.mp4
.
⬥ **Head Sweep** - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5sWppnG.mp4
.
⬥ After going through one **Dragon Breath** and two sets of **Head Sweeps**, the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation.
    • Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the opposite end of the arena.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/3iANozs.mp4
.
__**Strategy**__
⬥ Aim to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> right away either directly in front of the Leviathan's nose or on the same tile you throw vuln bombs to (directly east of the Leviathan's head). Both spots allow for you to safely hit the boss in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> while avoiding the Head Sweep special. Drink your apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and look to use <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778>.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/mdNKxWN.png
.
⬥ At this point the Head Sweep will have started. Use an Guthix Staff spec <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> either before or after you move to dodge the Head Sweep followed by a Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> after dodging once. Get in another <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> before you <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> ends.

.
⬥ After your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> ends, try to just use thresholds to do damage up until it switches sides. If your damage doesn't look too great when you hit about the 1 minute mark, try to build to high adren to use a Metaphoris <:meta:535533811304497183> + Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> immediately after the switch. Otherwise look to finish the boss off with more thresholds and Guthix Staff specs <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> after the switch.

*Note: Leviathan switching sides counts as walking for Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> so look to use that as one of your last abilities on the initial side.*

**__Room 9__**
Drink your Acceleration Powerburst <:accel:756236265472524418> exiting the Leviathan and utilize surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> as demonstrated below to quickly reach this room. There is a Cloaked Zealot and various Scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> the Zealot and use Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> followed by Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>. If your <:gchain:787904334495088672> does not hit all the Scuttlers, you may want to use Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> before <:dbreath:535533833391702017>. Diagonally bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> into the next room.

**__Room 10__**
Put your salve amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> back on. In the middle of the room, tag a Zombie with gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> and charge Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> (tc) <:dbreath:535533833391702017>.

.
**__Room 11__**
Jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. Use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the Necromancer to clear the entire room.

.
**__Room 12__**
There are two Necromancers off at the sides and a line of three Armoured Zombies guarding the door. You only need to kill one Necromancer and the Zombies to proceed to section 2, the temple area. Run to the archway and surge <:surge:535533810004262912> straight before diagonally bladed diving <:bd:535532854281764884> towards a Necromancer. Kill the Necromancer with Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> → Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>. Use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> on an Armoured Zombie and charge Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>.

**__Room 1__**
There are two Ulthven Necromancers guarding the gates to the east and west that you must clear to access the black stone artefacts. The main gate will not drop until these have been activated. A mass of summoned skeletons will form in the room as you go about this task.

Equip your <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> and surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> down the path. Go west first and kill the Necromancer with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017>. <:surge:535533810004262912> through the open barrier to go tag the artefact. <:bd:535532854281764884> diagonally back to the doorway and <:surge:535533810004262912> through. Kill the east Necromancer with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the doorway. Go tag the artefact then run back and <:bd:535532854281764884> diagonally towards the bridge.

**__Room 2__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> twice down the bridge to the two Sea Horrors and a Necromancer that you must clear to proceed. Use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> on the east Horror while running to the far northeast corner. Charge Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> on the west Horror → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>. The Necromancer should die to AoE during this clear but kill with basics if it suvives. Diagonally bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the next hallway afterwards.

*Note: It is ok to use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> here, but it should ideally be before reaching the Horrors.*

**__Room 3__**
There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. Tag the northernmost Acolyte with gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> and use Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> before switching targets. Finish off the survivors with Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>. Immediately after clearing this room, drink your Acceleration Powerburst <:accel:756236265472524418> to bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> back to back to back as demonstrated below.

Put your salve amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> back on and use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> on the western Necromancer. Finish off what's left with basics, but try not to use Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> as it will stop your from banking at the chest.

.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> , Undead Slayer perk <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> purposes.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** -  This Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode for heavy typeless damage to the player. Prevented by killing it.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Xq8JxyR.mp4
.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each.
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive
.
.img:https://imgur.com/L3klbH8.mp4
.
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/LeJAsiN.mp4
.
        - Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed.
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards.
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket.

.
⬥ **Spirit Line** - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact.
    • Move out of the way as needed be.

__**Strategy**__
⬥ Utilizing 4TAA with Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> will make a world of difference in this fight in particular allowing players to essentially tank almost everything, especially on Mahjarrat Aura <:mahj:643148943856762890> rather than Maniacal <:mani:643505153709965322>.  With <:mani:643505153709965322>, the last 300k can be sketchy at times; however, it is very much worth using.

.
⬥ Start out the fight with an apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and your salve amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> equipped.
<:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> <:wm:535533809978966037> (→ <:asphyx:535533833072672778> if Taraket is still above 200k hp)

<:asphyx:535533833072672778>/<:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> the Rift → <:gchain:787904334495088672> to clear the skeletons → <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> + <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> <:comb:535533833098100745> the Bloated Monstrosity → run back to just west of where Taraket was before flying and charge <:deto:535533833358016512> on him

.
<:deto:535533833358016512> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (→ <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> if not phased but try to stay high adren)

*Note: Where you stand is important here as you're looking to body block Taraket from flying west.*

⬥ Equip <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> on the Bloated Monstrosity and build back to 100 to <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>

.
<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> back on Taraket and build with 2 basics → <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → step to the other side of Taraket before the Corpse Carrier reaches melee distance to effective stack it on top of Taraket

.
*Note: Stacking Corpse Carrier in this way is not 100% guranteed and it is very important that you move back through Taraket to restack if it does not work.*

.
<:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → (<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> ends)

.
⬥ From here finish off taraket with more thresholds and <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>. Be sure to side step the melee hits from the Spirit Line special as they will severly hurt your ability to outheal the majority of the damage you take. Also use <:gchain:787904334495088672> off cooldown (preferably before thresholds or <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>) to improve overall healing and to repeatedly clear out the skeletal mobs the Corpse Carrier spawns. A second rift will spawn but you should be killing Taraket before it explodes so you can generally ignore it.

⬥ The Dark Form <:darkform:659122103269982228> prayer is helpful here especially if using Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787>.

.
*Note: Untested but players who do not 4TAA can likely follow this strategy up until when the Corpse Carrier spawns, at which point they would want to focus it down while in Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.*

*Note: This section and the following section can be cleared fairly easily with little to no food. As such, do not bank after Taraket even if running low.*

**__Room 5__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> out of Taraket's room. There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Tag the Witch with gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Asphxyiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>/Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>/Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> depending on cooldowns following Taraket. <:surge:535533810004262912> into the next room.

**__Room 6__**
Put back on your Essence of Finality <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>. Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss. If you have it, the Demon Slayer ability <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> can be used here. Guthix staff (dw) <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>/Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> should be enough. The Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> ability can be used here if you already own it. After killing the demon, look to utilize surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and an Acceleration Powerburst <:accel:756236265472524418> as demonstrated below.

.
*Note: You can manipulate one of the required Necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. This isn’t 100% guaranteed.*

.
**__Room 7__**
There's two Necromancers hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Use either Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> or Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> followed by Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> on the west Necromancer then surge <:surge:535533810004262912> back towards the east Necromancer. If low on Hp or food use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the east Necromancer, otherwise simply <:asphyx:535533833072672778>. Diagonally bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> through the corner into the next room and keep running to angle yourself for the next surge <:surge:535533810004262912>.

**__Room 8__**
Only the two Necromancers are guarding the gate here. Kill the first Necromancer with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Sonic <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> then surge <:surge:535533810004262912> diagonally through the corner to the second Necromancer. Kill it with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> → Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and diagonally bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> through the corner to the cliff.

**__Room 1__**
Use surge <:surge:535533810004262912> twice to reach the group of Crassian Warriors and Scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. They stack up very nicely for all AoEs and aren't very threatening in general. Tag a Warrior with gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> on your way to the barrier and charge a Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> (→ <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:wm:535533809978966037> if bad <:deto:535533833358016512>). Improvise to finish off the survivors.

.
**__Room 2__**
There's two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. Equip your salve amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> the two Skeletons. Proceed to <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → (tc skeleton 2) <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>. Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into the next room and immediately bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> behind the line of Zealots.

.
**__Room 3__**
Re-equip your Essence of Finality <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> and use gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> on either one of the eastern Zealots or Skeleton if close. From here use <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> then improvise to finish off the stragglers ideally with Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>.

.
**__Room 4__**
The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so try to avoid them by hugging the western wall. Ideally look to gChain <:gchain:787904334495088672> the Skeletons → Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>/Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>. Build on the Scouts to ensure you have full adren for Ambassador.

*Note: If no minibosses spawn in this room, look to zoom to the door and <:gchain:787904334495088672> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> all 4 mobs.*

At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits Kranon, the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, self-healing, and the usage multiple combat styles.

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

__**Ambassador's Attack Rotation**__
⬥ **1M HP to 550K - Phase 1**
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat
*Magic Auto-Attack*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/1oX424k.mp4
.
⬥ **550K to 400K - Phase 2**
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.

.
⬥ **Ritual - Kill**
    • 5 autos → Melee/Magic → 5 autos → Melee/Magic → Onslaught

.
**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple Corruption**
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head.
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase.
    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks.
        - These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5bWwQXr.mp4
.
⬥ **Black Hole**
    • The Ambassador will spawn a black hole near the area that will explode a few seconds afterwards, dealing 8000+ damage to the player
    • Despawned by stunning it.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/KkpYl0Z.mp4
.
⬥ **Sinister Fragments**
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute.
        - Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a hard hitting typeless explotion per fragment absorbed.
    • The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight **or** by hitting the 650K cap.

*Burn! Like the ants you are.*

**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ The Ambassador stops spawning Sinister Fragments.
⬥ The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> harder to use.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GuVOe7f.mp4
.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics, continuing his auto attack pattern as normal.
⬥ Seiryu will emerge shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.
⬥ A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena.
    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the Ambassador.
    • These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player.

**__General Tips__**
⬥ Use a Ripper demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls and drink Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787>.

⬥ Try to avoid using solid food. Stick to Blue jellies <:blueblubber:689530593742291033>, and Guthix rest <:grest:689530593901412578> or Saradomin brews <:Brew:565726489400573962>, if you can.

.
⬥ Try to maximize the potential healing from soulsplitting <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> Spinners and the Seiryu Heal at 400k to cut down on food usage throughout the fight. Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> can also be used on the magic auto attack occasionally to preserve food.

⬥ You will need to Spellbook Swap <:SBS:543875425055670275> to use Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> throughout the fight. Bring runes accordingly.

⬥ Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be utilized throughout the fight by stepping directly underneath the Ambassador.

.
**__Phase 1 - 1M-650k HP__**
*Note: Most autos and basics will be omitted in the rotations below. If either is listed below, the timing achieved is intentional. Also all Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> are charged for 3 ticks.*

.
⬥ **Magic 1st Auto vs Melee 1st Auto**
    • Doing <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> (during gcd) to reach melee distance instantly at the start of the fight will switch the 1st auto into a melee auto.
    • Changing the 1st auto into a melee auto changes the timing of the 1st smoke.
        - Mage 1st auto leads to a 22.8s (38t) 1st smoke drop.
        - Melee 1st auto leads to a 31.8s (53t) 1st smoke drop.
    • No other timings are changed.

*Note: The rotation in this guide assumes Magic 1st auto for timings.*

    • Use Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> while running down the ramp
<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → run to the north/northwest corner of your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> while waiting to auto → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778>

.
⬥ **Phase 1 Tips**
    • Try to place the 2nd smoke next to your 1st smoke. This will put them out of the way as after spinners you will primarily stay south/southwest of Ambassador while also leaving a large path on the east side for pathing during spinners.
    • If you switch prayers properly and <:res:535541258844635148> the last magic auto attack, it is fairly straight forward to no food phase 1 starting from full hp.
    • Depending on where the black hole spawns, you may need to start moving early to reach it in time.
        - Be careful that you do not stall then cancel <:impact:535533809655873556>.
        - Having the flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> perk equipped will cause <:impact:535533809655873556> to not clear the black hole.

**__Phase 2 - Spinners__**
⬥ **Spinner Strategy** (not all basics listed)
    • 1st: <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • 2nd: <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>
    • 3rd: <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • 4th: <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • 5th: <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> → basics
    • 6th: ignore and build on Ambassador

.
⬥ **Spinners Tips**
    • You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148> to block the explosion hit.
    • No movement abilities are required to effectively move between spinners; however, if desired, it is recommended to use Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> as its cooldown will be reset by each spinner death.
    • Using Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> on each of the spinners is not necessary but recommended.
    • The spinners are not immune to binds and therefore Ice Barrage + Wrack <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:535533809823645697> can be utilized.

.
**__Phase 3 - 650k-400k__**
⬥ **Natural Instinct Sunshine** <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> → 3-4 basics → <:disrupt:535614336207552523> the eruption → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (5th magic auto) → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3rd smoke timer start) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → move

<:wm:535533809978966037> → (6th magic auto) <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → clear black hole with <:impact:535533809655873556> immediately

build with basics → (7th magic auto) <:deto:535533833358016512> (if bad adren skip <:deto:535533833358016512> to not delay next <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> (dw) <:asphyx:535533833072672778>

.
⬥ **Phase 3 Tips**
    • If you are confident in your ability to <:res:535541258844635148> on tick, you can <:res:535541258844635148> the 7th magic auto here to save food.
    • Try to end this phase on very low hp for a large heal from Seiryu but beware as flicking to <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> to block a magic auto will still cost you somewhere around 2-3k hp.

.
**__Phase 4 - Ritual (400k-0 HP)__**
⬥ **General Strategy**
    • Blocking the Healing Smoke
        - Understand your character as a wedge when blocking smoke. You can always block 2 smoke directions at once so whenever you have to move, rather than moving to block the current smoke, move to block the current smoke *and the next smoke*. For this reason it is also more beneficial to move to melee distance for this phase.
        - Alternatively you can spam click under him to block all of the healing smoke without needing to move, though this is also the most click-intensive and difficult thing you can do.
    • Blocking Magic Onslaught (from most to least ideal)
        - Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857>
        - Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Vitality Powerburst <:vitality:654618235097972737>
        - Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729>
        - Vitality Powerburst <:vitality:654618235097972737> + Shield Dome <:sd:537341954392850442>

*Note: <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sd:537341954392850442> is very dangerous and is only to save kills following misjudgements. You should never want to use this method. Timing a <:res:535541258844635148> for hp or using <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to block the 1st hit of Magic Onslaught also helps this method but adds even more risk.*

.
⬥ **Apot Sunshine** <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Run underneath and activate Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
        - This will allow you to move to block smokes while remaining in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> (sun ends)

    • Use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to block the Magic Onslaught

*Note: Very unideal but depending on the timing you may need to activate Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> to <:devo:513190158728953857>.*

.
⬥ **Last 100k or So**
    • Depending on the hp remaining, you have 3 options here.
        - The right option is a judgement call and takes practice.
        - Factors to consider include: hp remaining, food remaining, <:limitless:641339233638023179> availability, dps, and confidence

.
    • **Safe and Slow** - use a thresh or 2 then build to Sunshine
<:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> → build (save <:limitless:641339233638023179>) + eat

<:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:reflect:535541258786177064> + <:vitality:654618235097972737> the 2nd Magic Onslaught (may come before or after asphyx) → improvise with thresh

        - This option is slow as it generally will not finish the kill until some time after the 2nd Magic Onslaught; however, this option is the safest as it always has access to a safe approach to dealing with the Onslaught.

.
    • **All-in for the Skip** - use a thresh then build to <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:meta:535533811304497183>
<:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:meta:535533811304497183> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> 2 basics → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>

        - This option should be fairly consistent in skipping; however, it leaves you in a bad way if you fail the skip with the only option being to resort to <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sd:537341954392850442>.
        - Example: <https://youtu.be/sjP9TMF_0nM>

.
    • **Speed** - assuming hp remaining is fairly low, spam thresh and Guthix Staff EoF <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> to kill before 2nd Magic Onslaught
<:deto:535533833358016512> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> → improvise

        - This option is the fastest as it is not restricted by <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> cooldown.
        - If you choose this option and fail to skip the 2nd Magic Onslaught, eat up and use <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sd:537341954392850442> to hopefully survive.
        - If you choose this method and consistently fail to skip, consider trying the All-in method.
