> __**General Tips**__
.tag:general
While you are free to use any style you want, this guide is going to look in depth at clearing the dungeon with melee. In general fast melee ED1 runs are determined by your ability to maximise the effectiveness of your AoE damage by positioning the enemy NPCs and yourself optimally, along with your ability to output large amounts of single-target damage during bossfights.

Once learned and mastered, running this dungeon will provide a consistent source of GP, making it an immensely rewarding experience.

.
**__Things to Know__**
â¬¥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Mobile Perk <:mob:689501908628799488>, and having Double Surge <:surgecodex:602561894414417944> unlocked are essential for maximising speed.
â¬¥ There are two NPCs with strong special attacks, Hanto Sellwords and Death Lotus Rogues. Dealing correctly with them is important to minimise risk.
â¬¥ Keep track of the HP of all the important(barrier-unlocking) NPCs. This prevents wasteful usage of abilities.
â¬¥ As quite a number of mobs in this dungeon will stun you, incorporating Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> into your rotations is strongly advised.
â¬¥ The Corbicula Rex <:corbicula:690136117273821280> perk (112 Farming) in ROoT is extremely helpful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is frequently used here.

Start with 100% adrenaline from the PvM hub.

**__Room 1__**
â¬¥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> with your Mobile Switch <:mob:689501908628799488> equipped, then run down the stairs and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> towards the tile at the centre.
    â€¢ During the Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> click diagonally and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> targetting one specific Elite Sotapanna (shown below), follow up with an Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> (bled) on the one south of your position, Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> the Sotapanna you barged and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> â†’ Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> the other 2 enemies.
    â€¢ Save Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> for later.

.
**__Room 2__**
â¬¥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> all the way east to the area with nine Elite Sotapannas.
    â€¢ These enemies use Melee, so have them gather around you.
â¬¥ With a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>, use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>, Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> to finish off any remaining enemies.
    â€¢ Save Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> for the next room.

.
**__Room 3__**
â¬¥ Go east, Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the northern Elite Sakadagami, bleed an Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> (dw) on it and drop 2 of your Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968>.
â¬¥ Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and equip your Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> while positioning yourself right in front of the middle Sakadagami and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> â†’ Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> targetting the southern one.
    â€¢ Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> should explode on the middle enemy, if it does not kill him, finish him with one strong basic.
    â€¢ You will probably finish this room with 100% adrenaline due to the Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> you used earlier.

With your Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> equipped, Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the Elite Sotapanna (standing in the centre) and Sever <:sever:535532879577612298> him.
â¬¥ Position yourself one tile southeast of him (marked as an X below), Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> the northernmost enemy you can reach, use one more basic (prioritise hitting the healer) and Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> a Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> into the southernmost Sakadagami.
â¬¥ Walk to the mirrored version of the spot you currently are and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> AoE down who is left alive.
    â€¢ Remember to position yourself optimally to hit multiple enemies with Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>.

â¬¥ Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> should be off cooldown by now, use it if you are close to 100% adrenaline.
    â€¢ Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> otherwise.

**__Room 3__**
â¬¥ Sip you Acceleration Powerburst <:accel:756236265472524418> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> (ignoring the flying Arhats/Anagami) all the way to the southern end of the room.
â¬¥ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the middle Elite Sakadagami on the right side of the arena. Drop 2 Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> and use Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>.
â¬¥ Finish off any remaining Sakadagamis with basics in order to end this section at 100% adrenaline.
â¬¥ After the barrier is unlocked, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the line marked in red to lure all Arhats/Anagami.
    â€¢ You can start the rotation while they are moving to the lure spot.

*Note: Avoid using Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> here as you will be using Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> soon.*

The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared.

Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand south of the boss, otherwise Arhats/Anagami will aggro you and AoEs will not work (<:cleave:535532878616985610>, <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

.
**__Drops__**
â¬¥ <:fishytreat:643167044887642122> **Fishy treat**
    â€¢ Rare drop
â¬¥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx dust**
    â€¢ Common drop, 1-34 dropped per kill

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
â¬¥ **Attack Rotations**
    â€¢ 4x Ranged autoattack to start the fight
    â€¢ Water Burst â†’ Ranged auto â†’ Water Jet â†’ Ranged auto â†’ Purple Smoke â†’ Autoattack â†’ repeat
    â€¢ After the 4th water jet attack, 2 Crassian Reinforcements are summoned. They deal negligible ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway.

*Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> during the attacks travel time if necessary.*

.
â¬¥ **Ranged Autoattacks** - A projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hits everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot.
    â€¢ As it is targetted to a tile rather than the player and has a travel time before it hits, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands though this is normally not necessary.

.
â¬¥ **Water Burst** - A high-hitting melee attack.
    â€¢ Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic.
    â€¢ Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, or using Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> if you need the extra healing.

.
How to avoid the water burst attack - https://youtu.be/3xDLQIAMeEc
.
*Note: For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking.*

.
â¬¥ **Water Jet** - A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise.
    â€¢ Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage.
    â€¢ This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> or blocking with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>.

.
How to avoid the water jet with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> - https://youtu.be/mlPkDWGGmb8
.
*Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> and pray Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> here.*

.
â¬¥ **Purple Smoke** - The most dangerous attack of the boss
    â€¢ A blue bar will appear above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location.
    â€¢ After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death.
    â€¢ The Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight.
        - It is recommended to use Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> at the correct time to place the Purple Smoke next to the southern wall.
        - If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> into a Purple Smoke you've placed previously.

*Note: If you fail to get through without getting the aggro of the two Death Lotus Rogues, turn on Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and eat up. Do not use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> here as it will be necessary in Masuta's fight.

Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss.

.
**__Drops__**
â¬¥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx dust**
    â€¢ Common drop, 1-29 dropped per kill
â¬¥ <:masutaspear:643166903220699137> **Masuta's warspear**
    â€¢ Rare drop

.
**__Phase 1__**
.
â¬¥ **Attack Rotation**
Autoattacks â†’ Hurricane â†’ Autoattacks â†’ Tsunami â†’ repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
â¬¥ **Autoattacks:** Mostly Melee-based although he can also uncommonly use Ranged instead. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing.

*Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG.*

.
â¬¥ **Hurricane:**  Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack.

The best way to deal with this is <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> + <:devo:513190158728953857> 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take.

*Note: Its possible to flank Masuta from the north side during this attack.*

.
â¬¥ **Tsunami:** After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks, alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters.

This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> + Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits.

.
*Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> unlocked, it is possible to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> and flick Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami.*

.

.
*Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it.*

.
Surge timing demonstration - https://youtu.be/qrcCqidKhe0
.
*Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking.*

.
â¬¥ **Pulverise**
After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text "I'll pulverise you!" appears over Masuta.

*Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k.*

.
**__Flight phase__**
Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable, shortly after Masuta will start spawning thrashing waters at random locations in the arena. These have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over a 90s span. Pray Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. for the duration of this special attack.

When a thrashing water is killed, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm Waters buff that will help you for Phase 2.

.
*Notes: Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> here to reduce damage taken. Before the phase ends, you can use the Dragon Battleaxe special attack <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> to speed up phase 2. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends.*

.
**__Phase 2__**
Starts when Masuta yells "These waters will choke you where you stand!" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack.

â¬¥ The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm Waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack.
    â€¢ The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack ranges from 3 to 6.
    â€¢ The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> â†’ <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> â†’ <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> â†’ <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> â†’ repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used.

.
**__Strategy__**
â¬¥ **Phase 1:** <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> â†’ <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> â†’ <:cleave:535532878616985610> â†’ <:assault:535532853979512842> â†’ <:destroy:535532879330148352> â†’
    â€¢ If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel <:destroy:535532879330148352> with <:deci:535532879325822986> + <:surge:535533810004262912>/<:bd:535532854281764884> away, stall <:cleave:535532878616985610> from out of distance -> run back in and release <:cleave:535532878616985610> with <:devo:513190158728953857>.
    â€¢ If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s. When Masuta starts his Hurricane, time <:devo:513190158728953857> appropriately.
    â€¢ Make sure to use Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> during his Hurricane mechanic.
    â€¢ Aim for a 40s-ish phase here. This will make your kill quick and smooth.
â¬¥ Build with strong basics until <:zerk:535532854004678657> ends, then <:dismember:535532879376023572> â†’ <:slaughter:535532879237873666> â†’ <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> â†’ <:deci:535532879325822986> â†’ <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> â†’ 188s until 30% adrenaline, after which <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:destroy:535532879330148352> â†’ <:assault:535532853979512842>. Finish the phase with strong basics.
*Note: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities.*

.
â¬¥ **Flight Phase:**
    â€¢ Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727>, the waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> when moving from water to water.
    â€¢ Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> when ~60 seconds of the flight phase have passed, build to 100% adrenaline and Dragon Battleaxe Spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>, build back to 100% adrenaline with basics.
        - It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts.

.
*Note: You can use Balanced Strike <:balancedstrike:535532854336290826> on the beginning of the phase if you find yourself low on HP. You will have enough time to build back to 100% in order to Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> and the HP gained will sustain you throughout the phase.*

.
â¬¥ **Phase 2:**
    â€¢ If you are going for the non-EoF 1 cycle or 2 cycle rotation: <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> â†’ <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> â†’ <:cleave:535532878616985610> â†’ <:assault:535532853979512842> â†’ <:destroy:535532879330148352> â†’ <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) â†’ build with basics until <:zerk:535532854004678657> ends â†’ <:dismember:535532879376023572> â†’ <:slaughter:535532879237873666> â†’ <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> â†’ <:deci:535532879325822986> â†’ <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> â†’ finish off with strong basics.

To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics.

.
**__Drops__**
â¬¥ <:ancientscale:643162215137935360> **Ancient scale**
    â€¢ Common drop, 4-110 dropped per kill
â¬¥ <:chippedcrystal:643162482126356520> **Chipped black stone crystal**
    â€¢ 1/300 base, 60 threshold
*Note: The above is strictly for solo encounters.*

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
â¬¥ **Overview**
    â€¢ This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.500M to 7.200M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight.
    â€¢ Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed.

.
â¬¥ **Tail Blackholes**
    â€¢ Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area (centered northeast). It will deal rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to anyone standing within the targeted area. It will last for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it.

.
â¬¥ **Attack Rotations**
*Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows:*
    â€¢ Huge Breath â†’ 2 attacks â†’ Shadow Energy â†’ 2 attacks â†’ repeat
    â€¢ The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic.

.
â¬¥ **Huge Breath**
    â€¢ When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message "Seiryu takes a huge breath" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or use Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and tank it.

.
â¬¥ **Shadow Energy**
    â€¢ When Seiryu's Shadow Energy mechanic starts, the game message "Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu." appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena, and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Dodge these hands by simply moving out of their path.

.
â¬¥ **Black Hands**
    â€¢ Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. These hands deal extremely high damage, avoiding them is vital. They will spawn from a random point on the south wall and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this mechanic has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, death is imminent.

.
â¬¥ **Crystal Phase**
    â€¢ Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of any remaining mechanic and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his rotation from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his Huge Breath mechanic.
    â€¢ If Seiryu used his Huge Breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will do 1 basic attack then his Huge Breath attack.
    â€¢ During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and slowly move towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches his face, it will heal any standing crystal by 50k HP. You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals (you have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down). As you get back to the floor a second set of enigmas will have spawned, if you left any crystal alive and damaged, deal with them before attacking Seiryu.

.
**__General Tips__**
â¬¥ 1 cycling consistently results in faster kills, but 2 cycling is far easier.
â¬¥ Any familiar larger than 1x1, such as the Ripper Demon, will not be able to directly attack the crystals.
â¬¥ Keep in mind that you can use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> on Seiryu from the south edge of the arena.
â¬¥ You will not be attacked while on Seiryu's shackle, avoid healing to make the most out of your Berserker's Fury relic.
â¬¥ Using Zamorak Brews to lower down your own HP during crystal phase is highly recommended in order to utilise even more your Berserker's Fury relic.
â¬¥ It may be worth to tank the Tail Blackhole first hits in order to finish a channeled threshold or use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185>.

Optimally when Seiryu reaches 7,200M HP, you will have 100% adrenaline ready for the crystal phase. With this in mind, decide on which/how many thresholds to use depending on how much damage you've dealt to the boss. If your damage output is high, prioritise <:gflurry:535532879283879977> to ensure <:zerk:535532854004678657> is off cooldown for the crystal phase.

*Note: Avoid using Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> when Seiryu is close to 7,200M, or else it'll be on cooldown for the first crystal rotation.*

.
â¬¥ When Seiryu phases at 7,200M HP, Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to either side's jump spot (shown below) and spam-click the jump option on the shackle platform.

â¬¥ Before the wave of heals reaches the crystals, you must have used a fully channeled <:gflurry:535532879283879977> twice and be on 100% adrenaline.

> **__Introduction to 1 Cycle Seiryu__**
.tag:1cycle
**__General Tips__**
â¬¥ These are not the best ways to go for a 1-cycle as a "one time thing", it is a way to finish the dungeon quickly to boost runs/hour.
â¬¥ BiS or near BiS gear is heavily recommended for consistency.
â¬¥ If you are willing to use a separate preset for the Seiryu fight alone, useful items to bring for 1-cycles in particular are:
    â€¢ Deathtouch Bracelet <:DTB:513190159429271562>
    â€¢ Armour spikes (alloy) <:armourspike:756235792053174332>
    â€¢ Dreadnips. <:nip:537336877900890135>
    â€¢ Zamorak Brews
â¬¥ Even though you cannot use your Ripper Demon directly on the Crystal, its passive will be more helpful than bringing a 1x1 familiar.
â¬¥ If you have a Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> make sure to use it during the cast of all 2H abilities and bled Assaults <:assault:535532853979512842> while on the Crystals.

*Note: Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> should be used ASAP. You can only afford to lose up to 3 ticks (from climbing/GCD) by this point without having to either alter your rotation for the 3rd crystal or skip using Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> here entirely.*
