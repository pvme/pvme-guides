> **__How to Use Upgrade Order__**
.tag:intro
The lists above are recommended natural combat style progression templates for players to follow. Upgrades are ranked based on many factors to determine the best progression for general bossing -- that is to say, the listed upgrade order may not be the best order for the bosses you do. Equally problematic, creating individual upgrade orders for every single boss would not work as most players do not do only 1 boss but rather several.

Therefore, the best way to present upgrade order is to present a list and teach how to determine which upgrades are best for you. Below is the current Melee upgrade order at the time of writing (2021/06/24). For this example, the upgrade order will be tailored and annotated for the purposes of killing **Araxxor with Melee** for profit. See <#534514775120412692> for more information about the strategies mentioned and <#566738213004115968> for speed references.

.
**__Araxxor Specific Needs__**
⬥ **Accuracy** - Araxxor has reasonably high defense
    • Prioritize weapons with high accuracy
    • Use the strongest possible accuracy aura (Berserker Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> > T4 Brawler <:brawler:643505376917979138>).

⬥ **Burst** - the Araxxor fight is split into 4 100k hp phases
    • Melee's go to ultimate ability is Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>.
        - Perfect for bursting a phase
        - As you speed up, you will run into cooldown problems
    • Upgrades which improve your burst capabilities are prioritized.

> **__Annotated Upgrade Order for Melee Araxxor__**
.tag:annotated
*Note: All upgrades will be listed in bold. Araxxor will commonly be abbreviated to 'rax'.*

.
**__Stage 1: No Real Variance Based on Content__**
**⬥ Berserker Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290>**
**⬥ Blade of Nymora + off-hand Ripper claw/Masuta's Warspear <:nymorablade:643161612819365888> <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444> / <:masutaspear:643166903220699137>**

Melee benefits heavily from dual wield/2h switching as it gives access to both Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> as well as Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> and later gFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>. A Blade of Nymora offers you a cheap mainhand with T90 accuracy which is important for rax while an offhand Ripper Claw is a cheap offhand with T85 damage. Masuta's Warspear is a 2h with T82 accuracy and damage to be used for <:cleave:535532878616985610> and occasionally Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.

**⬥ Level 95 Prayer <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> <:turmoil:583429936606347280>**
    • Should also complete The Temple at Senntisten quest.
**⬥ Level 99 Herblore <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>**
    • Can boost from 99 to make Elder Overloads with the aid of pulse cores, and can request assistance to make Adrenaline Renewals

Normal Overloads are good but the extra stats from Elder Overloads are definitely worth the price when bossing. Any combination with your Elder Overloads such as making them into Elder Overload Salves is optional.

.
**⬥ Drygores MH + Ripper Claw OH <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> + <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444>**
**⬥ Entry Level Perks <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382> <:ancientarmourgizmo:697405383769194516>**
    • Refer to <#553632787639435284> Starter Perks for Entry Level Perks.

Here you should sell your Blade of Nymora <:nymorablade:643161612819365888> to purchase and a Drygore mainhand <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> to acquire and additional 10 tiers of damage. Your offhand only accounts for 33% of your damage compared to your mainhand's 66% so upgrading your offhand is not recommended yet. Entry level perks also offer a serious damage increase and should be aquired here.

**⬥ Superior Vesta's Spear <:vestaspear:852661743682846720> with Entry Level Perks <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382>**

Superior Vesta's Spear is a T88 2h created by combining a Vesta's Spear with an Ancient Warrior Equipment patch and should be augmented immediately. It uses the same degrade system as T90 armours; however, your first one will likely last you until you reach your next 2h upgrade. You can sell your Masuta's Warspear here or keep it to be used as a halbred for slayer.

**At this point, it would be ok to start trying rax; however, you should expect slow kills.**

.
**⬥ Strength Skillcape <:strcape:689503815296352308>**
    • Primarily beneficial for extended Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> duration.

**All upgrades above this line should be the same for every boss.**

**⬥ T90 Armour <:malevbody:643846996842512405>**

Definitely go for good dps perks on this rather than perks like Scavenging. If you want Scavenging for slayer, put it on a piece of augmented Bandos armour.

**⬥ Laceration Boots <:Laceration:602581988599398400>**
**~~⬥ Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>~~**
    ~~• Skip Cinderbanes if mostly doing poison immune content.~~

Rax is poison immune. If your goal is to mainly do rax, you should skip Cinderbane Gloves.

.
**⬥ Amulet of Souls <:aos:513190158359724056>**
**⬥ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>**
    • Feel free to use the !barge command in <#534563158304620564> for more information.

gBarge is a massive upgrade for rax as it significantly improves your burst capabilities.

**⬥ Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>**

gFlurry improves your overall dps and fills out a basic <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotation.

**At this point you are ready to start using rotations from <#534514775120412692>. You will still need to improvise some rotations, P4 in particular; however, you should notice a serious uptick in your kill speeds. Beware, you should not use the recommended DBA <:DBA:603979368850653216> spec as your accuracy is not high enough yet.**

.
**⬥ Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931>**
**~~⬥ Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>~~**

Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> can commonly be used for your P3 zerk at rax, saving Apot for P4. Limitless is therefore less impactful than it would be at many other bosses and should be purchased later in the list.

.
**__Stage 2: Some Variance Based on Content/Wealth__**
**~~⬥ An off-hand t80 Flanking 4 Switch <:avaryssblade:643161612383158296> <:flank4:712073088296157185>~~**
    ~~• Primarily for group based content, with some niche solo uses, skip if these do not pertain to you.~~

Can't flank rax so you can skip this.

**⬥ Zaros Godsword <:zgs:626465964325601290>**

For rax, this is the most important upgrade as it is the solution to your <:Berserk:513190158468907012> cooldown problem.

**From this point on, you can follow almost all strategies in <#534514775120412692>. Slightly different P2 Top Path (no Masterwork Spear <:masterworkspearofannihilation:694566917456789554>) and P4 rotation (no Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> - substitute <:destroy:535532879330148352> for <:cane:535532878969438210>) are needed. You should be using a Ripper Demon familiar <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> by now. Your gear should be enough to achieve the <@&561637937603936257> times.**

.
**⬥ Masterwork Spear of Annihilation + Lunging <:masterworkspearofannihilation:694566917456789554> <:lunge4:736522494315593759>**
    ~~• If planning to do content where several people will be using melee, skip entirely.~~

Masterwork Spear gives you access to the meta P2 top rotations. It also allows for a better P4 rotation (<:cane:535532878969438210> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> replaces <:destroy:535532879330148352>).

**+⬥ Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>**

Now would be a good time to acquire Limitless for rax. You will use it to clean up your P4 rotation to consistently <:gflurry:535532879283879977> before 25k hp.

.
**⬥ Essence of Finality <:eofred:780401412839833601> ~~(adding Dragon Claws <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:dragonclawoh:779048040865726485> is recommended)~~**

When doing ideal rotations at rax, you do not have the additional adrenaline for EoF special attacks. Instead you are purchasing EoF for the stats and for the Reaper Necklace <:Reaper:513190159412494367> passive. Adding an Ornament Kit is optional and likely not worth until later due to the costs. This <:Reaper:513190159412494367> passive finally provides you the accuracy needed to start using the <:DBA:603979368850653216> top path strat with a Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>.

**⬥ Drygore OH <:rapieroh:656785061072338954>**

**At this point you should closing in on <@&536564440431329281> times; however, they are likely still out of reach.**

.
**⬥ P6AS1 + AS4E2 (or P6R1 on 2h) <:p6:712073088769982475><:as1:689502339891331093> <:as4:712074245202772009><:eq2:689502258424971564> <:ruthless1:712244800924942396>**
    • AS4 is a very strong perk in its own right. If you fail going for AS4E2, feel free to use AS4 in its place for the time being.

AS4 is more than enough for rax. Dont worry if you don't get AS4E2.

**⬥ Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>**
.
**⬥ Custom Fitted Trimmed Masterwork <:tmwbody:536966366272552960>**

By no means a necessity but TMW will make P4 at high enrage less risky.

**~~⬥ Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>~~**
    ~~• Skip if you do not require the halberd range for content. It is this low because generally speaking halberd range is irrelevant. It is still BiS halberd though if you cannot use Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> due to accuracy.~~

Noxious Scythe is generally considered a popular weapon for rax; however, the best rax strategies require dual wield/2h switching -- negating Scythe's only strength, its range. It can still be used as a quality of life during some of the more timegated phases, but for that purpose it should be purchased later on.

.
**__Stage 3: Pretty Low ROI__**
**+⬥ Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> and Ingenuity of the Humans <:ingen:641339234111848463>**

Unlocks the best P4 rotation. IoH is needed to ensure your SGB does not splash. You now have all the gear needed to follow all rotations in <#534514775120412692>.

**+⬥ Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> and Erethdor's Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>**

Terrasaur Maul has very low ROI when compared to most of the upgrades recommended above, and Erethdor's Grimoire is expensive to maintain. However, these two upgrades are most likely to sure up your rotations and ensure you have the damage you need to get over the final hurtles.

**At this point, your gear is capable of consistently achieving <@&536564440431329281> times.**

.
**~~⬥ An off-hand t90 Flanking 4 Switch <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536> <:flank4:712073088296157185>~~**
    ~~• Primarily for group based content, with some niche solo uses, skip if these do not pertain to you.~~
**⬥ Khopesh <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> <:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>**

Khopesh provide a small dps increase. At rax they mostly negate the need for <:quake:535532879506309150> if using <:DBA:603979368850653216>.

.
**⬥ Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527>**

gFury is a quality of life upgrade.

**+⬥ Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>**

If you want it to reduce a bit of damage during timegated phases, get it here.

**~~⬥ Upgrade to Flanking 4 Equilibrium 1 <:flank4:712073088296157185><:eq1:689504357414207490>~~**
    ~~• Primarily for group based content, with some niche solo uses, skip if these do not pertain to you.~~
