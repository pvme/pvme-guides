<:torvabody:643166871285137458> **T80 Armour**
⬥ The standard armour for all PvMing
    • Note: Masterwork, Sirenic, and Superior Zuriels are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of nex armour sets.
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.
<:SuperiorZurielstop:556586037216804864> **T88 Armour**
⬥ Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment
⬥ Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper.
⬥ Priority: `High for Superior Zuriels, low for others`

.
<:masterworkbody:643847056527458324> **T90 Armour**
⬥ Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.
⬥ Priority: `High for Masterwork and Sirenic, low for Tectonic`

.
<:tmwbody:536966366272552960> **T92 Armour**
⬥ The best armour. Relatively small defense and dps boost vs T90 armour.
    • Note: Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time.
    • When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece that will be applied as damage over time.
    • Note: Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.
    • Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches.
    • All three sets do not degrade at Elite Dungeons.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
<:achtoprimevaltop:641344704939819028> **Achto**
⬥ T90 tank armour that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn).
⬥ Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level.
⬥ Generally only use in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
<:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> **Cinderbanes**
⬥ BiS gloves for poisonable targets

⬥ Passive Effect:
    • 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker.
    • Note: Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received.
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
<:spellcaster:643214402169864213> **Dominion Tower Gloves**
⬥ Of these gloves, the only ones that see any niche use in PvM are *Spellcaster Gloves*. When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied:
    • Dealing 25% more damage
    • Binding the target
    • Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack)
    • Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target

.tag:weapons
<:noxscythe:513190159341322240> **T90 Weapons**
    
⬥ Note: In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use. However, one should be using both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type. 

.
**__Melee__**

    • Costs 50% adrenaline

⬥ Priority: `High`

<:masterworkspearofannihilation:694566917456789554> **Masterwork Spear of Annihilation**
⬥ Passive Effect: Increases duration of melee bleed abilities by 50%.
    • Only affects Dismember, Slaughter, and Blood Tendrils. *Damage over time from the Greater Barge effect is not extended by this weapon.*

    • Attacks your target five times, dealing 20-100% ability damage each attack
        • Ignores Telos' damage reduction while channeling the Insta-Kill on P5, but useless otherwise.
⬥ Priority: `Low if 4taa, Medium otherwise`
    • Note: Should prioritize Praesul wand and orb if you 4taa - most abilities are cast dual-wield, and the staff should mainly only be used for auto attacks.

⬥ Special Attack: *Crystal Rain*
    • Costs 30% adrenaline
    • 5 arrows are launched, the first landing a tick before the rest. The first will always have an opportunity to hit, the rest depending on if they land on game tiles the target occupies. If the first splashes, the rest will splash as well.
        • 30 second cooldown (not incurred if the first arrow splashes).
    • The damage range of the Spec is based a couple factors, refer to the wiki for specifics: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_godbow#Special_attack>

⬥ T80 stats
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • +12.5% damage boost against ranged enemies
    • +10% hit chance boost against ranged enemies
⬥ Note: When assault is bled with the terrasaur maul and the player switches to a weapon of a higher tier such as T92, the passive effect is applied on top of T92 stats rather than the terrasaur maul's T80 stats for the assault hits.
⬥ BiS 2h melee weapon where applicable
    • Commonly used at Sanctum Guardian, Masuta, Seiryu (black crystals), Taraket, Ambassador, Araxxor

    • Lowers the target's defence by 5% of the previous level and applies a debuff that increases the target's affinity values by 2.
⬥ Use cases are in pretty much all high end pvm encounters where hit chance is not 100%. The special attack is also a fairly strong threshold ability alternative.
    • Note: When using the Guthix Staff special you will lose Aftershock stacks unless you 1 tick your special attack. This should be done regardless, and if possible an auto attack should lead into the special attack.
⬥ Priority: `High if you use magic`
