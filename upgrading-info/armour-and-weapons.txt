**__General Armour Introduction__**
⬥ There are two ✌ types 🅱 of 🤤 armour in 👏🍑 Runescape.
    • Power 🔥🔋 Armour. Has 😱🏼 slightly less 👎 defence but 👩🍑 extra 🗣🗣 damage
    • Tank Armour. Has 👉 extra 😜😜 health 💉 and 😏 defence stats
⬥ Due 👅👅 to ⚖➡ how 😦😡 combat works in 💘 Runescape, you 😖 **ALMOST ALWAYS** want 👏 Power 💪🔋 Armour, even 😒 if ❓ it 💁💯 means 🕖👉 you have less defence. Any 💦 exceptions below 😫 will 🎤😘 be noted specifically 🔵🔵 as 😴 **TANK ARMOUR** and will explain why. 👩😡

**__T80 Armour__** <:torvabody:643166871285137458>
⬥ The 👘 standard armour for 🎁🎁 all ♀✊ PvMing
*Note: Masterwork, Sirenic, and Superior Zuriels are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets.*
⬥ Priority: ⬆⬆ `Medium`

.
**__T88 Armour__** <:SuperiorZurielstop:556586037216804864>
⬥ Superior 👃 Ancient Warrior's equipment
⬥ Slightly worse 🤢🤢 defensive bonuses and 👥 dps than 🏽 T90 armour but potentially cheaper.
⬥ Priority: ⬆ `High ⏫ for 👥 Superior Zuriels, low ⬇ for 😣 others`

.
**__T90 Armour__** <:masterworkbody:643847056527458324>
⬥ Better 😎🐍 defensive bonuses, as well ⛲ as 🍑 marginal dps increase 💳 over 😂👉 T80 armour.
⬥ Priority: ⬆ `High 📓 for 🔜 Masterwork and Sirenic, low for 🍆🍆 Tectonic`

.
**__T92 Armour__** <:tmwbody:536966366272552960>
⬥ The best 🏆💆 armour. Relatively small ⏬😂 defence and 👏👨 dps boost vs T90 armour.
⬥ Trimmed masterwork armour's set 😠😠 effect 🐆 and lower 🙅🅱 upkeep cost 🤤 is 😂 what 😟 sets it 😰 apart 😭💕 compared to ➡ the other 👪🎴 T92 armour sets. Elite 👏 sirenic and 👏👏 tectonic do 🤞👌 not ❌🍆 have 🈶🈶 set effects at 🕛 this time. 👌
    • When 😩 wearing 👙 3 or 💀💰 more pieces 💯 of trimmed masterwork, you 🤗🤓 will gain 🏋 10% 🅾 damage offset per 👼👼 piece, 🍗 which ❓ will 👏👏 be applied as damage ☠ over time.
    • Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of 🤔👬 Vengeance 📿 recoil, and 😇 can 💦 negatively impact Reprisal at ❗ bosses like Vorago. As both 🌊 determine their 🍆 damage ☄☄ from Lifepoints lost, 🤔😏 the 👉⭐ damage delaying effect 📣📣 can cause 🎗 them 😬 to 🍆 be ❌ less effective.
⬥ Elite sirenic is 😮💩 slightly more 💯 expensive 💵 to 💯 upkeep than 🙅 normal 🖖🖖 sirenic while 🕗💯 elite 🏻👏 tectonic is cheaper to 😯👉 use 🖐👏 overall than 💰 tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches.
⬥ All 🎁 three 💁 sets do 👏 not degrade in 👏 Elite Dungeons.
⬥ Priority: ⬆⬆ `Low` 📉

⬥ Generally only 👏🕦 used 🚟👨 in 👇 situations where 😠 the 👏👏 cooldown reset is 👉👌 useful, or 💁 tanking damage ☄ has higher importance ❗ than the 🤓 damage ☄ you ☝💬 deal.
    • Most 🦊🥇 common 🐩 situation 🤠 is bringing boots, gloves and ⏰🎅 helmet for 👷 reset chances 🎲🎲 whilst 🎩🎩 still using 🤳🤳 Power 💕⚡ Armour top and legs. 👢
