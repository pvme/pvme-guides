**__General Armour Introduction__**
⬥ There are two types of armour in Runescape.
    • Power Armour. Has slightly less defence but extra damage
    • Tank Armour. Has extra health and defence stats
⬥ Due to how combat works in Runescape, you **ALMOST ALWAYS** want Power Armour, even if it means you have less defence. Any exceptions below will be noted specifically as **TANK ARMOUR** and will explain why.

**__T80 Armour__** <:torvabody:643166871285137458>
⬥ The standard armour for all PvMing
*Note: Masterwork, Superior Morrigan's, and Superior Zuriel's are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets.*
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.
**__T88 Armour__** <:SuperiorZurielstop:556586037216804864>
⬥ Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment
⬥ Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper.
⬥ Priority: `High for Superior Zuriel's and Morrigan's, low for others`

**__T90 Armour__** <:masterworkbody:643847056527458324>
⬥ Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.
⬥ Priority: `High for Masterwork, medium for Sirenic, low for Tectonic`

.
**__T92 Armour__** <:tmwbody:536966366272552960>
⬥ The best armour. Relatively small defence and dps boost vs T90 armour.
⬥ Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time.
    • When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece, which will be applied as damage over time.
    • Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.
⬥ Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches.
⬥ All three sets do not degrade in Elite Dungeons.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

**__Achto__** <:achtoprimevaltop:641344704939819028>
⬥ T90 **tank armour** that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn).
⬥ Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level.
⬥ Generally only used in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal.
    • Most common situation is bringing boots, gloves and helmet for reset chances whilst still using Power Armour top and legs.
    • This way you do not need perk your Tank Armour as well as your Power Armour.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Cinderbane Gloves__** <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>
⬥ BiS gloves for poisonable targets
⬥ Increases the damage poison hits would deal, as well as being able to refresh and proc damage itself.
⬥ Priority: `High if you can use them, Low otherwise`

.
**__Nightmare Gauntlets__** <:NMG:513190159441723392>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • A 25% increased hitchance when using Snipe.
    • Allows you to move whilst using Snipe.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Gloves of Passage__** <:glovespassage:643166351585706060>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • While worn, when the Havoc or Smash abilities are used, your next non-bleed ability deals 10% increased damage, and bleeds on the target deal 20% more damage for the next 10 seconds.
    • The latter effect buffs all melee bleeds and most ranged bleeds, but does not affect Corruption Shot, Corruption Blast or Combust.
⬥ Priority: `High if target is not poisonable, medium otherwise`

**Kerapac's Wrist Wraps__** <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • Whilst worn, for six seconds after using the Dragon Breath ability, the Combust ability will deal 25% more damage, and deal it instantly.
    • This effect causes all of the hits from Combust to be dealt in one large hit on the same tick, rather than many smaller hits over time.
⬥ Priority: `High if not poisonable, medium otherwise`

.
**__Deathtouch Bracelet__** <:DTB:513190159429271562>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker.
    • Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

**__Dominion Tower Gloves__** <:spellcaster:643214402169864213>
⬥ Of these gloves, the only ones that have any niche use in PvM are *Spellcaster Gloves*. When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied:
    • Dealing 25% more damage
    • Binding the target
    • Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack)
    • Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target
⬥ Priority: `Very Low`

.
**__Blast Diffusion Boots__** <:detoboots:602581956072439828>
⬥ Halves the charge time of the Detonate ability.
⬥ Generally used as another main threshold for magic. Usually a 3-tick Detonate for 80% charged Detonate (4-tick Detonate is usually only used for its 5x5 AoE)
⬥ Priority: `High`

**__Fleeting Boots__** <:fleetingboots:789813993480388640>
⬥ Allows movement during Rapid Fire.
⬥ Increases Rapid fire's hit chance by 10%.
⬥ Losing line of sight with target prevents movement until rapid fire ends (bug).
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.
**__TokHaar Capes__** <:KilnMelee:602582045553590274>
⬥ BiS cape stats
*Note: Inferior to strength cape and ranged cape until max cape perk slots are unlocked.*
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
> **__Weapons__**
.tag:weapons
**__General Weapons Introduction__**
⬥ In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps.
⬥ Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use.
⬥ For the best damage output, one should switch between both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type.

.

**__Godswords__** <:armagodsword:860891314379554846>
⬥ T75 2h weapons, Tradable.
⬥ 4 different choices: Armadyl, Bandos, Zamorak and Saradomin.
⬥ Each Godsword can have its effect set as either a passive or a special, although they're only worth using in passive mode.
    • Armadyl can raise your combat stats slightly. Not that useful.
    • Bandos can lower the targets defence.
    • Saradomin can restore you Hitpoints and Prayer points.
    • Zamorak can freeze (snare) a target in place for 10 seconds. Not that useful outside of edge cases.
⬥ If you can afford it, Armadyl Godswords can be dissasembled for Armadyl components which are useful for end-game perks.
⬥ Priority: `High if you cannot use the Crystal Halberd and/or need Armadyl components`

**__Saradomin Sword__**
⬥ T75 2h weapons, Tradable.
⬥ Very cheap.

    • Costs 100% adrenaline

    • A channelled ability that lasts 5 ticks, dealing one hit of 18-90% ability damage per tick for a total of 90-450% ability damage.
    • This special attack benefits from the increased critical hit chance provided by the Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>.
    • Special is mostly useless due to high adrenaline cost and lower damage per tick than the Guthix Staff's special attack.
⬥ Uncommonly used as a weapon due to high cost.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Blade of Avaryss) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components.
    • Off-hand ripper claw can be a useful alternative.
⬥ Components are useful for making a Lunging switch later on.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you want components for a Lunging switch later on. Low otherwise`

**__Ripper Claws__** <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444>
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ Increased damage as the targets health gets lower.
    • The off-hand is sometimes used at the end of long bosses, where the boost is more potent.
    • This is not a common strategy, but it does see use at times.
⬥ Priority: `High if paired with the Blade of Nymora`

**__Tetsu Katana + Tetsu Wakizashi__** <:elitetetsumh:581180369580326923> <:elitetetsuoh:581180369924128788>
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward.
⬥ Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports.
⬥ Can be upgraded to T88 later.

⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ Set effect: Destroy and Hurricane no longer share a cooldown.

⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Orb of the Cywir Elders) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components.
    • Seasinger Makigai is a great T85 off-hand, if you have the Ports progress.
    • Virtus Book or an Attuned Crystal Orb are T80 options.
⬥ Components are useful for making a Planted Feet switch later on.
⬥ T90 accuracy makes this a good Planted Feet switch later on, since you only switch to it for your ultimate then straight back.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for a Planted Feet switch later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later`

⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Unlike the Wand of the Cywir Elders, you don't have many options here, it's a Glaive or an Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow.
⬥ Components can be useful for making a Caroming gizmo later on, but is expensive.
⬥ The mainhand is a very good Planted Feet switch later, due to T90 accuracy.
⬥ Shadow Glaives have a hidden 'feature' where the off-hands damage is slightly lower if the mainhand is not a Shadow Glaive.
    • Due to this, an off-hand Shadow Glaive is a sub-optimal off-hand switch for flanking etc.
    • Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow is the better choice later on, as a result.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for Caroming later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later`

⬥ T87 2h weapon, tradable.
⬥ Special Attack: __Devour__
    • Costs 100% adrenaline
    • For 10 seconds, all healing on the target will be 50% effective.
    • In PvP this effect works on *almost everything* except heal over time components of food (like Great Gunkan) and Immortality.
    • In PvM this effect works on a few non-quest monsters such as Nex during blood phase.
    • Due to the adrenaline cost and the damage you could deal otherwise, the special is functionally useless for PvM.

    • Restores 5% (normal) or 6.66% (superior) of all Melee damage dealt
    • Capped at 200 lifepoints healed per hit
⬥ Priority: `High for Vampyrism, medium for the others`

.
**__God Books__** <:SaraBook:574290439482638346>
⬥ These books come with various effects when active, as well as offering style bonuses as a pocket slot item.
⬥ Generally the only ones used are the Scripture of Wen for stationary targets and the Scripture of Jas for moving ones, except at Nex where the Armadyl book is preferred due to her soft hitcap. Erethdor's Grimoire usually outclasses Scriptures, but has a higher upkeep cost. The others are also usually outclassed by scrims for mage/range.
⬥ Godbooks have a 5% chance to proc per hit (Scriptures are an exception).
⬥ Godbooks have a 15s cooldown between procs. This cooldown is also incurred when the book is initially activated.
⬥ Bleed abilities (e.g., Combust) do not proc god books.
⬥ **Armadyl's Book of Law** <:armabook:513190159051915264>
    • When it activates, a tornado spins at the target's location dealing 4 hits of damage in 4 ticks, dealing 30-50%, 30-50%, 60-100%, and 60-100% damage for a total of 180-300% damage (PvP: 10-30%, 10-30%, 20-60%, 20-60%; total 60-180%). If the target moves from the tornado, the damage is halted.
⬥ **Bandos's Book of War** <:BandosBook:574290439473987628>
    • When it activates, a shockwave hits the target, dealing 90-150% damage (PvP: 30-90%), reducing the target's Defence level by 5% + 5 and increasing its affinity values by 3 for 12 seconds.
⬥ **Ancient Book** <:ZarosBook:574290439461404682>
    • When it activates, icicles hit and surround the target, dealing 120-200% damage (PvP: 40-120%) and binding the target for 4 seconds.
⬥ **Zamorak's Book of Chaos** <:ZamBook:574290439461404672>
    • Has a 5% chance per hit to activate. When it activates, a dark explosion hits the target and the surrounding targets in a 3x3 area for 150-250% damage (split over all targets) (PvP: 50-150%).
.
⬥ **Saradomins's Book of Wisdom** <:SaraBook:574290439482638346>
    • When it activates, a lightning strike hits the target for 165-275% damage (55-165% in PvP).
⬥ **Guthix's Book of Balance** <:GuthixBook:574290439356809216>
    • When it activates, the sword of edicts falls on the target, then burns and explodes. This deals an initial hit of 90-150%, 3 hits of 7.5-12.5%, and finally a hit of 37.5-62.5% (with the final hit being split in a 3x3 area, if there are multiple targets nearby), for a total of 150-250%. (PvP: initially 30-90%, 3 hits of 2.5-7.5%, and 12.5-37.5 AoE; total 50-150%).
⬥ **Scripture of Jas** <:jasgodbook:869284342839513108>
    • Has a 7.5% chance to activate per hit, and it has a 15 second cooldown once activated before it can activate again. When it activates it creates a time rift, and for 10 seconds all damage from the player's abilities while the time rift is active gets stored. Once the rift closes, 20% of the total damage is applied to the player's current target in a single hit.
⬥ **Scripture of Wen** <:wengodbook:883134307902816297>
    • Has a 7.5% chance to activate per hit, and it has a 15 second cooldown once activated before it can activate again. When it activates it summons a 3x3 beam centred on the target's location which lasts for 5 ticks. Each tick, the beam deals up to 2.4-4% ability damage, and any target which is hit five times by this beam takes an additional hit of up to 240-400% ability damage, for a total of 252-420%. These all use a single damage roll, so the initial hits will always be 1% of the final hit.
⬥ Priority: `High for Scriptures of Jas and Wen due to power and extremely low upkeep cost, High for Armadyl book if fighting Nex, Low otherwise`

.
**__Erethdor's Grimoire__** <:grim:568262896375824385>
⬥ When activated, every hit has a 12% chance to become a forced critical hit. This stacks with the Biting perk for a maximum of 20% (20.8% at level 20) chance per ability. It also raises your max hit to 15k for critical hits.
⬥ Priority: `High if optimising damage, low if you care about maximising profit`

.
**__Armour Spikes__** <:armourspike:756235792053174332>
⬥ Can be upgraded to Armour Spikes (alloy) at 99 Smithing
⬥ Upon activation, an armour spike is consumed to deal typless damage equal to the player's current smithing level.
    • Alloy armour spikes have a 10% chance to deal ten times their normal damage.
⬥ To utilize armour spikes:
    • Must have them either equipped or in inventory
    • Must be using melee weapon(s) with melee armour in the torso and leg slots
    • Must be either in melee distance or taking melee damage from a distance (alloy only).

.
**__Dyed Switches__** <:barrowsmalevlegs:580177522831130634>
⬥ This just means you dye a switch so you can have t92/t90 damage when making use of a switch like Flanking or non-mobile Barge.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.

> **__Banking Preset__**
.tag:startup
This is an example of a general PvM preparation preset used for:
⬥ Bonfiring:
    • That's why we have HP boosting gear such as Achto armour <:achtoteralithbody:583428622136901633>, Atrocious Rogue Gloves <:Atrociousroguegloves:556588709634375701>, Superior Reefwalker's Cape <:reefcape:839906296290476033>, and a T90 Shield <:Merciless:583430258829688854>.
    • A viable, cheap substitute for Raids tank armour is Elder Rune +5 armour. The only downside is its un-augmentable.
⬥ Summoning familiars, adjusting to your liking. The preset includes:
    • <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> Blood, <:smokenihil:854475442227642388> Smoke and <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> Shadow Nihil pouches.
    • A Ripper demon pouch <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with its scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203> next to it.

    • <:weppoison:689525476158472288> Weapon Poison+++ in  a 1 dose vial.
    • <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> Elder Overload Salve.
    • <:summrenewal:854475161809190913> A Summoning Renewal in a 1 dose vial.
⬥ Restocking relevant rune pouches. Adjust to your liking.
⬥ Refilling your charge pack.
⬥ Changing spellbooks
⬥ Using Incense sticks. The preset has:
    • <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> Spirit Weed Incense Sticks
    • <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> Kwuarm Incense Sticks
