**__General Armour Introduction__**
⬥ There are two types of armour in Runescape.
    • Power Armour. Has slightly less defence but extra damage
    • Tank Armour. Has extra health and defence stats
⬥ Due to how combat works in Runescape, you **ALMOST ALWAYS** want Power Armour, even if it means you have less defence. Any exceptions below will be noted specifically as **TANK ARMOUR** and will explain why.

.
**__T80 Armour__** <:torvabody:643166871285137458>
⬥ The standard armour for all PvMing
*Note: Masterwork, Sirenic, and Superior Zuriels are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets.*
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.
**__T88 Armour__** <:SuperiorZurielstop:556586037216804864>
⬥ Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment
⬥ Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper.
⬥ Priority: `High for Superior Zuriels, low for others`

.
**__T90 Armour__** <:masterworkbody:643847056527458324>
⬥ Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.
⬥ Priority: `High for Masterwork and Sirenic, low for Tectonic`

.
**__T92 Armour__** <:tmwbody:536966366272552960>
⬥ The best armour. Relatively small defence and dps boost vs T90 armour.
⬥ Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time.
    • When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece, which will be applied as damage over time.
    • Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.
⬥ Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches.
⬥ All three sets do not degrade in Elite Dungeons.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Achto__** <:achtoprimevaltop:641344704939819028>
⬥ T90 **tank armour** that has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when atleast 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn).
⬥ Increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level.
⬥ Generally only used in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal.
    • Most common situation is bringing boots, gloves and helmet for reset chances whilst still using Power Armour top and legs.
    • This way you do not need perk your Tank Armour as well as your Power Armour.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Cinderbanes__** <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>
⬥ BiS gloves for poisonable targets
⬥ Increases the damage poison hits would deal, as well as being able to refresh and proc damage itself
⬥ Priority: `High if you can use them, Low otherwise`

.
**__Nightmare Gauntlets__** <:NMG:513190159441723392>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • A 25% increased hitchance when using Snipe
    • Allows you to move whilst using Snipe
    • A bug that lets you 3-tick cast Snipe when using ability queuing as opposed to 4-tick casting without.
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
**__Deathtouch Bracelet__** <:DTB:513190159429271562>
⬥ Passive Effect:
    • 1/5 chance of reflecting 25-50% damage (~7.5% average reflected) back to the attacker.
    • Unlike the Reflect ability, this does not actually reduce damage received.
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
**__Dominion Tower Gloves__** <:spellcaster:643214402169864213>
⬥ Of these gloves, the only ones that have any niche use in PvM are *Spellcaster Gloves*. When casting a basic ability or an auto attack with these worn, there is a 5% chance of the following effect being applied:
    • Dealing 25% more damage
    • Binding the target
    • Lowering the target's Magic, Attack, Range, and Defense by 7 levels (does not stack)
    • Delayed abilities (e.g. blitz spells, sonic) will instantly hit the target
⬥ Priority: `Very Low`

.
**__Blast Diffusion Boots__** <:detoboots:602581956072439828>
⬥ Halves the charge time of the Detonate ability.
⬥ Generally used as another main threshold for magic. Usually a 3-tick Detonate for 80% charged Detonate (4-tick Detonate is usually only used for its 5x5 AoE)
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
**__Laceration Boots__** <:Laceration:602581988599398400>
⬥ Allows Bladed Dive to be used with only a mainhand or 2h melee weapon
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.

⬥ Priority: `Medium`

.
**__TokHaar Capes__** <:KilnMelee:602582045553590274>
⬥ BiS cape stats
*Note: Inferior to strength cape and ranged cape until max cape perk slots are unlocked.*
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
> **__Weapons__**
.tag:weapons
.
**__General Weapons Introduction__**
⬥ In general dual-wield camp > 2h camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps. 
⬥ Using dual-wield also makes shield, Flanking, and Lunging switches easier and more fluid to use.
⬥ For the best damage output, one should switch between both dual-wield and 2h weapons in order to use abilities that are normally exclusive to either type.

.

**__Godswords__**
⬥ T75 2h weapons, Tradable.
⬥ 4 different choices: Armadyl, Bandos, Zamorak and Saradomin.
⬥ Each Godsword can have its effect set as either a passive or a special, although they're only worth using in passive mode.
    • Armadyl can raise your combat stats slightly. Not that useful.
    • Bandos can lower the targets defence.
    • Saradomin can restore you Hitpoints and Prayer points.
    • Zamorak can freeze (snare) a target in place for 10 seconds. Not that useful outside of edge cases.
⬥ If you can afford it, Armadyl Godswords can be dissasembled for Armadyl components which are useful for end-game perks.
⬥ Priority: `High if you cannot use the Crystal Halberd and/or need Armadyl components`

**__Saradomin Sword__**
⬥ T75 2h weapons, Tradable.
⬥ Very cheap.
⬥ Special Attack: __Saradomin's Lightning__
    • Costs 100% adrenaline
    • Strikes the target twice, once with Melee and once with Magic. Both hits do 35%-175% ability damage.
    • Special is completely useless due to low damage and high adrenaline cost.

.
**__Abyssal Wand + Abyssal Orb__**
⬥ T75 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable.

⬥ Worth disassembling for 'Explosive' components which are useful for end-game perks.
⬥ Special Attack: __Aimed Shot__
    • Costs 50% adrenaline
    • Takes longer to fire than a standard attack or ability
    • Has 75% additional accuracy, hits for 30%-200% ability damage.
    • Special is completely useless due to low damage and high adrenaline cost.
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
**__Sunspear__**
⬥ T77 2h weapon for all combat styles, Untradable quest reward.
⬥ Requires completion of 'River of Blood', which has a long quest chain.
⬥ Very cheap.
⬥ Can be changed freely between Melee, Ranged and Magic, meaning it can train all 3 styles.
⬥ Can also be a budget Planted Feet switch weapon later (Since you can switch it between Ranged and Magic)
⬥ Priority: `High if you aren't many quests away or enjoy questing. The quest chain is long. Low otherwise`

.
**__Bane Weapons__**
⬥ T79 2h, mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable.

    • 3 different attunements available: Abyssal, Dragon, Revenant.

⬥ T80 mainhand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ Requires completion of 'Kindred Spirits'.
⬥ Will need to pair with a lower tier off-hand.

**__Virtus Wand + Virtus Book__**
⬥ T80 mainhand and off-hand weapons, Tradable.
⬥ Easily accessible.
⬥ Can be a useful source of Zaros components.
⬥ You should keep these going forward if you have no Ports progress and are unlikely to do so.
    • Wand: Attuned Crystal Wand and the Wand of the Cywir Elders are your only other available mainhands before T90.
    • Off-hand: Attuned Crystal Orb of the Cywir Elders are your only other available off-hands before T90.
    • Off-hand: Without ports you will use this off-hand all the way to T90.
⬥ Priority: `High`

.
**__Zaryte Bow__** <:zarytebow:791280228377952276>
⬥ T80 2h weapon, Tradable.

⬥ Only recommended if you have a surplus of Dungeoneering tokens.

T85 2h weapon, Tradable.
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage.
⬥ Increased area of effect.
⬥ Better than the Matsuta's Warspear if you keep missing hits.
⬥ Components are useful for end-game perks, but the spear is expensive.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you keep missing hits, lowering your training speed`

**__Blade of Nymora + Blade of Avaryss__** <:nymorablade:643161612819365888> <:avaryssblade:643161612383158296>
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Blade of Avaryss) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components.
    • Off-hand ripper claw can be a useful alternative.
⬥ Components are useful for making a Lunging switch later on.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you want components for a Lunging switch later on. Low otherwise`

**__Ripper Claws__** <:ripperclaw:797895640054759444> 
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ Increased damage as the targets health gets lower.
    • The off-hand is sometimes used at the end of long bosses, where the boost is more potent.
    • This is not a common strategy, but it does see use at times.
⬥ Priority: `High if paired with the Blade of Nymora, or you really want the off-hand as a 'meme' low HP switch weapon`

**__Tetsu Katana + Tetsu Wakizashi__**
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward.
⬥ Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports.
⬥ Can be upgraded to T88 later.
⬥ Since Melee has 3 different T90 dual wields, this will have no use as a flanking/lunging switch at T90.
⬥ Priority: `Very Low unless you want the fashionscape`

.
**__Wand of the Cywir Elders + Orb of the Cywir Elders__** <:cywirwand:643161591571021824> <:cywirorb:643161591210049556>
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Due to off-hand accuracy being (almost completely) useless, the off-hand (Orb of the Cywir Elders) is effectively a T80 weapon, and less useful unless you need lots of components.
    • Seasinger Makigai is a great T85 off-hand, if you have the Ports progress.
    • Virtus Book or an Attuned Crystal Orb are T80 options.
⬥ Components are useful for making a Planted Feet switch later on.
⬥ T90 accuracy makes this a good Planted Feet switch later on, since you only switch to it for your ultimate then straight back.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for a Planted Feet switch later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later`

**__Seasinger Kiba + Seasinger Makigai__**
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward.
⬥ Requires significant progress in Player Owned Ports.
⬥ Can be upgraded to T88 later.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you want to do ports, since these and their upgraded versions are the best options for switches at T90 for Magic`

.
**__Shadow Glaive + Off-hand Shadow Glaive__** <:glaivemh:643161561988595782> <:glaiveoh:643161561707446283>
⬥ T85 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Tradable.
⬥ T90 accuracy, T80 damage
⬥ Unlike the Wand of the Cywir Elders, you don't have many options here, it's a Glaive or an Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow.
⬥ Components can be useful for making a Caroming gizmo later on, but is expensive.
⬥ The mainhand is a very good Planted Feet switch later, due to T90 accuracy.
⬥ Shadow Glaives have a hidden 'feature' where the off-hands damage is slightly lower if the mainhand is not a Shadow Glaive.
    • Due to this, an off-hand Shadow Glaive is a sub-optimal off-hand switch for flanking etc.
    • Off-hand Chaotic Crossbow is the better choice later on, as a result.
⬥ Priority: `Very High if you are missing a lot, if you want components for Caroming later on, and if you want a switch for Planted Feet later`

**__Wyvern Crossbow__** <:WyvernCrossbow:580177522587729940>
⬥ T85 2h weapon, Tradable.
⬥ Applies its own form of poison.

    • Stacks are gained whenever you hit a target. (bleed hits count)
    • Stacks are reset after 30 seconds, when you use the special again, when you miss or when you switch main hand weapons.
    • Not useful due to limitations and 'wind-up' time.
⬥ Priority: `Low. The AoE of a Matsuta's Warspear or a Dragonrider Lance will outweigh this`

.
**__Decimation__** <:decimation:643848618477879328>
⬥ T87 2h weapon, tradable.
⬥ Does not need ammo.
⬥ Special Attack: __Locate__
    • Costs 50% adrenaline
    • For 10 seconds, all your single-target abilities will hit all targets in a 3x3 area centered on your main target.
    • The effect refreshes to 10 seconds if you spec again, and will end if you switch weapons.
    • Very effective for pushing Shattered Worlds.
⬥ Priority: `High. You don' get many options at this level for Ranging, this is a good one to get you to T90`

.

⬥ T87 2h weapon, tradable.
⬥ Special Attack: __Devour__
    • Costs 100% adrenaline

    • In PvP this effect works on *almost everything* except heal over time components of food (like Great Gunkan) and Immortality.
    • In PvM this effect works on a few non-quest monsters such as Nex during blood phase.
    • Due to the adrenaline cost and the damage you could deal otherwise, the special is functionally useless for PvM.
⬥ Priority: `High if you can't get Ports weapons for Magic`

⬥ T88 mainhand and off-hand weapon, Untradable Player Owned Ports reward.

    • Additionally costs 0.1% maximum charge per special
    • Hits the target with increased accuracy for 50%-300% ability damage.
    • Special has odd damage calculation, meaning it will more often hit in the middle of that range.
