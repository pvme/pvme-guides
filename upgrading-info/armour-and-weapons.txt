<:torvabody:643166871285137458> **T80 Armour**
⬥ The standard armour for all PvMing
      • Note: Should just opt for Masterwork over Torva due to costs
⬥ Priority: `High`
_ _
.
<:masterworkbody:643847056527458324> **T90 Armour**
⬥ Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase to t80 armor
⬥ Priority: `High for Masterwork, Medium for others`
_ _
.
<:tmwbody:536966366272552960> **T92 Armour**
⬥ The best armor. Relatively small defense and dps boost vs t90 armor
      • Note: Due to costs none are worth using outside of Elite Dungeons except for Trimmed Masterwork
      • Note: TMW effect and low cost is what makes it worthwhile
        - When wearing 3+ pieces you will gain x*10% damage soak that will be applied as a DoT where x is number of pieces worn. If 3 pieces it is 30%
        - Note: Reduces damage of veng recoil, and can negatively impact reprisals at bosses like Vorago, because it reduces the damage taken in and used by reprisal for things such as TS explosion
⬥ Priority: `Low`
_ _
.
<:achtoprimevaltop:641344704939819028> **Achto**

⬥ It also increases damage deal whilst wearing a shield/shieldbow at 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level
⬥ Generally only used in like 1% of situations where you'd want the defensive resets or need to tank long term
⬥ Priority: `Low`
