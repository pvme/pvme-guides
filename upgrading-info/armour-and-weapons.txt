**__General Armour Introduction__**
⬥ There are two types of armour in Runescape.
    • Power Armour
        - Has slightly less defence but extra damage
    • Tank Armour
        - Has extra health and defence stats but no extra damage
⬥ Due to how combat works in Runescape, you **ALMOST ALWAYS** want Power Armour, even if it means you have less defence. Any exceptions below will be noted specifically as **TANK ARMOUR** and will explain why.

.
**__T80 Armour__** <:torvabody:643166871285137458>
⬥ The standard armour for all PvMing
*Note: Masterwork, Sirenic and Superior Zuriel's are recommended over their T80 counterparts due to the high cost of Nex armour sets.*
⬥ Priority: `Medium`

**__T88 Armour__** <:SuperiorZurielstop:556586037216804864>
⬥ Superior Ancient Warrior's equipment
⬥ Slightly worse defensive bonuses and dps than T90 armour but potentially cheaper.
⬥ Priority: `High for Superior Zuriel's, Medium for Morrigan's, low for others`

**__T90 Armour__** <:masterworkbody:643847056527458324>
⬥ Better defensive bonuses, as well as marginal dps increase over T80 armour.
⬥ Priority: `High for Masterwork and Sirenic, low for Tectonic`

**__T92 Armour__** <:tmwbody:536966366272552960>
⬥ The best armour. Relatively small defence and dps boost vs T90 armour.
⬥ Trimmed masterwork armour's set effect and lower upkeep cost is what sets it apart compared to the other T92 armour sets. Elite sirenic and tectonic do not have set effects at this time.
    • When wearing 3 or more pieces of trimmed masterwork, you will gain 10% damage offset per piece, which will be applied as damage over time.
    • Trimmed masterwork reduces damage of Vengeance recoil, and can negatively impact Reprisal at bosses like Vorago. As both determine their damage from Lifepoints lost, the damage delaying effect can cause them to be less effective.
⬥ Elite sirenic is slightly more expensive to upkeep than normal sirenic while elite tectonic is cheaper to use overall than tectonic due to needing specific repair pouches.
⬥ All three sets do not degrade in Elite Dungeons.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Achto__** <:achtoprimevaltop:641344704939819028>
⬥ T90 **tank armour**, Untradable raids Reward
⬥ Passive when equipped:
    • Has a chance to reset all defensive cooldowns when at least 3 pieces are worn (2% chance per piece worn).
    • Each piece worn increases damage dealt while wearing a shield/shieldbow by 10% of the equivalent offhand weapon damage based on the shield's level.
        - If a defender is worn, the bonus is half of that.
⬥ Generally only used in situations where the cooldown reset is useful, or tanking damage has higher importance than the damage you deal.
    • Most common situation is bringing boots, gloves and helmet for reset chances whilst still using Power Armour top and legs.
    • This way you do not need perk your Tank Armour as well as your Power Armour.
⬥ Priority: `Low`

.
**__Cryptbloom armour__** <:cryptbloombody:892819107253194762>
⬥ T90 **tank armour**, Tradeable
⬥ Passive when equipped:
    • With at least 2 pieces equiped, incoming melee damage is reduced by 8% and incoming magic damage is reduced by 12%.
    • With at least 3 pieces equiped, these bonuses are increased by a further 4% for melee and 6% for magic, and a further 4% for melee and 6% for magic if you are casting an earth spell.
        - This puts the maximum damage reduction from this effect at 16% for melee and 24% for magic.
    • With at least 4 pieces equiped, each successful hit received has a 6% chance of applying a debuff to the boss, causing it to take 10% more damage when attacked from behind.
    • With at least 5 pieces equiped, falling below 20% of your maximum HP will trigger a Fungal Shield that absorbs a certain amount of HP before you continue taking damage, scaling based on your defence level and armour rating. This effect has a 2 minute cooldown before it can activate again.
        - The fungal shield will typically have a durability of around 3k lifepoints.
⬥ Commonly used for the 3 piece effect when learning bosses where endurance is important and you are taking a lot of incoming magic and melee damage.
⬥ Most notable places it can be used are Telos, TzKal-Zuk and Hard Mode Kerapac.
⬥ The 4 piece effect can make it better than power armour when basing some bosses, such as Yakamaru, in large groups.
⬥ Priority: `TBD`

> **__Weapons__**
.tag:weapons
**__General Weapons Introduction__**
⬥ In general dual-wield camp > 2H camp at bosses due to marginally better single target dps.

    • Bandos can lower the targets defence.
    • Saradomin can restore you Hitpoints and Prayer points.
    • Zamorak can freeze (snare) a target in place for 10 seconds. Not that useful outside of edge cases.

    • This special attack does not benefit from the accuracy increased shared by most other special attacks.
    • The duration is extended by the Masterwork Spear of Annihilation's effect, for a maximum of 14 hits, and consequently putting this weapon in an Essence of Finality and casting the special with the Spear is the optimal way to use the special attack.

**__Max/Comp Cape Perks__**

⬥ **Defence** <:Defence:689509250979987525>
    • Acts as a sign of life
    • Priority: `High`

⬥ **Strength** <:Strength:689509250879324165>
    • Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> hits 3 more times.

    • Useful for healing at bank as well as regen throughout fights, though the effect is rather minimal
    • Scales with maximum HP

    • Ammo proc chance is increased by 20% of the base chance.
    • Priority: `High if ranging, otherwise Low`

⬥ **Attack/Invention** <:Attack:689509250472476758> / <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • The impact these have on upkeep costs is relatively minimal, and these capes are mostly just filler.
    • The combatant's cape cannot have the Invention cape perk on it.
    • Priority: `Low`

.
> **__Miscellaneous__**
.tag:misc
**__Scrimshaws__** <:Cruelty:513190159546712074>

⬥ Priority: `High for Vampyrism, medium for the others`

.
**__God Books__** <:SaraBook:574290439482638346>
⬥ These books come with various effects when active, as well as offering style bonuses as a pocket slot item.
⬥ Generally the only ones used are the Scripture of Wen for stationary targets and the Scripture of Jas for moving ones, except at Nex where the Armadyl book is preferred due to her soft hitcap. Erethdor's Grimoire usually outclasses Scriptures, but has a higher upkeep cost. The others are also usually outclassed by scrims for mage/range.
⬥ Godbooks have a 6.6% chance to proc per hit dealt; in Legacy Mode, this chance is increased to 33.3%.
⬥ Godbooks have a 15s cooldown between procs, counting from the initial proc (not when an ongoing effect expires). This cooldown is also incurred when the book is initially activated, making switching between a god book and another item entirely impractical.
⬥ Bleed / Burn abilities (e.g., Combust) do not proc god books.
    • Though Bleed abilities with a non-bleed hit (e.g., Deadshot) can proc it on the non-bleed hit
⬥ DoT abilities may or may not proc god books:
    • Does proc: Barge Bleeds
    • Does not proc: Corruption Blast/Shot
.
⬥ **Armadyl's Book of Law** <:armabook:513190159051915264>
    • When it activates, a tornado spins at the target's location dealing 4 hits of damage in 4 ticks, dealing 30-50%, 30-50%, 60-100%, and 60-100% damage for a total of 180-300% damage (PvP: 10-30%, 10-30%, 20-60%, 20-60%; total 60-180%). If the target moves from the tornado, the damage is halted.
⬥ **Bandos's Book of War** <:BandosBook:574290439473987628>
    • When it activates, a shockwave hits the target, dealing 90-150% damage (PvP: 30-90%), reducing the target's Defence level by 5% + 5 and increasing its affinity values by 3 for 12 seconds.
⬥ **Ancient Book** <:ZarosBook:574290439461404682>
    • When it activates, icicles hit and surround the target, dealing 120-200% damage (PvP: 40-120%) and binding the target for 4 seconds.
⬥ **Zamorak's Book of Chaos** <:ZamBook:574290439461404672>
    • Has a 5% chance per hit to activate. When it activates, a dark explosion hits the target and the surrounding targets in a 3x3 area for 150-250% damage (split over all targets) (PvP: 50-150%).
.
⬥ **Saradomins's Book of Wisdom** <:SaraBook:574290439482638346>
    • When it activates, a lightning strike hits the target for 165-275% damage (55-165% in PvP).
⬥ **Guthix's Book of Balance** <:GuthixBook:574290439356809216>
    • When it activates, the sword of edicts falls on the target, then burns and explodes. This deals an initial hit of 90-150%, 3 hits of 7.5-12.5%, and finally a hit of 37.5-62.5% (with the final hit being split in a 3x3 area, if there are multiple targets nearby), for a total of 150-250%. (PvP: initially 30-90%, 3 hits of 2.5-7.5%, and 12.5-37.5 AoE; total 50-150%).
⬥ **Scripture of Jas** <:jasgodbook:869284342839513108>
    • When it activates it creates a time rift, and for 10 seconds all damage from the player's abilities while the time rift is active gets stored. Once the rift closes, 20% of the total damage is applied to the player's current target (which does not necessarily need to be the same target as the initial proc) in a single hit.
.
⬥ **Scripture of Wen** <:wengodbook:883134307902816297>
    • When it activates it summons a 3x3 beam centred on the target's location which lasts for 5 ticks. Each tick, the beam deals up to 2.4-4% ability damage, and any target which is hit five times by this beam takes an additional hit of up to 240-400% ability damage, for a total of 252-420%. These all use a single damage roll, so the initial hits will always be 1% of the final hit.
⬥ **Scripture of Ful** <:scriptureofful:902209626412560395>
    • When it activates, you gain an additive 20% boost to damage dealt (does not affect bleeds) and a 10% increase to damage received. This damage boost stacks additively with Berserk, effectively becoming a 10% boost within it.
⬥ Priority: `High for Scripture of Wen due to power and extremely low upkeep cost, High for Armadyl book if fighting Nex, Medium for Jas if on a budget, Low otherwise. TBD for Scripture of Ful`

.
**__Erethdor's Grimoire__** <:grim:568262896375824385>
⬥ When activated, every hit has a 12% chance to become a forced critical hit. This stacks with the Biting perk for a maximum of 20% (20.8% at level 20) chance per ability. It also raises your max hit to 15k for critical hits.
⬥ Priority: `High if optimising damage, low if you care about maximising profit`

.
**__Armour Spikes__** <:armourspike:756235792053174332>
⬥ Can be upgraded to Armour Spikes (alloy) at 99 Smithing
⬥ Upon activation, an armour spike is consumed to deal typless damage equal to the player's current smithing level.

    • Must have them either equipped or in inventory

⬥ Priority: `High for main pouch, Medium for secondary pouches`

**__Pernix's Quiver__** <:pernixsquiver:902209626450296892>
⬥ Allows you to store two types of ranged ammunition.
    • This can be any combination of arrows and bolts. If one is arrows and one is bolts, the quiver will switch between the two automatically when appropriate weapons are equipped.
    • Equipping the quiver unlocks abilities that can be placed on your action bar to switch ammunition types. Alternatively, the quiver itself can be put on your action bar to left click cycle ammunition while equipped.

> **__Banking Preset__**
.tag:startup
This is an example of a general PvM preparation preset used for:
⬥ Bonfiring:
    • Bonfires boost the maximum life points cap by up to 5% of the total life points originating from the Constitution level and worn equipment. That's why we have HP boosting gear such as Achto armour <:achtoteralithbody:583428622136901633>, Atrocious Rogue Gloves <:Atrociousroguegloves:556588709634375701>, Superior Reefwalker's Cape <:reefcape:839906296290476033>, and a T90 Shield <:Merciless:583430258829688854>.
    • A viable, cheap substitute for Raids tank armour is Elder Rune +5 armour. The only downside is its un-augmentable.
    • An Ogre Flask (thermal) <:thermalflask:689530593796423724> can also be used - it stacks additively with the bonfire effect.
⬥ Summoning familiars, adjusting to your liking. The preset includes:
    • A Ripper demon pouch <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with its scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203> next to it.
⬥ Drinking potions previous to the fight. The preset includes:
    • <:weppoison:689525476158472288> Weapon Poison+++ in  a 1 dose vial.
    • <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> Elder Overload Salve.
⬥ Restocking relevant rune pouches. Adjust to your liking.
⬥ Recharging your preferred pocket slot book.
⬥ Refilling your charge pack.
⬥ Changing spellbooks
⬥ Using Incense sticks. The preset has:
    • <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> Spirit Weed Incense Sticks
    • <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> Kwuarm Incense Sticks
    • <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368> Lantadyme Incense Sticks
