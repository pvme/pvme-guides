⬥ Costs <:MarksofWar:704701746869567551> 25,000 Marks of War
⬥ BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following buffs:
      • These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/range damage and accuracy respectively; this does not stack with damage boosting ultimates
      • The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With a supreme overload, this results in a level of 128
      • You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage. Hard typeless is unaffected
      • In addition to this your defence level is reduced by 15%
⬥ They should be used in any bossing encounter where you do not have 100% accuracy; and optionally any time you wish to deal more damage with a specific style  
⬥ Priority: `High`
      • These should be the first auras you unlock, start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras

⬥ Costs <:loyaltypoint:704657054987452447> 107,000 Loyalty Points per aura (cumulative cost for supreme variant)
⬥ Increase melee/magic/range accuracy by 3%/5%/7%/10% per rank respectively. They last 1 hour by default and can be extended to 2 hours
⬥ Reasonable option if zerk auras are on cooldown and you do not have 100% accuracy
⬥ Priority: `Low` Only get these after you have all berserk auras, either way these will likely see little use

⬥ Mahjarrat costs either <:Reaperpoints:704657943194501140> 1000 Reaper Points or <:Bond:513213538463121408> 3 Bonds
⬥ Mahjarrat provides a 5% damage boost and Dark magic deals damage over time to your target
⬥ These are used in cases where you hybrid and already have 100% accuracy

<:inspiration:643505652634746881> <:invig:643505652865695767> **Inspiration & Invigorate Aura**
⬥ Inspiration costs <:loyaltypoint:704657054987452447> 23,000 Loyalty Points
⬥ Invigorate costs <:loyaltypoint:704657054987452447> 115,000 Loyalty Points (cumulative cost for supreme variant)
⬥ Inspiration causes successful attacks to give an extra 0.5% adrenaline. Invigorate saves 2.5%/5%/7.5%/10% adrenaline after an ultimate; this effect stacks with a ring of vigour
⬥ These auras can be used as a last resort option for bosses you already have 100% accuaracy. Alternatively they can be used for elite dungeons or slayer, but are still inferior to berserk auras
⬥ Priority: `Medium/Low`

<:penance:643505653062565907> <:vamp:643505653079343144> **Penance & Vampyrism Aura**

<:HoodedMax:580177869284835328> **Max Cape Perks**
⬥ The max and comp capes can fit 3 perks, and the combatants cape can fit two. Generally, the following perks should be prioritized:
      • <:Defence:689509250979987525> This is a must, as it acts as a sign of life and frees up your pocket slot for much more useful items. It also saves you an inventory slot as you do not need portent of life.
      • <:Strength:689509250879324165> Dismember hits 3 more times (from 5 to 8), effectively increasing its damage by 60%. Very powerful with Lunging perk. Only useful if meleeing, can skip if you do not melee.
      • <:Constitution:689509250887712902> Useful for healing at bank as well as regen throughout fights, though the effect is rather minimal. Scales with maximum HP.
      • <:Ranged:689504724403486920> Ammo proc chance is increased by 20%. For example, the base chance of ruby bakriminel (e) proccing is 5%. This cape boosts it to 6% (20% of 5% is +1%). Only useful if ranging, can skip if you do not range.
	  • <:Attack:689509250472476758>/<:Invention:689509250946695292> The impact these have on upkeep costs is relatively minimal, and these capes are mostly just filler; the combatants cape cannot have invention on it.
