⬥ Costs <:MarksofWar:704701746869567551> 25,000 Marks of War
⬥ BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following effects:
    • These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/ranged damage and accuracy.
        - This does not stack with damage-boosting ultimates <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:meta:535533811304497183>
    • The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With an elder overload, this results in a level of 130.
    • You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage. Hard typeless is unaffected.
        - In addition to this, your defence level is reduced by 15%.
⬥ They should be used in nearly all bossing encounters, especially if you don't have 100% hitchance.
    • Priority: `High`
    • These should be the first auras you unlock. Start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras.

⬥ Mahjarrat provides a 5% damage boost and Dark Magic deals damage over time to your target.
