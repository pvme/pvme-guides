⬥ Costs <:MarksofWar:704701746869567551> 25,000 Marks of War
⬥ BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following buffs:
⬥ These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/ranged damage and accuracy respectively; this does not stack with damage boosting ultimates
⬥ The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With an elder overload, this results in a level of 130
⬥ You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage. Hard typeless is unaffected
⬥ In addition to this your defence level is reduced by 15%
⬥ They should be used in any bossing encounter where you do not have 100% accuracy; and optionally any time you wish to deal more damage with a specific style  
      • Priority: `High`
      • These should be the first auras you unlock, start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras
