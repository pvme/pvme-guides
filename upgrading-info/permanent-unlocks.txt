⬥ Costs <:MarksofWar:704701746869567551> 25,000 Marks of War
⬥ BIS auras at most places, they last 30 minutes but are extended to 1 hour via vis wax. Provide the following effects:
    • These auras provide an invisible 10% boost to the player's melee/magic/ranged damage and accuracy.
        - This does not stack with damage-boosting ultimates <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:meta:535533811304497183>
    • The respective combat level is also increased by 10%. With an elder overload, this results in a level of 130.
    • You will also receive 15% more melee, magic, ranged and soft typeless damage.
        - Hard typeless is unaffected.
        - In addition to this, your defence level is reduced by 15%.
⬥ They should be used in nearly all bossing encounters, especially if you don't have 100% hitchance.
    • Priority: `High`
    • These should be the first auras you unlock. Start with the combat style you use the most then move on to the remaining two before getting other auras.

⬥ Mahjarrat provides a 5% damage boost and Dark Magic deals damage over time to your target.
⬥ These are used in cases where you hybrid or already have 100% accuracy with zerk auras on cooldown.

⬥ Invigorate costs <:loyaltypoint:704657054987452447> 115,000 Loyalty Points (cumulative cost for supreme variant)
    • Invigorate saves 2.5%/5%/7.5%/10% adrenaline after an ultimate.
        - This effect stacks with a ring of vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792>
⬥ These auras can be used as a last resort option for bosses you already have 100% accuracy. Alternatively they can be used for Elite Dungeons or slayer, but are still inferior to zerk auras.
    • Priority: `Medium/Low`
