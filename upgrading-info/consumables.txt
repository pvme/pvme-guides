> **__Pvm incense stick guide__**
.tag:incense
⬥ Incense sticks are created by combining logs, ashes, and herbs. 
     • Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes.
     • Incense sticks have a potency from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' by right clicking the incense sticks for an upfront cost of 6 sticks for 10 minutes (each additional stick used after this adds 10 minutes to the duration)
     • `In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better.`
     • Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death or practice mode. 
     • You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking.
.

**The relevant incense sticks with pvm benefits are listed as follows:**
⬥ <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> Spirit Weed
     • Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate
     • `Worth using everywhere you use familiar special attacks often`
     
⬥ <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> Kwuarm
     • Each potency level provides +2.5% weapon poison damage
     • `Worth using against poisonable targets`
     
⬥ <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> Irit
     • Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25%
     • `Worth using mostly at Gregorovic since he drains antipoison very quickly, otherwise it is a good option anywhere you get poisoned if you don't have access to other antipoison methods
     `
⬥ <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368> Lantadyme
     • Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. 
     • `Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads. Use at your discretion.`
     
⬥ <:FellstalkSticks:690987265421213746> Fellstalk (For Slayer)
     • Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters
     • `Worth using if hunting specific drops from elite slayer monsters such as Edimmu pet`
     
⬥ <:RanarrSticks:690987265186594857> Ranarr 
     • Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus
     • `Functionally useless`

.
**Note: Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where their benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit. But here is a general list of where you would use certain incense sticks.**

     • Spirit Weed

Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using crossbows it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts (e) for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. *If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta*.

     • Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 
     • 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. 
     • The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. 
     • Ruby bolts have diminishing returns in their proc hit, so it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt when a monster's hp gets low, as ruby bolt procs can      
     • eventually be less than the original hit would have been.
     • Priority: `High`
.

     • Very expensive.
     • Priority: `High`

.tag:miscellaneous
