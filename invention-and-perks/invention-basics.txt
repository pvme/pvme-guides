.tag:unlock
__**Requirements**__
⬥ Unlocking Invention has the following requirements:
    • 80 Smithing
    • 80 Crafting
    • 80 Divination

.
__**Unlocking Invention**__
⬥ First head to the Invention guild located just north of Falador (around the Dwarven mines area).
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Bq1tAou.png
⬥ Next go to talk to the dwarf inside called Doc.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1u8quO8.png
⬥ Doc will walk you through a basic Invention tutorial that shows you how to augment items.

.
> __**The Inventor's Workbench**__
.tag:workbench
__**Using the Workbench**__
⬥ This is where you'll manufacture most of the items Invention gives you access to.
⬥ Each bench has two click options: **discover** and **manufacture**
⬥ You must first **discover** an item before you can **manufacture** it.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VcjjxMr.png

.
__**Discovery Tab**__
⬥ This is the screen you'll see when you open the _Discover_ tab.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/L1xzFwg.png
.
⬥ On the left, there are **blueprints**, corresponding to Invention items.
⬥ A blueprint must be successfully 'completed' before the corresponding item is accessible to you.
⬥ Selecting a blueprint brings up a small minigame:
    • You first select 5 modules (through trial and error) from 10 options to find the ones that work.
    • Then you arrange them into order to successfully unlock items, which gives some <:Invention:689509250946695292> experience.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/R5unsHe.png
⬥ Note:
    • The modules can be placed in *any* order (but correct orders give up to 5x more <:Invention:689509250946695292> experience).
    • The different levels of success are: **Poor < Satisfactory < Good < Excellent < Perfect**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7q46xXN.png
.
⬥ Once you have discovered items, you can manufacture them using the other side of the workbench.

.
__**Manufacturing Tab**__
⬥ The right side of the bench allows you to manufacture invention items.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/V7TT3a2.png
⬥ This includes things like divine charges <:divinecharge:1010485547598356530>, gizmos <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382> <:ancientarmourgizmo:697405383769194516> <:ancienttoolgizmo:697405383513473046>, invention items <:dummy:656844963522281473>, certain augmented items <:sirenicbody:643846948570267648> <:sireniclegs:643846938537623564>, and much more.

.
> __**Components**__
.tag:comps
__**What Are Components**__
⬥ Components are used in the creation of all Invention items and perks.
⬥ You get them primarily from disassembling things.
⬥ There are 4 types of components: **common**, **uncommon**, **rare** and **ancient**.
⬥ You can check what components you have by clicking on the aforementioned icon.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/96igPYd.png
⬥ As you start collecting components, they will be filled into your invention pouch, looking something like this.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/M0Oc0Ey.png

.
__**Obtaining Components**__
***Note**: See __**Disassembling Items for Components**__ to see what to disassemble for components.*
⬥ **Components are primarily obtained by disassembling other items**.
    • Items can be disassembled by dragging them onto the small lightbulb <:Invention:689509250946695292> icon at the bottom of your inventory.
    • The number of components that an item when disassembled depends on the item (and on the item level for augmentable items).
    • Not all items can be disassembled.
⬥ **Components can also be gained from the Scavenging <:scavenging4:1005934140669046824> perk.**
    • Gives uncommon/rare components.
⬥ **Ancient components can be traded on the GE (in packs).**

.
> __**Gizmos and Perks**__
.tag:gizmosperks
Gizmos are the main focus of invention. They allow you to put perks on your weapons, armour and tools which allow for some very useful effects during skilling or PvM.

.
__**Making Gizmos**__
⬥ There are separate gizmos for tools <:ancienttoolgizmo:697405383513473046>, weapons <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382> and armour <:ancientarmourgizmo:697405383769194516> each has to be discovered at the workbench.
⬥ Unlock gizmos by discovering their blueprints at the following levels:
    • Weapon gizmos - level 3 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • Armor gizmos - level 16 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • Tool gizmos - level 22 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
⬥ You can then create at the workbench if you have sufficient resources.

.
__**Adding Perks to Gizmos**__
⬥ Click a gizmo to bring up the following menu:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/lpZ1nXp.png
.
⬥ Click or drag components to fill the slots on the top right. This will fill them with the selected component.
⬥ Depending on the components used and their layout, the possible perk results are shown on the bottom right.
⬥ Click **Create** to create the gizmo.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/H3qQ2F9.png
⬥ **Each gizmo can hold up to 2 perks.**
    • This is why most endgame PvM perks are a combo of two perks - this maximises the number of perks you can have
    • e.g. a single gizmo containing Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931> and Mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> perks

⬥ **Keep in mind:**
    • Not all perks are guaranteed outcomes. Be prepared to try multiple times in some cases.
    • Perks with multiple ranks will be more effective at higher ranks.
        - e.g. Biting 1 gives 2% crit chance, Biting 4 gives +8% crit chance
    • **You should wait to get expensive endgame perks at level 120 Invention.**

.
__**Adding Gizmos to Items**__
⬥ **Gizmos can only be added to augmented items, as follows:**
    • Tools: 2 gizmos each
    • MH / OH weapons: 1 gizmo each
    • Body/leg armors and 2h weapons: 2 gizmos each

⬥ To remove a gizmo from an item, there are a few options:
    • **Gizmo dissolvers** will remove a single gizmo, destroying the perks *in that gizmo*.
    • **Augmentation dissolvers** will de-augment the item, destroying *all gizmos/perks*.
    • **Equipment separators** will remove and return the gizmos to you, but *require items to be level 15 or higher.*

⬥ Augmented items (and the perks in them) will not work unless you have divine charges <:divinecharge:1010485547598356530> stored. You can either create them at the workbench or buy them at the GE.

.
> __**Augmentation**__
.tag:augment
__**How to Augment Items**__
⬥ Items can be augmented in two ways:
    • **For most items**: click Augmentor → use on Item
    • **Degrade-to-dust items**: take fully-repaired Item + Divine Charges <:divinecharge:1010485547598356530> + Augmentor → create augmented item at Workbench

.
__**Item Levels**__
⬥ **Augmented items gain experience as you use them**, increasing their item level.
⬥ Maximum item levels can be increased by discovering blueprints:
    • Level 5 - at 4 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • Level 10 - at 27 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • Level 15 - at 60 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
    • Level 20 - at 99 <:Invention:689509250946695292>
⬥ **As items increase in level, they get some benefits, notably**:
    • Level 3 - disassembles for 2x components
    • Level 6 - disassembles for 3x components
    • Level 8 - gizmos are returned when disassembling
    • Level 9 - disassembles for 4x components
    • Level 10 - disassembles for maximum experience
    • Level 12 - siphons for maximum experience
    • Level 15 - equipment separators can be used on this item
    • Level 20 - perks are 10% more effective on this item

⬥ Note that items use less charges <:divinecharge:1010485547598356530> as they level up, making them more efficient.

.
> __**Machines**__
.tag:machines
⬥ Towards the back of the Invention guild, you'll be able to create machines (starting at level 60).
⬥ These machines can do some very handy stuff such as High Alching <:highalch:937093290631786496> and disassembling items, and even partially processing items (e.g. logs → planks, herbs → unf potions, etc.)
⬥ Up to 5 spots for machines (pink), and one spot for a power generator (red) are available:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/An6ZlWP.png
.
⬥ Clicking on an empty machine hotspot you'll see a list of the machines you can make and the components/items needed to make them.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/zufYzSW.png
.
⬥ **Machines are powered by divine charges** <:divinecharge:1010485547598356530>.
    • Charges are added to the power generator to supply power to the rest of the machines.
⬥ **Machines each consume a certain level of 'power**' - i.e. a way to limit how many machines you have at once.
    • This limit increases as you build better generators.
⬥ **Machines cannot be turned on/off - to change your power allocation, you must destroy/rebuild them.**

.
> __**Tech Trees**__
.tag:tech
__**What Are Tech Trees**__
⬥ Tech trees are found on the small noticeboard next to the bank in the Invention guild.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VLXAeM6.png
⬥ They're used to unlock additional blueprints to discover create items.
⬥ Currency for unlocking blueprints can be gained by completing tasks for each tree.
    • Tasks usually require handing in components or finished items.
    • One task is added every 12h, stacking up to 5.

.
__**Dwarven Tech Tree**__
The following blueprints are part of the Dwarven tree:
⬥ Corporeal components
⬥ Sprinkler MK1
⬥ Mining Accumulator
⬥ Book switcher
⬥ Calorie bomb
⬥ Auto-sanctifier
⬥ Kinetic Cyclone
⬥ Dungeoneering lock melter

.
__**Goblin Tech Tree**__
The following blueprints are part of the Goblin tree:
⬥ Pestiferous components
⬥ Mechanised chinchompas
⬥ Woodcutting accumulator
⬥ B.A.N.K Stander
⬥ Monkey mind-control helmet
⬥ Dungeoneering party simulator
⬥ Electrified box trap
⬥ Oldak coil

.
> __**Ancient Invention**__ <:archaeology:941211288665739274> <:Invention:689509250946695292>
.tag:ancient
__**What Is It**__
⬥ With the release of Archaeology <:archaeology:941211288665739274>, ancient invention was introduced to the game.
⬥ This includes **new tools** (higher tier t70→t80), **new gizmos** <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382> <:ancientarmourgizmo:697405383769194516> <:ancienttoolgizmo:697405383513473046>, **new components & perks**.
⬥ 85 Invention <:Invention:689509250946695292> (boostable from 68 with an extreme potion <:extremeinventionpotion:1032540072169439242>) is required to discover, create and use ancient gizmos.
    • Ancient blueprints technically require 95 <:archaeology:941211288665739274> *but* blueprints and ancient components are both tradeable on the GE.

*Note: Ironmen <:iron:764086050959392778> **cannot **boost for this, and will have to get the blueprints themselves at level 95.*

.
__**Ancient Gizmos**__
⬥ **Ancient gizmos have 9 slots** (vs. the regular 5 slots of normal gizmos), allowing for more perk choices and combinations.
⬥ This makes getting a starter set of perks for PvM very easy - see <#553632787639435284>.
⬥ **Keep in mind though that as with regular gizmos, it's not worth going for high-end perks till 120 Invention.**
⬥ Discovering 'perfect' rated blueprints is also a good source of XP early on.

.
> __**How to Train Invention**__
.tag:training
__**Training Methods**__
⬥ **Invention is primarily trained by disassembling or siphoning augmented equipment** once it reaches an appropriate level.
    • Items disassemble for full XP from level 10 or higher.
    • They siphon for full XP from level 12 or higher.
    • You can siphon/disassemble at lower levels, but this gives less XP.

⬥ Items gain XP and level up as you use them appropriately (combat items when fighting, skilling tools when skilling).
⬥ **In general: faster XP gain → faster item levelling → faster Invention <:Invention:689509250946695292> XP**
⬥ XP Capacitors (tradeable on the GE) should be used to double the rate of item XP gain, effectively doubling your Invention XP/hr.

.
__**Level 1-4**__
⬥ Tutorial puts you at level 4.

.
__**Level 4-27**__
⬥ Discover item maximum level 5 blueprint.
⬥ Buy any cheap augmentable weapon (crystal halberd or black salamanders for example) and level it up to level 5.
⬥ At level 16, research augmented body armour and buy some cheap augmentable armour and level up to level 5.
⬥ When your weapons / armour reach level 5, disassemble them for xp. Do this until you hit level 27.

.
**__Level 27-60__**
⬥ Discover item maximum level 10 blueprint.
⬥ Continue as before but disassemble your weapons/armor at level 10 instead.
⬥ At level 45, research augmented leg armour. Buy some cheap augmentable leg armour and level it up along with your torso and weapon.

.
**__Level 60__**
⬥ Discover item maximum level 15 blueprint.
⬥ Stop using your cheap gear - augment your main gear and level it up.
⬥ At level 12, siphon the items for XP. Repeat till you reach level 120.

__**Blueprints**__
⬥ Extreme invention pots <:extremeinventionpotion:1032540072169439242> (requiring 85 Herblore <:Herblore:689554435583508558>) let you research blueprints up to 17 levels earlier.
    • If you can't make them, use super Invention potions instead.
⬥ Blueprints will give double XP on DXP weekends.

.
__**Perks & Components**__
⬥ Augmentable items will disassemble for more components at level 3 (2x), 6 (3x) and 9 (4x).
⬥ **Level items up for disassembly when possible, *especially* for expensive components.**
⬥ Scavenging 3/4 <:scavenging4:1005934140669046824> perk can add up to a lot of uncommon/rare components over time as you PvM.
    • This is especially noticeable when AFK farming, or doing high KPH activities like Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857>
⬥ When going for a specific perk, always calculate the optimal way to get it in advance.
