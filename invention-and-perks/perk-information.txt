⬥ Precise 6 <:p6:712073088769982475> on mainhand damage while using Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> / Defender <:kalphiterepriser:643846849362657280> / Shield <:vengeful:1102553026415313006> switches by approximately 6.9%.
⬥ Aftershock 1 <:as1:689502339891331093> on mainhand to prevent losing stacks when using a switch (and adds some extra damage).
⬥ On 2H Weapons, Precise 6 Ruthless 1 <:p6:712073088769982475> <:ruthless1:712244800924942396> can be used instead.

.
__**Aftershock 4 Equilibrium 2**__ <:as4:712074245202772009> <:eq2:689502258424971564>
⬥ When paired with Precise 6 Aftershock 1 <:p6:712073088769982475> <:as1:689502339891331093>, is approximately a 9.6% DPM boost over having no weapon perks at all.

    • This combination is considerably cheaper than attempting to get Precise 6 + Equilibrium 2 <:p6:712073088769982475> <:eq2:689502258424971564> on one gizmo.

⬥ For Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> setups, this perk is used as a switch for Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> before swapping back to main camping perks.
    • Can be combo-ed as Planted Feet Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336> <:pf:689501925770919981> to put on a defender for magic to save on a switch.

__**Biting 3**__ <:b3:689502516874051590>
⬥ Biting 3 <:b3:689502516874051590> gives a 6% (6.6% at level 20) chance of forcing a crit each hit. This results in an average hit increase of 3.8% (4.18% at level 20).
⬥ Approximately a 3.8% DPM boost over not having Biting <:biting4:712073087809617931> at all.
⬥ Relatively inexpensive and easy to obtain.

.
__**Impatient 4**__ <:imp4:712073088204013640>
⬥ Impatient 4 <:imp4:712073088204013640> has a 36% (39.6% at level 20) chance to grant 3% more adren when using a basic ability.

.
__**Enhanced Devoted 4**__ <:enhdev4:712073087507628035>
⬥ Enhanced Devoted 4 <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> has a 18% (19.8% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability.
⬥ The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss. *Assuming the correct overhead prayers*, this works out to approximately:
    • 18% damage reduction against targets that attack less than once every 2.4s (4t).
    • 30.5% against targets that attack once every 2.4s (4t).
⬥ This takes priority over the normal Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perk, however the normal Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perk can activate during the time Enhanced Devotion <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> is active.
⬥ Pairing this with Crackling <:crack4:712073087662686249> on legs can make armor switches cheaper, as legs tend to cost less than bodies.

.
__**Turtling 4**__ <:turt4:712073737377284146>
⬥ Increases the duration and cooldown of Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> by 40%.

.
__**Relentless 5 Crackling 4**__ <:relentless5:712244800920748092> <:crack4:712073087662686249>
⬥ Relentless 5 <:relentless5:712244800920748092> gives a 5% (5.5% at level 20) chance to not consume adrenaline when using an ability that requires adrenaline.
    • This includes thresholds, defensives, special attacks and ultimate abilites.
⬥ Crackling 4 <:crack4:712073087662686249> deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds.
⬥ As Biting <:biting4:712073087809617931> is expensive, and Relentless <:relentless5:712244800920748092> is a perk useful in all situations, putting them both on your body armor allows you to use different augmented legs with different perk setups.

.
__**Impatient 4 Devoted 4**__ <:imp4:712073088204013640> <:dev4:712073087713280033>
⬥ When not using Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> , it is preferred to combo Impatient 4 <:imp4:712073088204013640> with Devoted 4 <:dev4:712073087713280033>.
⬥ Can be combo-ed with other perks if you opt to use Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> as well.
⬥ Devoted 4 <:dev4:712073087713280033> has a 12% (13.2% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability.
⬥ The effectiveness of Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> increases as enemies attack faster. *Assuming the correct overhead prayers*, this leads to approximately:
    • 12% damage reduction against targets that attack less than once every 2.4s (4t).
    • 21.4% against targets that attack once every 2.4s (4t).

.
__**Invigorating 4 X**__ <:invig4:712073087859949570>
⬥ Invigorating 4 <:invig4:712073087859949570> gives 40% increased adrenaline from auto attacks.
    • The adrenaline from auto attacks depending on the combat style and weapon speed used.
    • For Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> weapons, this increase is always 0.8%.
⬥ Can easily be combo-ed with an auxillary perk.
    • e.g. Invigorating 4 Mobile <:invig4:712073087859949570> <:mob:689501908628799488> switch for Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> when you want the shorter cooldown.
⬥ Most impactful for Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> setups but can be beneficial for all if you use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> a lot.

.

    • This works on all damage except hard typeless, such as Araxxor's cleave.
⬥ This can be good for some end-game ranged setups utilizing the ECB <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> since Lucky <:lucky6:890542428287795221> will work even when Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is active, unlike Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> / Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035>.
⬥ Can be paired with an auxillary perk such as Absorbative <:absorbative4:890542428556230666> or Hoarding.
