## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
Combat is a key pillar of the game and can be overwhelming at times - it need not be this way! The aim of this channel is to help you get up and running with some ideas on how to train your levels whilst being fully immersed into the world of RuneScape.

We will cover in this channel:
⬥ Some key tips before you start
⬥ Early game combat quests to help you gain some levels whilst being immersed in the lore
⬥ Some training suggestions (these are not mandatory)
⬥ An introduction to War's Retreat and some further quest information relating to combat.
.
## __Some key tips before you start__
⬥ Hit chance i.e. your damage scaling when attacking monsters can be viewed as a percentage on the monster's HP bar. The higher the number, the greater your damage.
    • Wearing "off-style" armour e.g. a melee weapon with magic armour severely impacts your hit chance in a negative manner! Be sure to match your armour combat style with your weapon combat style.
⬥ Attack <:attack:689509250472476758> affects melee accuracy and its level is what determines what melee weapons you can equip. Strength <:strength:689509250879324165> determines your damage dealt with melee weapons.
⬥ The best defence is a good offence: weapon upgrades take precedence over armour upgrades!
⬥ You will level quickly in the early levels - if you feel like you can survive without issues, skip an armour upgrade and save your gold for the following one.
⬥ When using Magic <:magic:689504724159823906> you should regularly upgrade your auto-cast to the highest available spell tier. You can find out a spell's damage level cap by checking its tooltip.
    •  *For example: Air strike's damage cap is at level 16 - you can upgrade to Air bolt at level 17.*
⬥ If you need help, don't struggle in silence! You can ask questions in the help channels of:
    • The official Runescape Discord [invite link](<https://discord.com/invite/rs>) <#723915055976153138>
    • The PvM Encyclopedia [invite link](<https://discord.gg/invite/pvme>) <#656898197561802760>

## __Combat <:combat:797896050370281523> Training__
If questing isn't your cup of tea - getting stuck into killing some monsters might be more your style. Some thing to keep in mind are:

⬥ Further levelling focuses on killing monsters for xp.
⬥ Upgrade your weapons to a higher tier when you can!
⬥ Include area-of-effect (AoE) abilities as they become available. Check ability tooltips.
    • Ranged <:range:580168050121113623>: [chinchompas](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chinchompa>) turn non-AoE abilities into a 3x3 AoE attack.
    • Melee <:melee:1096130867279171706>: [halberds](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Halberd>) gives a longer range on AoE attacks.
    • Magic <:magic:689504724159823906> has fewer early game AoE abilities.

We also have some pre-created ability bars and gear progression suggestions to help you slay these monsters. You can check them out here:
⬥ Early <:magic:689504724159823906> upgrade order & ability bars:<#1232420737034223746>

## __Quests__
.tag:quests
⬥ For a list of quests with useful PvM unlocks, see __**Quest Unlocks**__ in <#1025569719056597042>.
⬥ One of the first useful unlocks to aim for is the tier 3 [Infernal Puzzle Box](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Infernal_Puzzle_Box>) <:infernalpuzzlebox:994189299681607800>, which prevents your adrenaline from draining when outside of combat.
    • You can find the box in [The Zamorakian Undercity](<https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Zamorakian_Undercity#Getting_there>) specifically [here](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Infernal_Puzzle_Box#mapFullscreen>). Completing the [Daughter of Chaos](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Daughter_of_Chaos/Quick_guide>) quest (40 Archaeology <:archaeology:941211288665739274> and 40 Divination <:divination:1042453694735712286>) unlocks tier 2.
    • To unlock tier 3, complete the [Civil War I](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Civil_War_I_(miniquest)/Quick_guide>) miniquest, and the [Gross Misconduct achievement](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Gross_Misconduct>).
⬥ Two quests also worth mentioning are [The Temple at Senntisten](<https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Temple_at_Senntisten/Quick_guide>) and [Plague's End](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Plague%27s_End/Quick_guide>). The first unlocks curses, which are basically stronger prayers. The second unlocks better overloads and combination potions.
⬥ Note that quests are more rewarding the sooner you do them, due to how level XP scaling works.
