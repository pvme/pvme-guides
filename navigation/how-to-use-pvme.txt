> **__Bossing Path__**
.tag:mastery
*Link: <#1020546518941454438>*

The PvME bossing path provides an avenue to progress your skills and reach higher-tier PvM goals. It helps set objectives based on learning stages to measure your progression. It's perfect if you're new to bossing and unsure of where to start or looking for objectives to facilitate advancing your current abilities.

> **__The Mastery System__**
.tag:bossingpath
*Link: <#1123728326859690045> / <#1123728596444397629>*

The PvME Mastery System is a great way to gauge your PvM progress. It provides meaningful goals to shoot for as you learn new content or hone your skills at familiar encounters. There are multiple tiers of mastery ranks, each one granting its own unique role colour for all to see.

.
> **__PvME Boss Guides__**
.tag:boss
The focus of our community is providing the best text guides possible for every encounter and players of all skill levels. Described below is the general composition of our guides. Each guide contains a table of contents at the bottom, with links to help you navigate the guide quickly.

.
__**Header**__
.tag:header
Each guide contains a header image, containing a few key pieces of information for each encounter:
⬥ The <:sgb:626466665848242186> icon indicates boss size, for example 3x3 tiles.
⬥ The <:venomblood:841419289714229258> icon indicates whether boss is poisonable with a tick (poisonable) or a cross (non-poisonable).
⬥ The hex weapon indicator (<:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> / <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> / <:terramaul:602561894829522954>) shows which hex weapon the boss is susceptible to.
⬥ The summoning icon <:Summoning:583430259064569856> indicates whether the boss can be damaged directly by a summoning familiar.

.
__**Suggested Presets**__
.tag:presets
⬥ PvME provides one or more suggested preset(s) in every strategy guide.
⬥ Historically, presets were presented as images with a link to a full breakdown of the items used.
⬥ Since the creation of <https://pvme.github.io/preset-maker/>, PvME is in the process of converting presets to a more condensed format, complete with familiars, relics, and more.
⬥ Examples of both formats can be found below.

⬥ **Presets *usually* __DO NOT__ need to be strictly copied.**
    • Downgrading a little bit is usually fine.
    • For example, in *most cases* where a Praesul wand and Imperium core are used <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>, you can downgrade to a Cywir Wand & Orb <:cywirwand:643161591571021824> <:cywirorb:643161591210049556>
    • If a boss guide that has strict gear requirements that **must** be adhered to, it will be clearly stated.
    • **If unsure, ask questions relating to presets and their contents in <#656898197561802760>.**
⬥ Presets in full boss guides generally assume best in slot perks listed in <#553632787639435284>
⬥ Presets in basic and AFK boss guides generally assume basic perks listed in <#553632787639435284>

**Note: Downgrading your preset from the recommended may mean that rotations will need some extra improvisation.**

__**Mechanics & Suggested Ability Rotations**__
.tag:rots
⬥ Following basic information and preset suggestions, guides will generally mention:
    • Specific boss mechanics.
    • DPS ability rotations.

**The rotations listed in full boss guides are designed for optimal kills!**
Some considerations to take when following these are:

⬥ Abilities used to deal with specific mechanics **should be adhered to strictly**.
⬥ Most DPS rotations are generally only suggestions and need not be followed exactly
    • Feel free to adapt them as you see fit!
⬥ Due to RNG you may need to improvise these rotations based on damage dealt, adrenaline etc.

Many of our guides make use of abbreviations. Check them out in this document: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZmDhx-SJsrVo0iTNwgMN3YsuJ9CrHcySd3hptvz3Ds/>.
