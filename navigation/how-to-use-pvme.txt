Welcome to PvM Encyclopedia, the largest collection of up-to-date combat information.

This channel will serve as a how-to guide on utilising this server for your needs. Let's go over what the server contains:

Our social channels are located here:
.tag:social
{
  "embed": {
    "title": "Social channels",
    "description": "These channels are for the community",
    "color": 39423,

      }
    ]
  }
}

Followed by our RuneScape channels, split into two categories:
.tag:channels
{
  "embed": {
    "title": "RuneScape channels",
    "description": "These channels are RuneScape related, for players to find help or post their achievements",
    "color": 39423,
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "RuneScape Channels",
        "value": "<#656898197561802760>\n<#557699151291351060>\n<#536062588090318850>\n<#538137911292329986>\n<#534563158304620564>",
	"inline": true
      },
      {
        "name": "Request Channels",
        "value": "<#1019648841965916220>\n<#827692629197324348>\n<#537042924026724353>",
	"inline": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
.embed:json
After this, the Encyclopaedia side of the Discord begins, split into several channels. A variety of combat information is offered, followed by individual boss guides.

To start, the single most useful feature for this server, and informations discords in general, is the hotkey **__Ctrl+K__**. PvME has a vast number of channels, so this is the first step to finding what you need quickly.

Next up, the server <#920506750250135552>. It contains a list of all of our guides, whether they be boss guides or combat information channels. Clicking on the channel name in any of the embeds will take you directly there.

.
> **__PVM Help__**
.tag:help
⬥ If you're still unsure and have a combat-related question, then <#656898197561802760> is the place for you. A welcoming environment frequented by some of the game's most knowledgeable players, chances are if you have a question, we'll know the answer. If not, we'll know where to find it.
    • To make the best use of this channel, follow these tips
    • For longer questions requiring a large amount of information, e.g. Preset help, understanding fundamentals of a certain style or boss, then open up a thread to keep your message from being lost.
    • For quick, short questions, feel free to drop them in the chat. If there's already a conversation going on and chances are it might be missed, try using a thread.

⬥ To help with commonly asked questions, we introduced commands. These can be used in the <#534563158304620564> channel to provide some quick information on a variety of frequently enquired subjects. A list of commands can be found in <#996854552353583185>.

.
> **__VOD Review__**
.tag:vod
⬥ A great way to improve your performance is to record your gameplay. For this purpose, the vod review channels are available for other players to review and give feedback on your videos.

⬥ Post your videos in <#1019648841965916220>, make a thread and name it with the following convention: <Boss> (<Style>) - RSN. Following this, feedback will be posted in the thread to aid your gameplay.

⬥ Another way to measure your progress is the Mastery system. Working your way up the tiers of the mastery system is a great way to express your achievements and track your progress, whether you're a complete learner or an experienced veteran. There's always something new to learn and the resources are available for everyone!

.
> **__Boss Guides__**
.tag:boss
⬥ **Headers**
    • Every boss guide contains a header, drop information, presets and fight information. This information may include mechanics, rotations, and tips and tricks.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/jSMag5g.png
    • The boss header is more than just a pretty start to a guide. It contains some information that you'd immediately want to know when thinking about a boss. This is split into 4 main pieces of information:
        - The Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> icon indicates boss size, whether that be 1x1 all the way up to 20x20, important to understand how much damage your Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> special attack will do.
        - The poison indicator. This will have a check or a cross, to determine whether the boss is poisonable or not, so you can determine if you should be wearing cinderbanes and using weapon poison to increase damage.
        - Then the hex weakness is displayed. The 3 hex-style weapons, the Hexhunter bow <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, Inquisitor's staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>, and the Terrasaur maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> all work on their respective styled mobs, so this icon shows which weapon gains the increased damage effect on the boss.
        - Finally, the Wolf head <:Summoning:583430259064569856> icon shows whether the boss is affected by familiar damage.

.
⬥ **Presets**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Vr2V41u.png
    • These presets typically show best-in-slot gear.
        - **__These are by no means REQUIRED__**, you should downgrade your weapons as necessary, unless the method specifically relies on it.
    • Armour slots represent **__your best power gear for those slots__**
    • Weapon slots represent your best applicable weapon whether that be 2H or DW
        - The MH icon slot represents any mainhand Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> weapon of your choice.

*Note: **__If you don't have any of these items, don't worry, just downgrade as suitable__**, and ask in <#656898197561802760> if you have a question.*

    • For items that aren't typically recognisable, they will be specifically named in the preset.
        - This applies to Essence of Finality Amulets, Weapon Switches, and Miscellaneous items.
    • All of the items in our presets will have more information available in the following channels: <#1020050199785254912> <#1020050173633761290> <#1020050157712191508>
    • Most guides make use of abbreviations, if you're unfamiliar with them, this document <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZmDhx-SJsrVo0iTNwgMN3YsuJ9CrHcySd3hptvz3Ds/> details them.

.
