We're always on the lookout for new editors in <#924484538187522098>, those that want to fix typos, update presets, or make guides tailored for simplicity and easy-to-read.

The following list details the desires and plans that the PvM Encyclopedia staff would like to bring to life, but have no current target date.

⬥ **Combat Tutorial:** An in-depth channel tailored for the returning players to RuneScape, or players wishing to understand combat fundamentals. Aimed to not be overwhelming, while also giving the option for more in-depth knowledge if the reader chooses.

⬥ **Video Narration:** Working with content creators to turn some guides into video format is something we're very interested in. Choosing the desired guide, making a script and ensuring its accessibility and information isn't compromised is part of the process.

⬥ **Announcements in the website:** Back-end work is needed for this to work.

⬥ **Changelog for guides:** Adding when guides were last updated and what was changed. Requires plenty of research and back-end work to figure out the best was to incorperate this without using much space and automate.
