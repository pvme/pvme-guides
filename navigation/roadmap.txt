With the addition of forum channels recently we have opened our <#1020853673317908500> channel as a public forum so we may be as transparent as possible with what you can expect to see coming and any fixes which we will be adding shortly.

We're always on the lookout for new editors in <#924484538187522098>, those that want to fix typos, update presets, or make guides tailored for simplicity and easy-to-read.

The following list details the desires and plans that the PvM Encyclopedia staff would like to bring to life, but have no current target date.

⬥ **Combat Tutorial:** An in-depth channel tailored for the returning players to RuneScape, or players wishing to understand combat fundamentals. Aimed to not be overwhelming, while also giving the option for more in-depth knowledge if the reader chooses.

⬥ **Video Narration:** Working with content creators to turn some guides into video format is something we're very interested in. Choosing the desired guide, making a script and ensuring its accessibility and information isn't compromised is part of the process.

⬥ **Announcements in the website:** Back-end work is needed for this to work.

⬥ **Changelog for guides:** Adding when guides were last updated and what was changed. Requires plenty of research and back-end work to figure out the best was to incorperate this without using much space and automate.
