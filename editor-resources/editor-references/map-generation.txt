.

.
*Notes:*
    a. Check <#1162558489533612063> first for already created maps and variables sets to save you time
    b. You can find map chunks here: <https://mejrs.github.io/>
    d. If struggling to find a specific area check here <https://runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Map/mapIDs>, search for the area you want with ctrl+f, then change the -1 on the mej web address to the corresponding map ID
    e. After the map takes you to the area, set the number BACK to -1, this should take you to the correct area on the main map

2.2. If unsure about the coloured tile markings, enter a number around where you think for player/cannon etc, then tweak and re-run the code

2.3. Choose how many tiles to trim off each side of the image (left,upper,right,bottom)

2.4. Select which legend to use from the listed options

2.5. Remove the `#` from any lines you have set (any lines with a `#` will not be executed)
