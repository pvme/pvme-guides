### Step 1
1.1 Run the first code section by clicking the first play button

.
### Step 2
2.1. Scroll down to the second code section and edit the variables between the two lines of `#########`

.
*Notes:*
    a. Check <#1162558489533612063> first for already created maps and variables sets to save you time
    b. You can find map chunks by visiting <https://mejrs.github.io/>
        ⬩ Turn on the **grid layer** by hovering over the icon in the bottom-right
        ⬩ If you struggle to find a specific area the RS Wiki has a [page listing common locations](<https://runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Map/mapIDs>) - simply replace the `-1` in the mej URL to the corresponding map ID

2.2. If unsure about the coloured tile markings, enter a number around where you think for player/cannon etc, then tweak and re-run the code

2.3. Choose how many tiles to trim off each side of the image (left,upper,right,bottom)

2.4. Select which legend to use from the listed options

2.5. Remove the `#` from any lines you have set (any lines with a `#` will not be executed)

.
### Step 3
3.1. Run the main code
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/hN8YQKzJWk.png
3.2. Wait for the code to execute - you can track its progress at the bottom of your browser

.
### Step 4
4.1. Scroll to the very bottom of the page to view your created map and `right click > save` when happy, or scroll back up and tweak the variables if it's not right

## __Real example__

### The objective: make a player position map for the new Osseous AFK guide.

.
First we find the Rex Matriarch arena (we've had to scroll across Mej's map to find it):
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/4bOVcYUEIk.png

.
Next, we add map gridlines on so we know which map chunks to reference:

.
Now we want to reduce the map to just the Osseous arena (highlighted by the yellow box), which crosses multiple map chunks.
.

.
First we set the x and y values to be of the top tile (63,153)
```
mej_x = 63
mej_y = 153
```

.
Next let's make it so 2 tiles are shown vertically
```
mej_height = 2
mej_width = 1
```

.
If we ran the code now, it would give us this:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/UDpjeF4nPZ.png

.
Let's trim off the sides and press the run button to check our map:
```
left = 1
upper = 43
right = 21
lower = 43
```

.
It's almost there! Let's cut off some of that excess map, put a coloured tile for the player position, and set the legend to show just 'player position':

.
Now let's hit the run button again... we did it!
