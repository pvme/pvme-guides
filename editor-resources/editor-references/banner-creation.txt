## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
⬥ The **PVME Banner Template** should be used atop every guide (where relevant)
⬥ This guide provides the essentials to build you own banner and contribute to PVME!

⬥ The banner itself is 1440 x 600px, and has the following components:
    • A blurry background representing the arena/area the monster lives in
    • The name picture of the monster
    • The monster's size (2x2, 5x5 etc)
    • Whether poison can be used
    • Which weapon the monster is vulnerable to
    • Whether familiar damage can be used

.
## __Guide: Building your banner__
.tag:guide
⬥ There are three steps listed below to follow - if something doesn't make sense then **please** ask for help in <#724129126314803230>
⬥ This guide will work in the following editors:
    • Photoshop
    • Gravit.io
    • PowerPoint
    • Paint.net
⬥ Unfortunately, MS Paint will __not__ work as it does not support transparency

.
### Step 1: Create a blurry background and add the boxes
.tag:step1
1. Save [this template file](<https://img.pvme.io/images/x5oFrjy7Kx.png>) to your machine and open it in your chosen editor
    a. *Note: If using PowerPoint, unlock aspect ratio to fix pixel dimensions, then type the pixel value into the boxes that say "cm/inch" (e.g. "1440px")*
3. In-game, visit the monster's area and use the Freecam or [Orb of oculus](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Orb_of_oculus>) to find a nice backdrop for your banner
    a. *Note: A darker environment [skybox](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Skyboxes_and_filters>) will usually make the banner look cleaner - experiment!*
4. Screenshot the chosen area, and copy the image into your editor
5. Re-order your objects so the background is behind/under the template you started with
6. Crop the background image to the same size as the template
7. Add a strong blur effect to the background image so you can still see the general vibe of the area but not the details
    a. *Note: If using PowerPoint, right-click image → Picture corrections → Sharpness (-70 to -90%)*

**Good job! You should now have a banner that looks something like below:**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/wMPYOsxghY.png

.
### Step 2: Add the monster's name and image
.tag:step2
8. [Download the Russo One font](<https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Russo+One>) and install it to your machine
9. Open and copy [this guide layer](<https://img.pvme.io/images/av8OFsrGoq.png>) into your editor
10. Staying within the red lines, add a text box (start with font size 102px) and enter the boss' name
    a. *Note: If the monster has a long name, reducing the font-size is okay as long as it stays within the red lines*
    b. *Note: If using PowerPoint, you will need to eyeball the font-size rather than use pixel font-sizes*
12. Centre the boss' name horizontally in the middle of the white boxes (it should be off-centre to the left)
13. Get the image of the monster from the Runescape Wiki:
    a. Open the Runescape Wiki, navigate to the monster's page
    b. Click on the main image - it should maximise the image file
    c. Right-click download this image
    d. Import it into your editor (note: this is an important step in some editors, as copying sometimes loses the transparent background)
14. Move the monster's image to the empty space on the right, and resize as appropriate
15. You can now safely hide or delete the red guide layer

**Good job! You should now have a banner that looks something like below:**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/4DdX0AEOHn.png

.
### Step 3: Add the summary boxes
.tag:step3
16. Now comes the fiddly part! Copy in the relevant icons from the below list to the remaining white boxes, __ensuring they are centred within their box__.
		a. *Note: The only non-icon box is the bottom-left, where you will need to use the same font as before to type in the boss' size (start with font size 53px)*
		b. *Note: You should be able find the boss' size in a table on the [Seren godbow Wiki page](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_godbow#Recommended_bosses>)*
		c. *Note: If using PowerPoint, the align tools are under "Arrange"*

.
⬥ Icons (download or copy these into the editor as required):
    • [Box 3 - Inquisitor Staff](<https://img.pvme.io/images/XWT3opBawS.png>)
    • [Box 3 - Hexhunter Bow](<https://img.pvme.io/images/AgiCM4irg5.png>)
    • [Box 3 - Terrasaur Maul](<https://img.pvme.io/images/9p8Vgvlnr6.png>)
    • [Box 3 - Omni guard](<https://img.pvme.io/images/aaZzcDbzQ1.png>)
    • [Box 4 - Familiar](<https://img.pvme.io/images/mBlPRJIESa.png>)
    • [Tick](<https://img.pvme.io/images/3e7tQSVVvV.png>)
    • [Cross](<https://img.pvme.io/images/1i1nfMnNwt.png>)

**Good job! You should now have a finished banner that looks something like below:**
