### Steps
1. **Grab the background image** of the boss you're looking for
    a. If using <https://runescape.wiki> then:
        ⬩ Do not right-click the image on the NPC's main page (it is low quality/size)
        ⬩ Instead, click on the image and download the full-size version

.
2. Once added into the web app, you can **move (by dragging) and zoom** (by scrolling) the background image
    a. Try to make the background image in the bottom-right
    b. Scroll through forum images to get an idea of the style

.
3. Download your file by clicking the `create icon` button
    a. Your icon should be a `.png` file - if not, use a converter tool online first such as <https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png>

.
4. Edit the relevant forum inside <#689575078698287152> by typing `/forum edit` and following the instructions

.
5. **Et voila!** It's that simple.
