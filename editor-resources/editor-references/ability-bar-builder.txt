## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
⬥ Some guides require sharing an action bar to go alongside them, but it can be difficult to make in-game if you don't have spare action bars, or if you don't have the required abilities to do so unlocked.
⬥ A couple of tools have been developed that make this process easier.

.
## __Ability Bar Builder__
.tag:abilitybarbuilder
⬥ Try it here: **<https://pvme.github.io/ability-bar-builder/>**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/H3MDTbTKzK.png
⬥ This tool (created by <@102870112314335232>) allows you to quickly create custom revolution bars that you can then take screenshots of, or directly export as `.png`.
    • You can then send it to <#771436827214086154> to get a image link to use in guides generated.
⬥ To use it, **simply click on an ability bar slot and choose an ability to go there**.
⬥ You can use the toggles above to change the bar length, toggle the yellow outline on/off, and remove the white number icons.

.
## __Revo Bar Tool__
.tag:revobartool
**Note**: This tool may sometimes be down (towards the end of a month), due to excessive traffic.

⬥ Try it here: **<https://revocalc.fly.dev/>**

⬥ This tool was created by <@335084211067289601> and allows you to create custom revolution bars, similar to the **Ability Bar Builder.**
⬥ To use it, **drag and drop abilities from the menus above into the bar**. To clear a slot on the bar, simply drag out the ability from it.
⬥ You can also simulate using the revolution bar in combat, to compare its long-term sustained DPS with other bars.
