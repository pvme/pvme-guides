## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
The PVMe Spreadsheet is a Google Sheet document that is used to store dynamic information for use in guides. This includes things like prices of items, values of invention components, calculating boss revenue, etc. which can change over time. This guide is a brief overview of the sheet, and how you can use data from it in your guides.

The spreadsheet can be found at the following link.

## __Using Spreadsheet Data In Guides__
.tag:howto
⬥ Using data from the spreadsheet in a guide is very straightforward.
⬥ Values from the sheet can be accessed using the following command: `data_pvme:<sheet>!<cell>`, replacing the contents of `<sheet>` and `<cell>` with the **sheet name** and **cell number** respectively.
⬥ *When posted (by the PvME Bot), the command text will get replaced by the value present in that cell*.

⬥ For example, the following sentence might be in a guide:
```
Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> is a very powerful ability, but is also quite expensive, costing <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvmе:Unlocks!B15$.
```
⬥ When posted by the bot, it will look like the following:

*Note: The command syntax can also be found in the **Commands** dropdown menu in the web guide editor tool*.
