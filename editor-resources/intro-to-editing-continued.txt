## __Essential Tools__
.tag:Essential
These are tools that are used in almost every guide:
*Note: Tutorials for all tools can be found in their respective forums in <#1020841129064812646>*
⬥ [Guide Editor](<https://pvme.io/guide-editor/>) - Has all text formatting tools built in, as well as the style guide rule set integrated.
⬥ [Style Guide](<https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1250465564082704456>) - Has all of our formatting rules explained in great detail. This is built into the Guide Editor and will display any broken styling rules in the bottom-left window of the Guide Editor website.
.
    • Example: https://img.pvme.io/images/hKXqQoi3fs.png
.
        ⬩ There was an empty space after the last word on line 12, so the Guide Editor informed me to delete it.
⬥ [Templates](<https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1250465568255901787>) - Has the skeleton structure for various guides/embeds pre-made so you can just copy paste and fill in blanks as needed to give you a head start on guide creation. This channel also has information on how to format text within embeds.
    • *Note: There are tools built into the Guide Editor that offer the same functionality*
⬥ [Preset Generator](<https://pvme.io/preset-maker/>) - Used to provide a standardized UI so the layout looks the same across all guides.
    • Click an inventory slot and type the name of an item to see it populate the slot.
⬥ [Ability Bar Builder](<https://pvme.io/ability-bar-builder/>) - Used for creating Revolution bars for AFK and Slayer guides.
    • Click a slot on the bar and select an ability from the popup.
⬥ [Rotation Builder](<https://pvme.io/rotation-builder/>) - Has built-in autoformatting tools to turn common ability names into emoji code output which you can copy/paste into the guide editor.
    • Example: gbarge automatically becomes <:gbarge:535532879250456578> when typed into the rotation builder.

.
## __Niche Tools__
.tag:Niche
These are the extra tools that editors can use to make their guides more pretty and refined:
*Note: Tutorials for all tools can be found in their respective forums in <#1020841129064812646>. If you are not comfortable using these tools, do your best to explain what is needed in <#724129126314803230> and ask someone else to make them for you to add to the guide later.*
⬥ [Tile Map Generator](<https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1246040043542417450>) - Used for making map pictures with gridlines on them to mark exact tiles to place cannons/player standing spots/boss spawn locations.
⬥ [Banner Builder](<https://pvme.io/banner-builder/>) - Used for creating banners for every boss guide that describes their size and susceptibilities to things like poison or familiar damage.
.
⬥ [Hyperlinked Emojis](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvme/pvme-guides/master/editor-resources/editor-references/hyperlinked-emojis.txt>) - A raw document of emoji codes that link the emoji item to the appropriate wiki page for the item.
    • Example: Opening the website and using `ctrl + F` to search for `Ascension Crossbow` will show you a line that has this text: `[Ascension crossbow](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Ascension_crossbow>) <:ascmh:513190158468775936>`. If you copy paste that whole line and post it into the Guide Editor, it will display as [Ascension crossbow](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Ascension_crossbow>) <:ascmh:513190158468775936>.
⬥ [Emoji Combinations](<https://discord.com/channels/534508796639182860/1250465610903585000>) - A channel with content similar to Hyperlinked Emojis. It has quick access copy paste text for common combinations of emojis such as `<:graspingpouchblack:892816436974735361> <:bloodrune:536252658970001409> <:astralrune:536252658961481769> <:bodyrune:536252659301089280> <:soulrune:536252660333019136>`, which will display in the Guide Editor as <:graspingpouchblack:892816436974735361> <:bloodrune:536252658970001409> <:astralrune:536252658961481769> <:bodyrune:536252659301089280> <:soulrune:536252660333019136>.
⬥ [Forum Icon Builder](<https://pvme.io/forum-icon-builder/>) - Used for creating icons for our Discord forums.

.tag:guide
Here's a quick overview of the steps taken to make guides from scratch:
1. Open the Guide Editor.
2. Click `Templates`.
3. Select the guide you want to make. For this, I'll choose a standard guide.
4. Create a banner for the boss using the [Banner Builder](<https://pvme.io/banner-builder/>), or ask someone in <#724129126314803230> to create one for you.
    a. These are archived in the [PvME Spreadsheet](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGM9MBUG2bQVbHxlm86Xfs60soFcjINSOrPv1WL3Vgw/edit?gid=1657882095#gid=1657882095>) in the `Art Resources` tab.
6. Intro: Describe the boss where the template requests the info.
7. Presets and Relics: Use the [Preset Generator](<https://pvme.io/preset-maker/>), or post your preset from in-game, describe the relics/niche items used, and ask someone in <#724129126314803230> to create the preset for you.
8. Mechanics: Describe the mechanics where the template requests the info.
9. The Fight: Describe an overview of the fight where the template requests the info.
10. Rotations: Utilise the [Rotation Builder](<https://pvme.io/rotation-builder/>) to get your rotations written down quickly, then hit the `copy discord` button. Then paste that copied output into this section of the guide editor.
11. Example Kills: Put a couple youtube video links showcasing quality kills here
12. Table of Contents: Click the `Table of Contents` dropdown button and select `Categorized`. Click `Copy`, then paste that copied output at the bottom of the guide.
13. Click `Export to .txt file` and paste the copied output into <#1020853673317908500> which will upload as a file. Describe your guide in the suggestion and ask that someone uploads it to GitHub for you.
