All of our guides are hosted on Github, this is an online service which allows for anyone to make changes to our guides.

**Before starting there are two important things to know:**
⬥ Don't be scared, you wont break anything!
⬥ If you are unsure about **anything** feel free to ping a member of the editing staff in <#724129126314803230>

***Note:** Make sure that your Github account DOES NOT dox you. It is recommended to use a seperate account to work etc, as username and email are visable.*
