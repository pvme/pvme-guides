## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
This guide will go over an assortment of common issues you may encounter while working with Github, as well as a few helpful things you can do to streamline your workflow.
*Note: You can always ask any editor or staff for help with GitHub at any time.*

.
## __Frequently Used Terminology__
.tag:keywords
⬥ **Repository**
    • A collection of all the files and folders for a single project, that is tracked and version controlled.
⬥ **Fork**
    • A *copy* of an entire repository. A user can *fork* a repository to get a personal copy.
⬥ **Commit**
    • Essentially a 'snapshot' of your repository. Think of it like a checkpoint in a video game. Going back to a particular commit shows the entire repository as it was at that point in time. You commit after making your changes, to prepare for a pull request.
⬥ **Pull Request**
    • A request to merge *your changes* into the *main repository*, to be accepted by someone with appropriate permissions.

## __Common Problems__
.tag:trouble
### Failed Checks
.tag:failedchecks
⬥ PvME GitHub is set up to automatically check for valid formatting and styling. There are a number of checks, such as:
    • Trailing whitespace - extra space at the end of a line
    • Improper spacing around emojis - emojis must be surrounded by a space on either side
    • Message length exceeded (too many characters) - messages cannot exceed 2000 characters
    • Invalid embed formatting - creates an invalid embed object.
    • Invalid commands - any `.command:` used must be a valid command.
⬥ Checks failing can be avoided by using the **web editor** (<https://pvme.github.io/guide-editor/>) to edit your content before adding it to GitHub, as it runs the same style checks that pull requests use. For more information, check out <#1020843193509629972>.
⬥ If your pull request fails due to a check, it will inform you. Click on **Details** on the check to see why it has failed, and what you can do to fix it.
⬥ Consider the following example:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ZxizF57.png
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/qdZjUvf.png
⬥ The bottom red square tells you what the error is. In this case, the message starting at line 108 and ending at line 139 has too many characters.
⬥ To fix this, click the *Edit File* option in the following image, to open up editing again to make appropriate changes.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/WHpF7Wq.png
⬥ In this case, we break the single large message into 2 separate messages by hitting `Enter`, entering a single period `.` and hitting `Enter` again. Then commit these changes, and it will update the pull request.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/fTIpYv5.png
⬥ Your Pull Request should now be error-free once the checks complete again.

.
### Checks Are Stuck
.tag:stuckchecks
⬥ Rarely, the style and syntax checks may get stuck, neither succeeding nor failing. In such an event, usually merging a different minor pull request tends to resolve the issue.
⬥ Checks can take some time to complete at times, so wait for at least 20-30 minutes before it is considered an issue.
⬥ In case this occurs, you can contact an editor or staff for assistance.

.
### Your Branch Is 'X' Commits Behind Master
.tag:commitdiff
⬥ When you make a new fork, your fork will look like this:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/j3kEy55.png
⬥ However, after some time it may look something like this:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ztJQ0wj.png
⬥ This is because changes might have happened to the main repository (`'X' commits behind`) and it is no longer longer in-sync with your copy. This may cause issues when making a pull request.
⬥ To resolved this, **the simplest solution is to delete your fork, and make a new fork of the PvME repository**.
⬥ This will give you a fresh, up-to-date copy, and get rid of any lingering issues.

***For more experienced users**: PvME squashes and merges all pull requests. This causes a difference in commit hashes, which is why your branch will be both ahead AND behind in commits after a pull request is accepted. You can clean this up by discarding commits from accepted PRs and syncing your branch to pvme:master. Or by resetting your branch to pvme:master. Or just delete and start over.|*

## __Pull Requests__
.tag:pr
.
### Multiple Changes & Updating an Existing Pull Request
⬥ It is possible to include changes to multiple files within the same Pull Request, and to amend files you have already modified as part of that Pull Request.
⬥ This can be helpful to reduce the number of PRs being opened, and remove the need of closing a PR and reopening it if a mistake has been made.

*Note: It is assumed you have already forked the repository.*

⬥ Consider the scenario: a pull request has been made, with changes to *one* file, visible in the *Files Changed* tab.

.
### Modify an Existing File in the Pull Request
.tag:modifypr
To make an a change to a file that already contains a change, *in the same pull request*, do the following.
⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request, and go to the *Files Changed* tab.
⬥ Go to the top right corner of the file you wish to update, click the three dots, then *Edit File*.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/h2i3Rkb.jpg
⬥ Make whatever additional changes you like, and then *Commit directly to the xxx branch*.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/GbkYLNi.png
⬥ Navigate back to your Pull Request, and the additional change should be included!

.
### Add a New File to the Pull Request
.tag:addpr
To edit a different file, and include it in the same pull request, do as follows,
⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request and click on the name of your branch, here:
    • You are now looking at the main directory of your own branch, where all files will reside.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ylNa85w.png
⬥ Locate the additional file you would like to change, open it, and then click the edit icon.

⬥ Make whatever changes you like, and then *Commit directly to the xxx branch*.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/sa6tPYh.png
⬥ Navigate back to your Pull Request, and the additional file should be included!

## __Helpful Tips__
.tag:tips
### File Split View
.tag:diffview
⬥ When opening a Pull Request, it is good practice to look at your changes and see if any mistakes have been made.
⬥ By default, you will see differences between your changes and the original file in *Unified View*.
⬥ Sometimes, especially for larger changes, it can be helpful to use *Split View* instead.
⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request, and go to the *Files Changed* tab.
    • By default, you will see unified changes, as shown below:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/KqtUExJ.png
⬥ Click the settings icon, select *Split*, and then *Apply and reload*.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/mqNCNlT.png
⬥ Congratulations! From now on, your changes will be shown in *Split View*.
    • You can reverse the process to go back to a unified view at any time, if you prefer.

.
### Bulk Replacing
⬥ To bulk replace, either navigate to the **Edit** menu then select **Replace in Files** or use the Ctrl+Shift+H keybind to do the same.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/avBqR0i.png
⬥ Doing this will open the **Search/Replace** side menu.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/bLoBXsg.png
⬥ The search box is where you enter what you want to replace and the replace box is where you enter what you want to replace it with.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/1aRteP5.png
⬥ However, most of these results aren't what we're looking for so can be dismissed by hovering over the number to the right and clicking the X to dismiss the whole file or the individual Xs below to dismiss individual matches.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/acVwcaR.png
⬥ When you find something you want to replace. you can either right click and click Replace to do it one at a time or you can click the icon to the left of the X to replace all matches in a file.
