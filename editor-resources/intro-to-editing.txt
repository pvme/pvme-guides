## __Contributing in its Simplest Form__
.tag:intro
Making a post in <#1020853673317908500>. Someone else can see that post and turn it into the edit you want to see added to PvME. For example:
⬥ Pointing out typos/rotation changes in guides
⬥ Writing down strategies for a guide that doesn't exist yet

.
## __The First Steps of Using PvME's Editor Tools__
.tag:EditingTools
These are the most commonly used tools that are used by editors who want to be a bit more involved in making their edits happen:
⬥ <https://pvme.io/guide-editor/>:
    • This is the most important tool editors use. It lets them visualise what the text would look like in discord.
    • Check out <#1250465591085760564> for a tutorial on how to use it, or [a youtube video showing off how easy it is to use](<https://youtu.be/cPWgpRLsqGU>)
    • You can load the guide's text content into the guide editor by using the `/files` command in discord and searching for the guide you want to edit, and clicking on the guide editor link the bot responds with.
⬥ <#771436827214086154>:
    • A simple command `/upload` is all it takes to turn your picture into a usable link.

.
## __What to Edit__
.tag:WhattoEdit
Unsure of how you can contribute? Here's some ideas:
⬥ Check out <#1152990486714388622> and click the `Easy` tag at the top of the page as shown here: https://img.pvme.io/images/Fyfjxwn5W3.png
.
    • That should filter the channel to only show jobs that are deemed as easy and open to everyone who wants to help out.
⬥ Finding mistakes in guides as you are reading them to learn a new pvm information for yourself
