⬥ The **Rotation Builder** is a tool that was developed by <@207588233780002818> to make writing rotations for guides easier.
⬥ Try it for yourself here: **<https://pvme.github.io/rotation-builder/>**

.
> __**Rotation Builder Layout**__
.tag:layout
⬥ When you open the website you'll see the a layout similar to the following.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/bigtPP9.png
⬥ **Input Text** is where your input text goes.
⬥ **Output** is a live output of the emojis from your input text.
⬥ **Copy Options** allow you to copy the text in a couple different output options.
    • **Copy Discord** copies the text as it would be input for a guide in PvME.
    • **Copy Draw.io** copies the raw HTML for import into **draw.io** (a free online tool that helps make flowcharts, diagrams, etc.)

> __**Input Text**__
.tag:input
⬥ When typing the name or alias of an emoji from <#1020845621227307110>, the website will automatically display it as an emoji instead of text.
⬥ For example, typing the raw input text `gbarge → assault → deci → destroy` will yield the following output:

⬥ More examples of how to format input are given on the website.

.
> __**Saving Output**__
.tag:output
⬥ **To save it as an image**: please screenshot *only* the output section.
    • A picture of the rotation looks cleaner and is more easily shared with people than a ton of emoji text IDs.
⬥ **To use emojis directly in a guide**: use the **Copy Discord** button and paste the copied text into your guide.
⬥ Copying the data for draw.io: follow the tutorial given at the bottom of the website.
