## __Github Tutorials__
.tag:tutorials
Find the tutorials, and tips to get started with Github in <#1020841226414604308>.

Don't feel a need to read through all of these, the short tutorial is enough to get started, and then check out others as and when you need them!

.
## __Non-Github Workflow__
.tag:githubnt
If you want to help with guides, but do not want to use Github, follow this short workflow:
⬥ Use /files, and search for the guide you want to edit
    • The guide should open automatically in the guide editor
⬥ Make the edits you want to make
⬥ Click the "export to .txt" button
⬥ Send the file to <#771436827214086154> for editing staff to upload to Github for you
⬥ Done!

.
## __Editing Tools__
.tag:tools
All of our Editing Tools and resources are in <#1020841129064812646>, use <#1153050298978422925> to navigate them easily.

Don't feel a need to read through all of these, just check out what we have available, and look more in depth at tools as and when you need them!

.
## __Points System__
.tag:points
Our points system is fairly subjective and defined by Editing Staff.

Small Jobs (Green) - 1-5 Points (e.g. typo fixes, preset updates, method testing)
Medium Jobs (Amber) - 5-20 Points (e.g. reformatting / writing small guides, updating longer rotations, developing methods)
Large Jobs (Red) - 20+ Points (e.g. making longer guides, updating guides post major meta changes)

Some jobs are not listed as their values will vary wildly, however we do keep note! If you are wondering where you are at, just ask!
