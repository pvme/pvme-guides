> __**Points System**__
.tag:points
Our points system is fairly subjective and defined by Editing Staff.

Small Jobs (Green) - 1-5 Points (e.g. typo fixes, preset updates, method testing)
Medium Jobs (Amber) - 5-20 Points (e.g. reformatting / writing small guides, updating longer rotations, developing methods)
Large Jobs (Red) - 20+ Points (e.g. making longer guides, updating guides post major meta changes)

Some jobs are not listed as their values will vary wildly, however we do keep note! If you are wondering where you are at, just ask!
