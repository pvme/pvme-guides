.tag:definitions
Within these guides there are two levels of AFK you will see mentioned.

**AFK**: These guides will allow you to pay no attention to the game. Times you will need to interact with your character include: to prevent lobbying, drinking potions, collecting loot and placing [Prism of Restoration](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Prism_of_Restoration>) <:prismofrestoration:938475261366784070> to heal familiars if needed.
*These do not require you looking at the RuneScape window and **can** be done using alt1 alerts only.*

**Low Effort**:  These don’t require you actively killing the boss, however may require more effort. This includes: repositioning every kill, banking between kills, moving out of the way of mechanics.
*These require you to be able to see the RuneScape window and **can not** be done with alt1 alerts only.*

    "description": "There are a variety of auras used for AFKing for several reasons. Ensure to follow the guides recomendations however here is some reasoning:\n\n⬥ [Vampyrism](https://runescape.wiki/w/Vampyrism_aura) <:vampaura:643505653079343144> is used for builds revolving around poison, Blood Rever <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> , and for methods which require this extra healing to survive.\n⬥ [Dark Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dark_magic_aura) <:darkmagic:643505652571963417> is the general dps aura for afking. It provides extra hitsplats which synergise with [Soulsplit](https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Split) <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>, and is usually the go to choice.\n⬥ [Mahjarrat](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mahjarrat_aura) <:mahj:643148943856762890> is usually a secondary dps aura choice. It doesnt synergise as well with [Soulsplit](https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Split) <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> however is still a decent dps option.\n⬥ Zerk auras <:mani:643505153709965322> <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:berserker:643505116347105290> are generally to be avoided unless stated otherwise due to increased damage taken.\n⬥ [Penance](https://runescape.wiki/w/Penance_aura) <:penanceaura:643505653062565907> If a method can survive with penance, it will reduce supply usage by 2 [Penance powder](https://runescape.wiki/w/Powder_of_penance) <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226>, with slightly lower kph. This can often result in higher profit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• Use at your own discression."

⬥ Loot Beam
⬥ Inventory Full
⬥ Animate Dead
⬥ Overload
⬥ Weapon Poison
⬥ Summoning Familiar HP Alert
⬥ Kerapac Kill
