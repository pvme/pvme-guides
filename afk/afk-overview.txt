# AFK/Low Effort Overview
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

This channel is intended to be used in addition to the AFK and Low Effort guides. It will provide some assumed unlocks, and setup decisions that are omitted from specific guides to increase readability.

## __Disclaimer__

⬥ **IF YOU CANNOT GET A METHOD TO WORK __DO NOT__ MESSAGE THE CREATOR(S)**
    • It is **more than likely __user error__ or __cutting corners__**, use <#656898197561802760>, and check **this channel** if you cannot get it to work

.
## __Definitions__
.tag:definitions
Within these guides there are two levels of AFK you will see mentioned.

**AFK**: These guides will allow you to pay no attention to the game. Times you will need to interact with your character include: to prevent lobbying, drinking potions, collecting loot and placing [Prism of Restoration](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Prism_of_Restoration>) <:prismofrestoration:938475261366784070> to heal familiars if needed.
*These do not require you looking at the RuneScape window and **can** be done using alt1 alerts only.*

**Low Effort**: These don’t require you actively killing the boss, however may require more effort. This includes: repositioning every kill, banking between kills, moving out of the way of mechanics.
*These require you to be able to see the RuneScape window and **can not** be done with alt1 alerts only.*

## __Aura Choices__

    "title": "__Aura Choices__",
    "color": 39423,
    "description": "There are a variety of auras used for AFKing for several reasons. Ensure to follow the guides recomendations however here is some reasoning:\n\n⬥ [Vampyrism](https://runescape.wiki/w/Vampyrism_aura) <:vampaura:643505653079343144> is used for builds revolving around poison, Blood Rever <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> , and for methods which require this extra healing to survive.\n⬥ [Dark Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dark_magic_aura) <:darkmagic:643505652571963417> is the general dps aura for afking. It provides extra hitsplats which synergise with [Soulsplit](https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Split) <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>, and is usually the go to choice.\n⬥ [Mahjarrat](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mahjarrat_aura) <:mahj:643148943856762890> is usually a secondary dps aura choice. It doesnt synergise as well with [Soulsplit](https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Split) <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> however is still a decent dps option.\n⬥ Zerk auras <:mani:643505153709965322> <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:berserker:643505116347105290> are generally to be avoided unless stated otherwise due to increased damage taken.\n⬥ [Penance](https://runescape.wiki/w/Penance_aura) <:penanceaura:643505653062565907> If a method can survive with penance, it will reduce supply usage by 2 [Penance powder](https://runescape.wiki/w/Powder_of_penance) <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226>, with slightly lower kph. This can often result in higher profit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• Use at your own discression."
