.tag:intro
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on healing through the Twins' damage. It is also important to use the **Animate Dead** spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage to survive some attacks.
⬥ It is assumed that you will use a **Legendary Pet** for this setup. If you choose to forego auto-looting and bring a **Ripper Demon** <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> instead, you can expect 2-3 more kills per hour.
⬥ Even if you have higher tier magic tank armor already perked, it is highly suggested to augment a piece of **Ganodermic Armor** with **Crystal Shield 4** <:crystalshield4:921410343606034443>. Putting the perk on Ganodermic prevents the need to reperk your main armor, and it is very strong in terms of aiding your survival while afking.
⬥ While this does allow for full 5 minute AFKing, sometimes your Legendary Pet will not follow you after Avaryss' charge attack. As such, you may be required to manually loot on some kills if this happens.
⬥ Autocasting Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> with dual-wield magic weapons <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> will be most effective for this setup.

__**Aura Choice**__
.tag:aura
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how fast or consistent can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic is the BIS aura for KPH.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but is not able to be refreshed like Dark Magic.
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing, but nothing else of note.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows a very afk experience, but is rendered obselete by Penance Powder <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226> .

.tag:preset
.img:https://i.imgur.com/fcQ2nW6.png
⬥ <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956> **Magic Tank Armor** - Magic tank armor is required for **Animate Dead** <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, which is needed to mitigate enough damage for this afk method.
    • Cryptbloom is **NOT** required for this method, but full **Ganodermic or better** is required in order to survive mechanics such as Avaryss' Ceiling Collapse attack.
⬥ <:eof:787526151978614824> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and boosted Soulsplit passive.
⬥ <:channellerring:839903943404027914> **Channeller's Ring** - Extra critical chance helps speed up kills.
    • Can be substituted for other strong rings (Asylum Surgeon's <:asr:513190158472839208> or Ring of Death. <:RoD:513190159462825984>)
⬥ <:potionreservoir:878739200407654431> **Potion reservoir** - Can store up to 6 doses of a potion (e.g. overload), and automatically refresh that potion when its duration is low.
⬥ <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226> **Powder of Penance** - Restores prayer points equal to 2.5% of damage taken. Each one lasts for 30 minutes, and completely mitigates the need for prayer potions or the Penance aura.
