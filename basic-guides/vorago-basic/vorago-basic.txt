> __**Vorago Duo Basic Guide - Vitalis**__
.
No Vorago basic guide has been written for Vitalis week because of its difficulty. The aim of the basic guides is to enable players to successfully attain kills with minimal gear, and minimal skill or boss knowledge.

The Vitalis weekly rotation has many aspects to it that make it harder to obtain kills than other weeks, or would require understanding beyond the scope of the basic guides.

Once players have a greater understanding of the boss and effective dps rotations, the main <#1020053121721978880> guide can be used to get a better grasp of the special and how to approach it.
