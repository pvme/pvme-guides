.
### Introduction

This basic guide is designed to streamline players who are starting Vorago duos, and contains some information for Trio, such as the TL5 responsibilities. The strategies in this guide are safe and easy relative to Vorago. With good execution, players following this guide can reach up to 5 kills per hour.

Each weekly rotation can be found as its own thread in the channel. The channel itself contains information related to the current weekly rotation.

### Additional Preset Information
.
⬥ With the use of <:greaterboneshield:1137809118283976814> the preset places <:turtling3:974504834394898522> onto an armour piece.
    • Note: That is greater bone shield, and turtling 3, not their more common counterparts.
⬥ Melee is significantly more challenging than the other combat styles, and is thus omitted.
⬥ The last relic slot does not have a clear "best." Use what you find is most comfortable.
.
### __Misc Important Vorago Facts__
.tag:MiscInfo
⬥ BT refers to Bomb Tank, not Base Tank. Stands furthest away from Vorago to take bombs.
⬥ Base refers to Base tank, stands in melee distance of Vorago and holds aggression during most of the fight.
⬥ TL5 refers to the Top Lure 5.
    • This is a trio+ role.
    • They perform the climb in Phase 1, and take the 5th bleed when applicable during Phase 2 and Phase 4.
⬥ Commonly used abilities/spells unique to Vorago: <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958>, <:cept:543478434509357098>, <:voke:535541259465392143>, <:freedom:535541258240786434>
    • To <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> equip the <:turtling3:974504834394898522> item in your inventory and then cade.
        ⬩ As long as the <:turtling3:974504834394898522> isn't on a weapon/shield, you can switch back immediately.
.
### __Face/Phase 0__
.tag:P0
.
⬥ Vorago deals 70% of your maximum life points upon entry into Phase 1.
⬥ Challenge takes 12s. A bar charges above Vorago's head to indicate when the fight will start.
⬥ Optionally to save on hp, right before the bar fills up, click your <:vitality:654618235097972737>

.
## __Phase 1__
.tag:P1
.
### For Both Players
⬥ Vorago's attack rotation
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/EOpDHbN.png
.
⬥ Three types of auto attack at random: Melee swipe, magic Blue Bomb, or both at the same time
    • Auto attack blue bombs home in on the furthest player from Vorago, deal AoE magic damage, and always hit.
    • Melee swipes deal AoE melee damage around Vorago and around the Base Tank. They can splash.
    • Vorago does not melee swipe if the player with aggro is not in melee distance.
⬥ Red Bomb deals 2000 damage, comes with a non-homing Blue Bomb, clears defensives and puts them on cooldown
    • Thrown at the furthest player similar to Blue Bombs
    • For each player that is close to the bomb tank when the red bomb hits, an additional 1k damage occurs
    • Move at least 4 tiles away from where you were stood to avoid the non-homing blue.
⬥ The phase can only end when someone has successfully jumped on Vorago to release the piece of the Maul of Omens.
    • If Vorago's hp goes under about 13k before this, his HP will "reset" somewhere between 80-100k
.
### Base Tank
⬥ Prioritise tagging Vorago ASAP.
    • If Trio, <:voke:535541259465392143> as you tag.
⬥ Bring Vorago to the east of the red line in the image below. Once he is there use your main damaging abilities <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> / <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455>
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/yhVlG5p6no.png
.
⬥ Expect a few blue bombs. Prayer flick and use defensives as necessary. <:res:535541258844635148> provides a big heal.
⬥ Once the BT has voked, stand directly south of the middle of Vorago and voke back at around 50k HP left.
.
### Top Lure (The Bomb Tank in duo)
⬥ Climb speed is paramount to survival
    • Less damage is taken by you and your base on faster climbs.
    • Use surge and dive as frequently as possible.
.
⬥ <:voke:535541259465392143> Vorago from two north and two west of the jump spot and do not move until Vorago has finished moving.
    • There is no leniency on what tile to stand on for this mechanic. If you mess up, the base must revoke vorago to the east and you must try again.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/gXlab4c.png
.
⬥  Once Vorago stops moving, do a basic DPS rotation
⬥  You must have at least one inventory space free for the Maul of Omens piece to be able to jump.
⬥  Jump at <50k HP. Make sure to be high/full HP.
⬥ Food cannot be eaten during climb animations, but bombs can continue to land and stack damage upon animation finish. Make sure to maintain high HP.
    • Do not risk death trying to save food. It is expected to use some this phase.

.
## __Phase 2__
.tag:P2
### For Both Players
⬥ Vorago's attack rotation:
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/pPNE2a2.png
.
⬥ Phase 2 is largely time gated. Focus on mechanics.
    • One gravity orb spawns every reflect. Two are needed to progress. Missing orbs will result in additional cycles.
⬥ Use defensives to avoid food usage.
⬥ More advanced Vorago guides will minimise Vorago's movement on this phase, but while learning the focus should be on surviving and dealing with mechanics properly.
⬥ Vorago's Bleeds break defensives (i.e. take them off. So if you have resonance / cade up, it will remove them + you will receive damage.)
    • Appears as <:dismember:535532879376023572> on debuff bar
    • First bleed of the phase has no animation; it occurs during Vorago's spawning animation.
⬥ Reflect (Link)
    • **DO NOT ATTACK ON REFLECT**
    • Vorago is immune to damage during this time
    • Damage dealt to Vorago instead goes to someone on the team
⬥ Spam click Vorago during Bring Him Down (BHD), then deal damage to free the maul piece.
    • BHD damage threshold is a collective 50k.
    • Use high damaging thresholds, but refrain from using <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> / <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> as you will want them for next phase.
.
### Base Tank
⬥ Clear the first two bleeds with <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:escape:535541258832052231>
    • Use <:voke:535541259465392143> between the first and second bleeds to ensure aggro for the second bleed
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/u56A12qwwv.mp4
.
⬥ You will tank the blue bomb that comes with the third bleed. <:res:535541258844635148> is recommended.
⬥ <:voke:535541259465392143> Vorago after the fifth bleed.
⬥ It is recommended to <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> + <:cept:543478434509357098> the BT on red bomb release.
.
### Bomb Tank
⬥ Use <:voke:535541259465392143> after the second bleed.
⬥ <:freedom:535541258240786434> the third, <:escape:535541258832052231> the fourth, and stand still for the fifth. The Base Tank will <:voke:535541259465392143> and lure the boss away to clear the fifth bleed.
    • You will likely take at least one hit of bleed damage on the 5th bleed while learning.
⬥ Use any number of defensives against the Blue Bombs.
.
### TL5 (if trio+)
⬥ Use <:voke:535541259465392143> after the fourth bleed.
⬥ Use <:freedom:535541258240786434> to clear the 5th bleed when it is applied.
⬥ Step back out of melee distance after the Base vokes Vorago.
⬥ Tag red gravity orbs when they spawn.

Follow the arms or be smacked for 2.5k.\n⬥ Quadrants 2-4 contain bombs, with heavy damage reduction depending on the bomb:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• In the Blue Bomb quadrant, Vorago takes 1/2 damage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• In the Red Bomb Quadrant, Vorago takes 1/3 damage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0• In the Purple Bomb Quadrant, Vorago takes 1/4 damage.\n⬥ After the last quadrant, Vorago stands up and releases all untagged bombs, in addition to Vorago's normal auto attacks."

.embed:json
### For Both Players
⬥ Vorago's attack rotation:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/thsFIBw.png
⬥ The End
⬥ One person tags all Blue Bombs, while the other person uses <:devo:513190158728953857> + <:Cept:543478434509357098>
    • Tagging Blue Bombs resets <:devo:513190158728953857> + puts it on cooldown. This is a two person job.
    • Bomb tag and <:devo:513190158728953857> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> can be done by either player. Sort this out in advance.
    • Using <:Cept:543478434509357098> slightly early is advised. Intercept will sometimes fail while your character is moving and can cause you to pk your partner.
⬥ <:vitality:654618235097972737> when bombs are released after Vorago stands up.
⬥ Stop attacking after the purple bomb explodes (for the reflect mechanic).

.
### Base Tank
⬥ When Vorago stands up, <:voke:535541259465392143> + stand melee distance to reduce damage taken by the BT.
    • Note that this is done if you <:devo:513190158728953857> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> for the blue bombs during the mechanic.
        ⬩ If you do not, the Base will take blue bombs + melee swipes and it can be painful.

.
### Bomb Tank
⬥ When Vorago stands up, make sure to be far away from Vorago.

.
### Suggested Rotations (Both Players)
⬥ If using necro, <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> while going to first quadrant and <:splitsoul:1137809168368148490> before he puts his arms down
⬥ Thresh and apply affinity debuffs in the first quadrant (no damage reduction)
⬥ Use basics to prepare for bomb tag during the second or third quadrant.
⬥ <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> at the end of the third quadrant
    • Move back into ultimate after the fourth quadrant and prepare to do damage when Vorago stands.
⬥ Ditch ultimates for second set of arms if necessary. Try to finish the phase with thresholds.
⬥ If a second stand is expected, players should switch roles for the tag + cepting of blue bombs if needed.

.
## __Phase 4__
.tag:P4
### For Both Players
⬥ Vorago's attack rotation:
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/REPpAAF.png
.
⬥ Phase 4 is time gated. Focus on mechanics.
    • 3 Waterfalls are required to progress the phase. Lower Vorago's HP to under 30k before the last Waterfall.
⬥ Waterfall
    • Spawns in one of the four corners. Run behind it quickly, or take up to 10k damage.
    • Some tiles look safe but are not. If unsure, run all the way into the corner.
    • Clears active defensives and puts them on cooldown.
⬥ Clone skip
    • Massive time save if done both times
    • See role sections below for each player's responsibilities
⬥ The End
    • Same mechanic as Phase 3, except:
        ⬩ After Vorago stands up, there are 3 auto attacks then his Red Bomb.
        ⬩ After the Red bomb, Vorago will use 4 auto attacks before reflect.
        ⬩ <:cade:535541306353778689> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> strategies are used to handle the bombs instead of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> potion
        ⬩ Do not use <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> as it extends the cooldown for too long to be used twice on this phase
.
### Base Tank
⬥ Clone skip
    • Base Tank walks Vorago to the wall
        ⬩ Turn run off, spam click Vorago + surge out of the Waterfall, <:voke:535541259465392143>, walk under Vorago, click near the wall in the direction that Vorago walks
    • The BT may be out of bomb range, which means any potential bombs go to the Base Tank instead.
        ⬩ Eat to high HP in the Waterfall, prayer flick <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> for Blue Bombs, and use <:res:535541258844635148> / <:reflect:535541258786177064> as needed.
        ⬩ ⬥ After the skip, Vorago goes straight into The End (Purple Bomb) special.
⬥ Build adrenaline throughout the arms animation
⬥ Tag red bombs in their quadrant. The Bomb Tank should use <:cade:535541306353778689> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> on you for this.
⬥ Red bombs drain adrenaline, ensure that you have 100% by Vorago's stand.
⬥ When Vorago stands up, use <:cade:535541306353778689> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> on the Bomb Tank. Re-cept when cade timer has 10s left.
.
### Bomb Tank
⬥ Clone skip
    • Surge to the wall opposite of Vorago
        ⬩ Move in when Vorago does the clone animation (fake melee swipe)
⬥ If Clone Skip fails, BT should use <:devo:513190158728953857> against the Blue Bombs.
⬥ After the skip, Vorago goes straight into The End (Purple Bomb) special.
⬥ In the quadrant with Red Bombs, use <:cade:535541306353778689> + <:Cept:543478434509357098> on the Base Tank while they tag Red Bombs.
.
### TL5 (if trio+)
⬥ Clone skip
    • Surge to the wall opposite of Vorago
        ⬩ Move in when Vorago does the clone animation (fake melee swipe)
⬥ Use <:voke:535541259465392143> after the fourth bleed.
⬥ Use <:freedom:535541258240786434> to clear the 5th bleed when it is applied.
⬥ Step back out of melee distance after the Base vokes Vorago.

.
## __Phase 5__
.tag:P5
### For Both Players
⬥ Vorago's attack rotation:
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/gg1VugJ.png
.
⬥ Reverse tug-of-war mechanic
    • 20k damage against Vorago pushes him east 1 square
    • Each tick of damage received from Vorago he pushes west 1 square
    • Any damage mitigated from <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> negates any pushback
    • Push Vorago all the way to the east, move melee distance, and click the Maul of Omens
.
⬥ PB
    • Vorago turns all players into explosive Vitali, with a timer above their head.
    • When timer hits 0, a purple bomb explodes on the player. This is AoE, so avoid standing near your partner.
    • Vorago will do 5 auto attacks before reflect.
    • Standing on opposite walls largely allows you to ignore this special.
.
⬥ Base Tank hugs the South wall, while Bomb Tank hugs the North wall. Players should only move away from their respective walls to clear Vorago's bleeds.

⬥ Bleeds
    • 3 bleeds with that are randomly assigned
    • Vorago does not throw blue bombs during bleeds.
    • Taking damage from bleeds results in Vorago pushing further west. Prioritise clearing them over DPS.
    • Bleeds are cleared by distance from the tile the bleed was received, not distance from Vorago in this phase.
    • Move melee distance + go to the center of the arena. That way you can properly <:escape:535541258832052231> to remove bleeds
    • The safest way to clear bleeds in case you get all 3 is to <:escape:535541258832052231>  the first bleed and then run back melee distance, <:freedom:535541258240786434> second bleed. <:escape:535541258832052231> the third bleed.
.
### Suggested Rotations (Base Tank)
⬥ Use <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> / <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> in melee distance
⬥ If you do not get the kill before the bleeds end, you will swap into the bomb tanking role
    • Use <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> to tank the blue bombs during the purple bomb special.
.
### Suggested Rotations (Bomb Tank)
⬥ Use a threshold → basics to 100% → <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> when the first Blue Bomb lands.
⬥ If you do not get the kill before the bleeds end, you will swap into the base tanking role
    • Build to 100% and <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> / <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> in melee distance ASAP
