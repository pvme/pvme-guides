A being of pure chaos that resides to the west of the Rogues' Castle located in deep Wilderness. The Chaos Elemental is a beginner-friendly boss with simple mechanics meant to disorient the player more than harm them.

## __How to Get There__
.tag:location
**WARNING: THIS BOSS IS LOCATED IN THE WILDERNESS, BE SURE TO HAVE PVP TOGGLED *OFF* BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FIGHT IT.**

⬥ The level 50 Wilderness Obelisk is located east of the Chaos Elemental, easily accessed with the Portable Obelisk <:portableobelisk:1137735861937655900>, Obelisk Shards, or any of the other Wilderness Obelisks.
    • These options will teleport the player to a random Wilderness Obelisk unless they have the hard Wilderness area tasks completed.
⬥ The teleport levers located in Edgeville <:edgevillelode:1032552323903402024> and Ardougne <:ardougnelode:1032552315724517507> teleport the player to the Deserted Keep, located west of the Chaos Elemental.

⬥ Summer Pies are used due to them leaving a Pie Dish in the player's inventory, keeping it full to avoid the Chaos Elemental's Madness attack.

## __Tips and Tricks__
.tag:tips
⬥ The <:magic:689504724159823906> hit of Discord is the most accurate, making it best to either Protect from Magic <:protectfrommagic:1052551456835768351> or Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> throughout the fight.
⬥ Prioritize using powerful threshold abilities, only using basic abilities to build up to stronger ones, or when better options are on cooldown.
    • For Ranged <:range:580168050121113623> examples of powerful abilities are Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, with abilities like Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> and Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> being your weaker basics. Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> is a very powerful ability, but should only be used near the start of the fight, if you find yourself with *too much* adrenaline.
    • For Necromancy <:necromancy:1148995625896120460> build up to abilities like Volley of Souls <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> and Finger of Death <:fingerofdeath:1159434801938432010> with your weaker abilities, Soul Sap <:soulsap:1137809140476031057> and Touch of Death <:touchofdeath:1137809175980810380>, using your Basic Attack <:necroauto:1137809137401602109> when all else is on cooldown.
⬥ If possible, keep your inventory full of items to avoid the Madness special attack, Chaos Elemental's drops can be used to fill any blank spaces.
⬥ An NPC named Edward, located outside the Dragonkin Laboratory, south-east of the level 50 Wilderness Obelisk, can be used as a bank to store any drops the player receives and resupply for longer trips.
⬥ Due to the Chaos Elemental being located in the Wilderness, all Wilderness based bonuses granted by the Infernal Puzzle Box <:infernalpuzzlebox:994189299681607800> work against this boss.
