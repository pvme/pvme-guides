⬥ **Charge Pads**
    • The arena has 6 pads that you can stand on to charge.
    • When it is full charged, Zamorak will stop attacking for a while and your adrenaline bar will be refilled. After this, you will gain an **Edict** while Zamorak gains a **Hex** depending on the pad charged.
    • You will become unable to charge pads when Zamorak says **`HEED MY CALL`**. To continue charging the next pad, you must enter Infernus and kill the mage present.
        ⬩ This happens after charging every pad.

*Notes: Once **Chaos Traps** have been activated, <:anti:535541306475151390> and <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> before stepping on other pads. Additionally, once the bar for charging a rune is full, move at least 3 squares away from the middle of the rune. If **Coven** is not your last rune, be prepared to kill a Healer and Protector.*
