        "name": "__Pads__",
        "value": "Solak will spawn 1 green pad for each player in the battle at random locations. Players must each stand on a pad by the time the falling spore reaches the ground or all players will be dealt 5-6k blight damage per pad missed. Use movement based abilities (<:surge:535533810004262912> and <:bd:535532854281764884>) to quickly make it to a pad"

        "name": "__Personal Blight Bomb__",
        "value": "After pads, all players will have a bar above their head - this is a hard typeless blight bomb that will hit 8-10k if not handled correctly. Use <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148> as the bar fills entirely to negate the damage. Note that proximity to the boss will affect when you are hit by an auto attack which will change the timing of your <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148>."

If these aren't killed by around 1:30, they will animate into Blightbound Lashers that deal heavy range damage and heal each other."

      {
        "name": "__Personal Roots__",
        "value": "At 1:06, Solak will choose 2 random players to be targeted by this mechanic. Each affected player will be given a text box informing that they have Blight Roots as well as a timer that counts down. There will also be yellow arrows at the players' feet, on the minimap, and on the arena itself indicating the location that the roots will be coming from. When the timer reaches 0, the roots will pinpoint the players' location and launch towards them, from the yellow arrow, to the pinpointed location. The player must move 1 or more tiles away from the pinpointed location and away from the area of the roots to avoid damage and a stun. It is best to <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the timer reaches 0 to ensure that, even if you are hit, you will not be stunned."

        "name": "__AoE Blight Bomb__",
        "value": "At 1:32 and 1:49 (and throughout Phase 3, as well), up to 3 non-base roles will receive a bar above their head which will explode for 3.5-4k when the bar fills. These bombs are AoE. <:res:535541258844635148> can be used for a heal. Alternatively, <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, <:debil:535541278264393729>, or simply tank it."

        "value": "At 1:55 (1:06 for rootskips, 1:32 and 1:49 respectively for bomb skips), Solak will stop attacking and teleport to the center of the arena with his arms rooted to the ground. Arms must be killed within 30 seconds or Solak will stand back up and spawn Blightbound Lashers.  After both arms die, Solak will stand up allowing his legs to be attacked. You have 20 seconds to kill these or, like the arms, Solak will stand up and spawn Blightbound Lashers."
      },
      {
        "name": "__Core__",
        "value": "After both the arms and legs have been killed, Solak will expose his core. The core has 125,000 hp per person in the fight and the team will have 18 seconds to damage it before Solak stands up and repeats Phase 1 mechanics until he is phased. Once the core is dead, Phase 1 ends and Phase 2 begins."
