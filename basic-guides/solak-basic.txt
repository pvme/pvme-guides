.tag:preset
This will eventually have a preset!

.
> **__Phase One Mechanics__**
.tag:p1
**__Pads__**
⬥ One green pad for each player in the battle will spawn at a random location
    • Use <:surge:535533810004262912> / <:bd:535532854281764884> to stand on a pad before the falling spore hits the ground
    • Players will be dealt 5-6k blight damage per pad missed

.
**__Personal Blight Bomb__**
⬥ After pads, all players will have a bar above their head
    • Use <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148> as the bar fills entirely to negate the 9-10k damage
    • Proximity to Solak will affect when you are hit by an auto attack, which will change the timing of your <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:res:535541258844635148>

.
**__Volatile Rootlings__**
⬥ At 0:21, 8 volatile rootlings appear around the edges of the arena
    • Rootlings have 20,000 hp in a duo and gain 12,500 hp for every additional player in the fight
    • If not killed by around 1:30, they will become Blightbound Lashers, dealing heavy range damage and healing

.
**__Personal Roots__**
⬥ At 1:06, 2 random players will be given a text box informing that they have Blight Roots as well as a timer that counts down
    • There will be yellow arrows at the players' feet, on the minimap, and on the arena itself indicating where the roots will be coming from
    • When the timer hits 0, the roots will launch towards the players' location in a triangle shape
    • The player must move 1 or more tiles away from their pinpointed location and away from the roots to avoid damage and a stun
        - <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the timer reaches 0 to ensure you won't be stunned

.
**__AoE Blight Bomb__**
⬥ At 1:32 and 1:49 (and throughout Phase 3, as well), up to 3 non-base roles will receive a bar above their head
    • When filled entirely, an explosion will deal 3-4k damage (AoE)
    • <:res:535541258844635148> can be used for a heal
        - Alternatively, <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, <:debil:535541278264393729>, or tank it

.
**__Arms and Legs__**
⬥ At 1:55 (1:06 for rootskips, 1:32 and 1:49 respectively for bomb skips), Solak will root his arms to the center of the arena
    • Arms must be killed within 30 seconds
    • After both arms die, Solak will stand up, exposing his legs. Legs must be killed within 20 seconds
    • Being too slow on either arms or legs means that Solak will stand up and spawn Blightbound Lashers

.
**__Core__**
⬥ After both the arms and legs have been killed, Solak will expose his core
    • The core has 125,000 hp per person, and is exposed for 18 seconds
    • If the core is not finished within this time, P1 mechanics will repeat
    • Once the core is dead, Phase 1 ends and Phase 2 begins

.
> **__Phase Two Mechanics__**
.tag:p2
**__Eruptions__**
⬥ At the start of Phase 2, an eruption will spawn in each corner of the arena
    • When killed, these eruptions will spawn a blue circle that will teleport everyone within up to the Anima Storm 5 seconds after the eruption dies

.
**__Anima Storm__**
⬥ Persists from the beginning of Phase 2 until it is killed
    • Every 10 seconds, it will drop blight rain onto the arena hitting all players for 2k damage and will add a blight stack to the player's debuffs
    • It is destroyed by teleporting via the eruptions and spam clicking the storm in the sky
    • As the storm "rains" down onto the arena, a puddle of blight rain will begin to form in the center
        - Stay away from the puddle as it hits for almost 2k damage per tick and will add a blight stack for each hit
        - While in the sky, players can position themselves away from the center to ensure they return to the ground outside of the puddle

.
**__Cleanse/Blight Stacks__**
⬥ In Phases 2 and 3, Merethiel can be clicked to activate a green circle on the ground at the south
    • Blight Stacks appear on the players' debuff bars
    • It will remove all blight stacks from players standing within it
        - Players will do 1000 less damage per click to the Anima Storm per stack, and receive 1% more damage

.
**__Blight Spores__**
⬥ 6 auto attacks after all eruptions die, Blight Spore bombs will spawn all around the arena
    • Spores will rise into the air, fall back to the ground, and explode
    • The longer the mechanic has progressed, the more damage they will deal
        - Towards the end of the mechanic, they will hit up to 8k and should be avoided at all costs

.
**__Anima Rain__**
⬥ 12 auto attacks after spores, five hits of Anima Rain will fall from the sky
    • Players should click the golden sphere in the north to consume the Blessing of Nature
    • Immediately before the first rain, players should press their extra action button to deploy the blessing
        - The Blessing of Nature shield dome lowers the Anima Rain damage by 75%
    • Players can run outside of the shield and use <:res:535541258844635148> for a heal

.
**__Arm Climb__**
⬥ 12 auto attacks after the last Anima Rain, Solak will pull and root one player to the ground
    • The player should <:freedom:535541258240786434> from the roots and move away
        - Failure to do so will result in being insta-killed
    • After Solak slams his arm, a player should click the arm to climb up
        - This will deal a deadly blow will to Solak
    • After the climb, Solak will hit the climber with a massive melee hit, up to 9k
        - Climber should <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:res:535541258844635148> this hit
