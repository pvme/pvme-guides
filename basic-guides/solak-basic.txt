.
> **__Phase One Mechanics__**
.tag:p1
**__Pads__**
⬥ One green pad for each player in the battle will spawn at a random location
    • Use <:surge:535533810004262912> / <:bd:535532854281764884> to stand on a pad before the falling spore hits the ground
    • Players will be dealt 5-6k blight damage per pad missed
    • A Powerburst of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> can be used to survive missing (or skipping) pads
        - <:debil:535541278264393729> will also be required to survive skipping pads in larger groups

.
**__Personal Blight Bomb__**
⬥ After pads, all players will have a bar above their head
    • Use <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148> as the bar fills entirely to negate the 9-10k damage
    • Proximity to Solak will affect when you are hit by an auto attack, which will change the timing of your <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:res:535541258844635148>

.
**__Volatile Rootlings__**
⬥ At 0:21, 8 Volatile Rootlings <:roots:848803062684581929> appear around the edges of the arena
    • It is recommended for each player to pre-place a set of two <:dommine:662249620579155968> underneath rootling spawn points before starting the fight
        - Both <:dommine:662249620579155968> should be placed same-tick
        - A second set of two <:dommine:662249620579155968> can be placed while killing the remaining rootlings
    • Rootlings have 20,000 hp in a duo and gain 12,500 hp for every additional player in the fight
    • If not killed by around 1:30, they will become Blightbound Lashers <:blightlasher:581180203062001664>
        - Lashers will attack with <:range:580168050121113623> and can deal heavy damage
        - If two consecutive rootlings turn into Lashers, the second will heal to full

.
**__Personal Roots__**
⬥ At 1:06, 2 random players will be given a text box informing that they have Blight Roots as well as a timer that counts down
    • There will be yellow arrows at the players' feet, on the minimap, and on the arena itself indicating where the roots will be coming from
    • When the timer hits 0, the roots will launch towards the players' location in a triangle shape
    • The player must move 1 or more tiles away from their pinpointed location and away from the roots to avoid damage and a stun
        - <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the timer reaches 0 to ensure you won't be stunned

.
**__AoE Blight Bomb__**
⬥ At 1:32 and 1:49 (and throughout Phase 3, as well), up to 3 non-base roles will receive a bar above their head
    • When filled entirely, an explosion will deal 3-4k damage (AoE)
    • <:res:535541258844635148> can be used for a heal
        - Alternatively, <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, <:debil:535541278264393729>, or tank it
    • Solak's auto attacks will speed up after these bombs

.
**__Arms and Legs__**
⬥ At 1:55 (1:06 for rootskips, 1:32 and 1:49 respectively for bomb skips), Solak will root his arms to the center of the arena
    • Arms must be killed within 30 seconds
    • After both arms die, Solak will stand up, exposing his legs. Legs must be killed within 20 seconds
    • Being too slow on either arms or legs means that Solak will stand up and spawn Blightbound Lashers <:blightlasher:581180203062001664>

.
**__Core__**
⬥ After both the arms and legs have been killed, Solak will expose his core
    • The core has 125,000 hp per person, and is exposed for 18 seconds
    • If the core is not finished within this time, P1 mechanics will repeat
    • Once the core is dead, Phase 1 ends and Phase 2 begins

.
> **__Phase Two Mechanics__**
.tag:p2
**__Eruptions__**
⬥ At the start of Phase 2, an eruption will spawn in each corner of the arena
    • When killed, these eruptions will spawn a blue circle that will teleport everyone within up to the Anima Storm 5 seconds after the eruption dies

.
**__Anima Storm__**
⬥ Persists from the beginning of Phase 2 until it is killed
    • Every 10 seconds, it will drop blight rain onto the arena hitting all players for 2k damage and will add a Blight Stack <:blight:851514430613487686> to the player's debuffs
    • It is destroyed by teleporting via the eruptions and spam clicking the storm in the sky
    • As the storm "rains" down onto the arena, a puddle of blight rain will begin to form in the center
        - Stay away from the puddle as it hits for almost 2k damage per tick and will add a Blight Stack <:blight:851514430613487686> for each hit
        - While in the sky, players can position themselves away from the center to ensure they return to the ground outside of the puddle

.
**__Cleanse/Blight Stacks__**
⬥ In Phases 2 and 3, Merethiel can be clicked to activate a green circle on the ground at the south
    • Blight Stacks <:blight:851514430613487686> appear on the players' debuff bars
    • It will remove all blight stacks from players standing within it
        - Players will do 1000 less damage per click to the Anima Storm per stack, and receive 1% more damage

.
**__Blight Spores__**
⬥ 6 auto attacks after all eruptions die, Blight Spore bombs will spawn all around the arena
    • Spores will rise into the air, fall back to the ground, and explode
    • The longer the mechanic has progressed, the more damage they will deal
        - Towards the end of the mechanic, they will hit up to 8k and should be avoided at all costs

.
**__Anima Rain__**
⬥ 12 auto attacks after spores, five hits of Anima Rain will fall from the sky
    • Players should click the golden sphere in the north to consume the Blessing of Nature
    • Immediately before the first rain, players should press their extra action button to deploy the blessing
        - The Blessing of Nature shield dome lowers the Anima Rain damage by 75%
    • Players can run outside of the shield and use <:res:535541258844635148> for a heal

.
**__Arm Climb__**
⬥ 2 auto attacks after the last Anima Rain, Solak will pull and root one player to the ground
    • The player should <:freedom:535541258240786434> from the roots and move away
        - Failure to do so will result in being insta-killed
    • After Solak slams his arm, a player should click the arm to climb up
        - This will deal a deadly blow to Solak
    • After the climb, Solak will hit the climber with a massive melee hit, up to 9k
        - Climber should <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:res:535541258844635148> this hit

.
> **__Phase Three Mechanics__**
.tag:p3
**__Charge Pads__**
⬥ At the start of Phase 3, 8 pads will spawn around the arena
    • As Solak stands on this pad, it will charge up (indicated by a blue ring)
        - It takes 15 seconds for a pad to become fully charged
    • When fully charged, Solak will stop attacking and begin to shake rapidly for 12 seconds
        - This makes for a good time to heal with <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>
    • Random bombs can fall onto pads throughout the phase, tank, move away, or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:res:535541258844635148>
    • During this 12 second window, players may use their extra action button to access the Realm
    • If all 8 pads are fully charged, P3 will end
        - This is not commonly done; instead, it is recommended to enter the realm and kill Erethdor

.
**__The Realm__**
⬥ Accessed on Phases 3 and 4 by using the extra action button
    • If clicked during P3, the player will be in the Realm for 20 seconds before returning to the regular arena
    • When in the Realm, food cannot heal you, but other sources of healing still work (e.g. excalibur)
    • In Phase 3, the Realm is used to kill Erethdor ("the Elf")
        - The phase will end when Erethdor is killed

.
**__AoE Blight Bomb & Stun__**
⬥ AoE blight bombs also occur in Phase 3, and are dealt with the same as in Phase 1
⬥ Throughout the phase, Solak will stun all players in the regular arena
    • If he is not stunned back, players will be hit with a bleed that escalates in damage over time
        - Weapons with Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> will still work for this mechanic

.
> **__Phase Four Mechanics__**
.tag:p4
**__Realm Manifestations__**
⬥ Entering the Realm on P4 should not be done under normal circumstances, instead, prefer to No-Realm
⬥ Manifestations will spawn inside of the Realm and attempt to consume Solak's mind
    • If the mind is consumed, all players will be insta-killed
    • The HP of Solak's mind is the bottom of the two displayed on-screen
    • The rate at which manifestations consume the mind increases the longer they live
    • More manifestations will spawn the faster Solak's HP bar is depleted
        - This means delaying the use of some high damage abilities can be useful
⬥ Manifestations can be tanked by a player through entering the Realm
    • Manifestations attack with <:Magic:689504724159823906>
    • While in the Realm, players can sacrifice their own HP to heal Solak's mind
        - This should be done by first using <:cade:535541306353778689> and then clicking Solak

.
**__Burst of Nature__**
⬥ Appears as a purple tornado surrounding Solak
    • Deals a large hit every ~28 seconds
        - Damage can be lowered tremendously by using stunning abilities
        - <:impact:535533809655873556> / <:deep:535533833139912724> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> / <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> / <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> / <:tight:535541275957657600> will still reduce damage even with <:flank4:712073088296157185>

.
**__The No-Realm__**
⬥ The general approach to succeeding on P4 is to ignore the Realm, and instead finish Solak before his mind is consumed
    • Enter the phase with a fairly high level of adrenaline
    • Build up to 100%, and wait for Solak to rush forward, and then be pulled backwards
        - You can build on Solak before the pull-back, but he will be immune to damage
    • Execute a strong ultimate ability rotation after Solak is pulled back
    • Stunning abilities should be used early to reduce Burst of Nature damage
