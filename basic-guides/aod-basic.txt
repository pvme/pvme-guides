.
## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
The aim of this guide is provide a basic overview of how to get consistent kills at Nex: Angel of Death with a low-tier geared team. While writing this guide, we aimed to keep each preset within the confines of tier 1 of <#1020045708746833930>. However due to the endgame nature of the boss, this has not been totally possible. Keeping this in mind, we have instead aimed to provide presets that are as low-tiered as possible without consistent strategies becoming unviable.

### Disclaimer
This guide is made with the idea of getting started at AoD, and does not cover meta strategies. For those please refer to the main guides in <#1020025399079600178>. For a detailed description of mechanics, please refer to <#1020818825840689262>.

## __Range <:range:580168050121113623>__
.tag:range
Ranged is the most expensive style to use at AoD even at an entry level due to <:grico:787904334812807238>. While making this guide we considered the possibility of excluding the ability. Unfortunately, this was not possible as minion tanking with range simply becomes unviable if you do not have it.
.
Chinning is possible without <:grico:787904334812807238>, however since we included it for range minion tank we also decided to include it for all roles using the ranged combat style.
