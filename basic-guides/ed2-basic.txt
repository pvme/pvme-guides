ED2 is considered the most beginner friendly Elite Dungeon. The requirements to feasibly solo it both in terms of gear and skill are generally considered low. However, it still has considerable amount of challenging components which can result in fast KOs if the player is not careful.

.
⬥ Mechanics with high KO potential include but are not limited to:
    • Astellarn's neutron star
    • Astellarn's black hole combined with celestial rain
    • Verak Lith's fire tornados
    • Verak Lith's egg bomb
    • Black Stone Dragon's purple smoke/fire
    • Black Stone Dragon's ability to attack semi-randomly using all 3 styles
    • Black hands' heavy magic autos and small shadow hands

⬥ Use zerker aura <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:mani:643505153709965322> variants for the dungeon. Otherwise, <:vamp:643505653079343144> is fine for learning.

⬥ <:Magic:689504724159823906> and <:Ranged:689504724403486920> are used for this guide as <:melee:615612332521029632> is by far the least beginner friendly style to use in ED2.

The first boss you encounter. The boss has many mechanics that deal typeless damage so be prepared to eat. It uses hard hitting but slow auto attacks in all 3 styles, but primarily uses a <:Magic:689504724159823906> breath attack which is very easy to flick.

__**Astellarn, the First Celestial (Fight tips)**__

⬥ Do not use your damage boosting ultimates <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868>, but instead igneous abilities <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386> <:tsunamiincite:958989794757730307> and powerful thresholds for the first 50k HP.
    • Use <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> after dropping the wyrmhole as you will deal most of your damage after luring the neutron star.

⬥ Stand out of her melee range so you only have to flick <:Magic:689504724159823906> autos.

⬥ It is recommended to drop the wyrmhole between Astellarn and the west wall:
.

.
⬥ Keep hitting Astellarn before the Neutron Star spawns to build adren and as poison damage is unaffected by her damage reduction.

⬥ You can <:res:535541258844635148> or <:divert:787904334377648130> after using <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> while waiting for the Neutron Star to spawn.

⬥ If you fail to lure the Neutron Star into the Wyrmhole, teleport out and restart the fight.

__**Blackstone dragon (Fight tips)**__
.tag:bsdtips
⬥ Because her <:Magic:689504724159823906> autos are slow while her <:melee:615612332521029632> autos are fast, sometimes the hits can land at the same time and stack you out, you may use <:res:535541258844635148> or <:debil:535541278264393729> if you see this coming.

⬥ Rotation Outline:
    • <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> at the start of the fight, and then whenver it comes back up until BSD flies.
    • <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> on BSD again after flight and finish her off with powerful thresholds and abilities.

.
⬥ Black hands
    • <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> at the safespots during Black Hands to eliminate the need to move to avoid the small hands.
    • The default <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> option will help with applying <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> to Black Hands greatly.
    • Clear 2 Black Hands and then <:surge:535533810004262912> to the safespot between the other pair. <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> once it comes off cooldown and finish off the other pair of hands.
        - You may want to <:res:535541258844635148> some hits from Black Hands.
    • Use <:dommine:662249620579155968> as often as you can on hands. Pay attention to when they come off cooldown.

.
⬥ Flight phase
    • If using <:Magic:689504724159823906>, be sure to build or sustain <:incitefear:856635090783567902> or/and <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> stacks.
    • Don't stay on low health during flight to avoid randomly dying to smoke.
    • Remember to refresh <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> after BSD completes her flight phase.
    • Be ready to move from where you cast <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> to avoid smoke.

__**Mobs and movement**__
.tag:mobs
Mob clearing in ED2 is arguably the most tricky to do properly amongst the trilogy. There are various portions of the dungeon where you can be subjected to many sources of damage. Thus, using powerful abilties to clear and moving fast from place to place will benefit you greatly.

⬥ You may find yourself eating a lot of damage from Lava Spiders and Labratory Slimes.
    • Clear any slimes that harass you or get them stuck behind this Celestial Dragon before Astellarn like so:

.
    • Lava Spiders after Astellarn will naturally get stuck behind Lava Strykes when you proceed to the Verak Lith boss fight:

    • You can also teleport out at any time and re-enter the dungeon to despawn any non-essential mobs that are following you around.
