> __**Overview of the Fight**__
.tag:overview
⬥ The fight begins by clearing airuts and chargers.
    • Beware of Airuts' punishing melee attacks.
⬥ When the mob counter reaches 22 the first pet, Cormes, will spawn beside the western gong.
    • Stand slightly SE of this gong and attack the pet.
    • Protect melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if attacked by melee airuts, or step away and <:devo:513190158728953857>.
⬥ Kill airuts and chargers until the countdown reaches 0.
⬥ At this point, team members should position themselves near the centre of the arena.
    • Base lures BM to the SE corner.
    • Pet Tank 2 provokes the pet ensuring it faces away from the team.
    • NC and BUSC clear chargers lining the arena perimiter.
⬥ The DPS attack Pet 2 until it reaches 100k health.
    • They should then switch to Pet 3, attacking until it reaches ~100k lifepoints.
⬥ Kill pets when BM is almost 750k LP. If BM still has high health (~900k), lower BM's lifepoints to 750k before finally killing the pets.
⬥ Once pets die, focus on BM.

⬥ Pets are split between two players: Pet Tank 1/3 and Pet Tank 2
    • The numbers refer to the respective order in which the pets spawn.
    • The first pet is always Cormes, the second pet can be either Tuz or Krar.
⬥ For Cormes, stand north of the western gong and <:voke:535541259465392143> as soon as it spawns.
    • Protect Range <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and DPS the pet until it dies.
.

.
⬥ Pet 2 spawns with BM. Position yourself just east of the northern gong, drop your DPS ultimate and <:voke:535541259465392143> the pet as soon as it spawns.
⬥ When Pet 2 reaches 500k LP, the third pet will spawn in a random corner.
    • Pet Tank 1/3 should <:voke:535541259465392143> to draw the pet away from BM, keeping it facing away from the DPS pile.

> __**North Chargers (NC)**__
.tag:nc
⬥ Draws aggression of the northern chargers and kills them.
⬥ Shortly before the mob counter reaches 0, make your way to the eastern gong.
⬥ The perimeter of the arena is lined with cages which fill with chargers once BM spawns.
    • Start north of the eastern gong, move counter-clockwise.
    • Click each cage to free the charger.
        - Take a wide turn around the northern gong so chargers do not get trapped behind the pet. Example: <https://i.imgur.com/A1bDenb.mp4>
⬥ Once you collect all the northern chargers, move along the west wall to the SW corner.
⬥ Along with the BUSC, kill chargers with AOE abilities.
    • Rangers should bring Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.
    • Magers should prioritise AOE abilities (e.g. <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:tsunamiincite:958989794757730307>).
⬥ After clearing chargers, NC becomes a DPS for the rest of the fight.

.
> **__Backup / South Chargers (BUSC)__**
.tag:busc
⬥ Clears southern chargers and helps the Base Tank with tanking BM.
⬥ To clear chargers, start south of the eastern gong and move clockwise to the SW corner, clicking cages. Example: <https://i.imgur.com/KE8qKSu.mp4>
    • AOE chargers down with the NC.
        - Rangers should bring Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.
        - Magers should prioritise AOE abilities (e.g. <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:tsunamiincite:958989794757730307>).
⬥ After clearing chargers, go directly east of the southern gong.
    • Drop your DPS ultimate and attack BM. It is safest to Protect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> until the end of the fight.
⬥ When BM reaches 750k LP **OR** one of the pets dies (whichever happens first), <:voke:535541259465392143> BM.
⬥ Aim to always have a defensive up as BM hits especially hard during this stage of the fight.
⬥ Eventually the base will provoke BM away from you.
    • In longer kills, your stacks will clear. You should then <:voke:535541259465392143> back BM. Repeat this process with the base until the end of the kill.

⬥ Once in the corner, drop your DPS ultimate and attack BM.

⬥ After BM reaches 750k hp, DPS him down as fast as possible.
⬥ The Base and BUSC should 'juggle' BM to enable eachother to clear stacks and maintain good HP.
    • All other team members are now purely DPS until BM dies.
