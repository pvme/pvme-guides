## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
Osseous, the skeletal Rex Matriarch, can be fought after completing the [Osseous Rex](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Osseous_Rex>) quest, which requires 70 Necromancy <:necromancy:1148995625896120460> and 30 Archaeology <:archaeology:941211288665739274>. Her unique drops consist of the Occultist Ring <:occulistring:1245442140318863490> and the Jail Cell Key, which can be used to unlock three separate dinosaur pets. Similar to the other Rex Matriarchs, she drops the Heart of the Berserker <:berserkerheart:855865893899468810> and parts of the Laniakea Spear <:speartip:855865894114164736> <:spearcap:855865894146932766> <:spearshaft:855865893714919465> <:spearplume:855865894033817610>.

The fight itself is one phase. The aim of this guide is to familiarise you with how to handle mechanics in order to successfully get your first solo kills.

Throughout this fight, the player will pray Deflect Necromancy <:deflectnecromancy:1137809111178813471> or Protect from Necromancy <:protectfromnecro:1137941136397324448>. If the player has access to Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> then use this instead.

## __Presets and Relics__
.tag:presets
Below is a preset we believe will lead to a great learning experience.

Necromancy is the only possible style that can damage Osseous. The preset below is not set in stone so if you are missing a couple of items, you will still be able to complete kills. Try not to downgrade too heavily though as these have been prepared with your learning experience in mind.

## __Tips and Tricks__
.tag:tips
Osseous will teach you how to mitigate damage from big hits using Defensive abilities effectively. You will also learn how to handle Area-of-Effect (AoE) mechanics and the basics of a good rotation for damage output.

Primarily in this fight, you will use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> and in some cases, you may use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> to reduce incoming damage. If you have Lesser Bone Shield <:lesserboneshield:1137809125590450276> unlocked and active, you do not need to bring a shield with you to access Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> otherwise you will need to bring a shield. **Keep in mind that equipping shields will despawn your conjures unless it is a Spectral spirit shield <:spectralspiritshield:1148977577059430461> or a Dragonfire Shroud.**

Once you are comfortable surviving and getting kills successfully at Osseous, it's time to practice some fundamentals for Necromancy ability rotations to increase your damage output. Below is a basic structure to think about and practice to try:

1) Damage boosting ultimate ability  - Living Death <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072>
2) Build adrenaline, souls or necrosis stacks using appropriate basic abilities
3) Stronger threshold abilities e.g. Finger of Death <:fingerofdeath:1159434801938432010> or Volley of Souls <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642>
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your damage boosting ultimate ability runs out and build to 100% adrenaline again
5) Repeat from step 1
