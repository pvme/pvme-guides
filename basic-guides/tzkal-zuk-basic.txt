*1. Start at the southeast corner
    a. There is a lava geyser here which can damage you, but isn’t much of a worry if you use animate dead
    b. You can move as far south as you can to attack mobs over the ledge
    c. You can move to the east to dodge the wall of fire in hardmode
2. There should only be 1-2 mobs that can attack you at a time.

.
> **__TzekHaar-Aken__**
.tag:aken
**__Wave 17__**
⬥ This is the last enemy before fighting TzKal-Zuk. His head will appear for about 40 seconds when the wave starts. He has a lot of tentacles (Mage and Ranged) which will constantly attack dealing small damage.
    • After 40 seconds, his head will submerge for about 50 seconds, in which time you can kill some of the tentacles and use defensive abilities to mitigate some damage. You do not need to kill any tentacles finish the phase. Just the head needs to die.
    • He has a mechanic that shoots a blob to your location that drains your adrenaline by 10% immediately and makes you gain 50% reduced adrenaline for a short time.
        - When his head is exposed, he only fires 1 blob at a time.
        - When he submerges, he fires blobs that expand into a 5x5 `X` shape at your players location. These can be dodge by moving out of the way.
