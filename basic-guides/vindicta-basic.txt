## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
Vindicta, the Zarosian general residing in the Heart of Gielinor, requires 80 attack <:attack:689509250472476758> (boostable) and 40 Zaros killcount to fight. Her drops include the t85 Dragon Rider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> which disassembles for Ilujankan components <:Ilujankancomp:513190158674427906> needed for the Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> perk, and the Crest of Zaros <:crestzaros:643161512177041428> which is used to make the t80 Anima Core of Zaros set <:animahelmzaros:643120081790042163>

The fight itself is split into two distinct phases. The aim of this guide is to familiarise you with how to handle mechanics in order to successfully get your first solo kills.

Throughout this fight, Vindicta's auto attacks hit the player with melee <:melee:1096130867279171706> damage. The player will pray Protect from Melee <:protectfrommelee:1052551452788269127> or Deflect Melee <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300>.

## __Presets and Relics__
.tag:presets
Below are some presets we believe will lead to a great learning experience. Magic assumes the user is on the normal spellbook.

Necromancy and Magic will be the easiest to learn with however Melee and Ranged presets can be provided in <#656898197561802760>. These are all not set in stone so if you are missing a couple of items, you will still be able to complete kills. Try not to downgrade too heavily though as these have been prepared with your learning experience in mind.

## __Tips and Tricks__
.tag:tips
This is a great boss to learn how to use a few of your Defensive abilities effectively as well as familiarise yourself with movement during an encounter. Primarily in this fight, you will use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857>, Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> to reduce incoming damage. If you have Lesser Bone Shield <:lesserboneshield:1137809125590450276> unlocked and active, you do not need to bring a shield with you to access Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> otherwise you will need to bring a shield.

Vindicta is also a great boss to practice some fundamentals when thinking about your abilities. Below is a basic structure to think about and practice:

1) Damage boosting ultimate ability <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:zerk:535532854004678657> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> / <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072>
2) Build adrenaline, souls or necrosis stacks using appropriate basic abilities
3) Stronger threshold abilities e.g. <:wm:535533809978966037> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> ,  <:assault:535532855191928842> <:destroy:535532879330148352> / <:cane:535532878969438210> , <:snap:535534127131394088> <:rapid:535541270521708566> / <:fingerofdeath:1159434801938432010>, <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642>
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your damage boosting ultimate ability runs out and build to 100% adrenaline again
5) Repeat from step 1
