#### __Introduction__
.tag:intro
A pest hiding under Falador Park. The Giant Mole is an introductory boss aimed at lower-levelled players. She will dig to a different part of the arena for every phase, indicated by a dirt arrow on the ground. This boss can be fought with tier 50-60 gear as well. The main difference between Normal Mode and Hard Mode is that the Giant Mole hits a bit harder and more quickly in Hard Mode.

## __Tips and Tricks__
.tag:tips
The Giant Mole can teach you to respond to game cues like message pop-ups and some movement, but is mostly an easy boss to get your first taste of bossing or boss kill count.

One hurdle for faster kills will be moving between the different chambers quickly, which is where mobility abilities such as <:surge:535533810004262912> and <:dive:1049378668197195808> can help a lot.

Your options for dealing damage will vary greatly depending on your gear and unlocked abilities.
⬥ When using <:magic:689504724159823906>:
    • Use strong threshold magic abilities such as <:wm:535533809978966037> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> when available.
    • You can make Giant Mole walk while <:comb:535533833098100745> is active for more damage too
    • A god staff special attack <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> is a hard-hitting attack if unlocked
⬥ When using <:necromancy:1148995625896120460>:
    • Build <:necrosis:1139452791878856805> stacks, using <:touchofdeath:1137809175980810380> to then use <:fingerofdeath:1159434801938432010>
    • Build <:residualsoul:1139453152169558046> stacks, then use <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> (or <:soulstrike:1137809142376058910>)
