**__Rotation__**
(tc) <:Vuln:537349530551582720> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:sunshine:994921119381463070> <:supergrest:690140078407680059> → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> → <:res:535541258844635148> → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:comb:535533833098100745> → <:devo:513190158728953857> → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> → Improvise with thresholds + specials + good basics to kill

.
*Note: While it is beneficial to follow the rotation, as it is written in a way to deal and mitigate damage, it is not vital to follow it. It is just important to remember that you should ultimate (<:sunshine:994921119381463070>), thresh (<:wm:535533809978966037> twice, <:asphyx:535533833072672778> once ideally), and that you should Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the cleave and Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> the frenzy.*

.
**__Tips and Tricks__**
⬥ Avoid moving unless absolutely necessary, as it will cause Helwyr to skip autos and specs
    • Only move Helwyr under the following circumstances:
        - Walking a bleed <:comb:535533833098100745>
        - Avoiding mushroom damage
        - Avoiding the frenzy when Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> is on cooldown (can just Debiliate <:debil:535541278264393729> or face tank it too)

.
⬥ If you get shroomed in your ultimate <:sunshine:994921119381463070> at the start just teleport out.
⬥ Always aim to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the cleave, ideally without protect from melee on.
.
⬥ You can Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> every other frenzy special.
⬥ Ensure to Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> when it ends, Vulnerbility <:Vuln:537349530551582720> with every second Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> you do (this will be the Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after the non-Devotioned <:devo:513190158728953857> frenzy).
.
⬥ To time Target Cycle just spam it *and* run to spot and you will get it, ideally have these binds near one another to make it easy to do
    • Refer to <#1020050319457132654> to set up Target Cycle.
    • Further, it is important to ensure you run *and* spam the bind, for if you try to Target Cycle without a target it goes on a cooldown which is reset by walking a tile
    • If you properly Target Cycle Helwyr, his HP box will not show.
