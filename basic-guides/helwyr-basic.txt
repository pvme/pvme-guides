## __Presets and Relics__
.tag:presets
Below are some presets we believe will lead to a great learning experience. Magic assumes the user is on the normal spellbook.

Necromancy and Magic will be the easiest to learn with however Melee and Ranged presets can be provided in <#656898197561802760>. These are all not set in stone so if you are missing a couple of items, you will still be able to complete kills. Try not to downgrade too heavily though as these have been prepared with your learning experience in mind.

## __Tips and Tricks__
.tag:tips
This is a great boss to learn how to use a few of your Defensive abilities effectively as well as familiarise yourself with movement during an encounter. Primarily in this fight, you will use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857>, Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> to reduce incoming damage and Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to clear bleeds. If you have Lesser Bone Shield <:lesserboneshield:1137809125590450276> unlocked and active, you do not need to bring a shield with you to access Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> otherwise you will need to bring a shield.

Helwyr is also a great boss to practice some fundamentals when thinking about your abilities. Below is a basic structure to think about and practice:

1) Damage boosting ultimate ability <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / <:zerk:535532854004678657> / <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> / <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072>
2) Build adrenaline, souls or necrosis stacks using appropriate basic abilities
3) Stronger threshold abilities e.g. <:wm:535533809978966037> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> ,  <:assault:535532855191928842> <:destroy:535532879330148352> / <:cane:535532878969438210> , <:snap:535534127131394088> <:rapid:535541270521708566> / <:fingerofdeath:1159434801938432010>, <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642>
4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your damage boosting ultimate ability runs out and build to 100% adrenaline again
5) Repeat from step 1
