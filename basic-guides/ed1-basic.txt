ED1 is a very consistent money-maker and a good avenue for players to practice using AoE abilities, movement, avoiding damaging mechanics and DPS rotations. The requirements to feasibly solo it are moderate and many deaths should be expected when learning the dungeon due to the nature of the mechanics.

⬥ Use the zerker aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:mani:643505153709965322> variants for the dungeon. Otherwise, <:vamp:643505653079343144> is fine for learning, but prioritise using defence reducing abilities for special attacks (<:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, <:quake:535532879506309150>, <:swh:641670143197446182> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>) on Masuta and Seiryu's face. Also, expect to do additional cycles on Seiryu.

.
The first boss you encounter. Sanctum uses primarily slow <:range:580168050121113623> auto attacks which hit moderately hard. However, they are aimed at the players' tile instead of character so you are able to dodge them by stepping away 3 or more tiles before they hit.

⬥ If using <:range:580168050121113623>, you may find it useful to side step attacks from time to time as you have the most mobility while using abilities.

⬥ An easy way to dodge Water Jet if fighting Sanctum from the front is standing east then walking west as follows:

### Masuta, the Ascended (Fight tips)
.tag:masutatips
⬥ You may want to bank or use a preset with more food for this encounter.

.
⬥ If you receive a second Hurricane special (where <:devo:513190158728953857> is down), try to stay as far away from Masuta as possible. Use <:debil:535541278264393729> or <:reflect:535541258786177064> if needed.

.
⬥ Using channelled abilities such as <:asphyx:535533833072672778> <:destroy:535532879330148352> or <:snipe:535541258425204770> will help you avoid getting walked while Masuta spins.
    • This does not work on channelled special attacks such as <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> and you will get walked

.
⬥ Rotation outlines:
    • These rotations are to be used at the start and then repeated after waters to finish Masuta off.
    • <:devo:513190158728953857> will need to be used some time after the first threshold, unless you are kiting
        ⬩ <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed.

.
⬥ Using <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880> to finish off waters and <:anti:535541306475151390> between spawns help with reducing food usage.
    • You can also <:res:535541258844635148> an occasional waters auto if needed.

.
⬥ When Masuta resumes attacking after waters, make sure you are high HP as he will do 2 <:range:580168050121113623> autos while you are probably still finish off the remaining waters, which deal <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage. This damage can stack you out if not careful.

### Seiryu, the Azure Serpent (Fight tips)
.tag:seiryutips
.
⬥ Seiryu can be <:flankicon:841419289755385866> permanently when standing along the 2 southern rows of the arena.
    • Be careful of the V-shaped Shadow Hands if doing this.

⬥ HP can be sustained very easily if <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking.
    • If not, the easiest way to sustain your HP without needing much food is using <:res:535541258844635148> on the huge breath attack.

.
⬥ Move as little you need to avoid the shadow mechanics, to avoid negatively affecting your DPS.
    • 1 tile east for blackholes.
    • 2-3 tiles to avoid hands from shadow energy.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ktXTzON.mp4
.
⬥ For learners, you will likely start off with 3-cycling Seiryu, eventually being able to 2-cycle once comfortable with the fight.

⬥ Start of fight:
    • Use your damage boosting ultimate <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> to start the fight.
    • Use abilities until Seiryu phases. Do not use your ultimate again.
    • When Seiryu is at around 7250k, build to 100% adrenaline and prepare to jump.
    • When Seiryu lowers his head, quickly go to either jump tile and go up ASAP. <:bdmobile:867678153668820992> there if you can.

.
⬥ Shackle:
    • <:surgemobile:867678153798975498> towards the first crystal and use your damage boosting ultimate <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> with <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and deploy <:dommine:662249620579155968> immediately.
    • Kill the first crystal and build until the first waves of heals are complete, then get in as much damage on the second crystal as possible until you get dragged down.
        ⬩ Use <:dommine:662249620579155968> immediately once they're off cooldown.

.
⬥ Post-shackle:
    • Immediately tag and kill enigmas when you are on the ground.
    • Use your damage boosting ultimate <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> again on Seiryu and repeat what you did at the start.

.
⬥ Second shackle:
    • If you had a lot of time left after killing the first crystal during the first shackle, go for a 2-cycle.
    • Jump up from a different side to attack the crystal at full HP.
    • Use your <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> with <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> with <:dommine:662249620579155968> immediately after going up and then finish off the middle crystal with your strongest abilities afterwards.
    • If the remaining crystal has too much health for you to finish off before the heals start, do a 3rd cycle.

.
### Mobs and movement
.tag:mobs
Although mobs in ED1 do not have much HP, many of them have mechanics with very high KO potential. Do not be surprised if you die to any of these.

.
⬥ Death Lotus Assassins
    • These are by far the most dangerous mobs and are found in 2 areas, after Sanctum Guardian and before Masuta. You do not need to kill them to proceed.
    • At the part after Sanctum, use <:devo:513190158728953857> with <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> after 'You are no more!' while clearing the 3 Zealots to avoid dying.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/rwE2Ei3.mp4
.
    • 2 more are found near the barrier before Masuta. You may aggro them while running to the 4 Zealots you need to clear to open the barrier.
        ⬩ Pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and food in mouth if needed. Teleport out **after opening the gate** if needing to bank.
        ⬩ Don't use <:devo:513190158728953857> here if going into Masuta directly as you will need <:devo:513190158728953857> for Masuta's hurricane.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/IwHIix8.png
.
    • Always use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> when you see them attacking no matter what as they can hit you from a decent distance.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/WoaCM1c.mp4
.
⬥ Hanto Sellswords
    • These can be found right after Sanctum Guardian and near the Menaphite Soldiers before Masuta.
    • It is not necessary to kill them to proceed.
    • Beware of their 'Die by the blade!' attack where they spin their spear, dealing very heavy melee damage which can 2-3 hit you if not careful.
        ⬩ Quickly use <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and eat or <:stunicon:841419289428492369> them to stop it.

.
⬥ Defence pylons
    • They attacking using rapid moderate <:Magic:689504724159823906> beams and are quite long-ranged.
    • You need to kill 3 of these to access Seiryu.
    • It is recommended to go into the Seiryu encounter after Masuta straight as using the bank chest near Seiryu is not practical due to getting harassed by these crystals.
        ⬩ You can always teleport out **after opening the gate to Seiryu** if needed to stop their aggro.
    • Pray <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> and use <:devo:513190158728953857> right before engaging the first Pylon. Kill it fast to extend <:devo:513190158728953857> before killing 2 more.
    • Try to end on high adrenaline and proceed to Seiryu
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/9JmjLtG.mp4
.
⬥ Other noteworthy mobs
    • Elite Sakadagami: Uses highly damaging <:Magic:689504724159823906> abilities which can also stun you. Use <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> especially if facing multiple of them.
    • Elite Sotapanna: Occasionally heals damaged mobs to full using a healing orb.
    • Arhats and Anagami: Can follow you into the Sanctum Guardian fight, making it much harder. Teleport out to get rid of them if needed.

.
⬥ AoEs by style, generally from most to least viable
    • Melee: <:cane:535532878969438210> > <:quake:535532879506309150> > <:flurry:864492981763702834> > <:cleave:535532878616985610> > targeted <:bd:535532854281764884>
        ⬩ <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is extremely good at places with lots of enemies.
    • Ranged: <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:rapid:535541270521708566> > <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snap:535534127131394088> > <:bombard:535541306391265284> > <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> > <:mechchin:641669268722810881> basic > <:ricocaroming:867678153635004447>
        ⬩ <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386> is good way to clear hordes of enemies fast to avoid getting overwhelmed.
    • Magic: <:tsunamiincite:958989794757730307> > <:deto:535533833358016512> > <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> > <:dbreath:535533833391702017> > <:chaincaroming:867678153962684426>
        ⬩ 4TAA using <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> or <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> is very helpful for clears.
        ⬩ <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> should be used whenever possible if owned for clears, especially with <:omnipowerigneous:1179505745654448208>

.
⬥ Some good places to use <:accel:756236265472524418> are as follows:
    • This helps you avoid taking unnecessary damage from mobs while clearing the dungeon.
