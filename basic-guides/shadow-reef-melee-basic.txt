> __**Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
The first boss you will encounter is the Crassian Leviathan. Poison <:weppoison:689525476158472288> is extremely important for this boss to reduce its healing.

⬥ If using Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> as your halberd, camp dual wields <:darkiceshard:915232154160594974><:darkicesliver:915232153787334677> unless using <:cleave:535532878616985610> or <:quake:535532879506309150>.
    • <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:surge:535533810004262912> mid gcd + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → Target cycle + <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to begin fight.
    • Execute <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotation and bleed <:gflurry:535532879283879977> to reduce <:Berserk:513190158468907012> cooldown.

⬥ Fight start: The Leviathan will unleash a stream of breath that almost instantly kills you if stood in. Click repeatedly on one of the 2 tiles shown below in red boxes to ensure your character stays out.
    • You do not repeated clicking if using a halberd type weapon.
    • **If using a channel, do not spam click as it cancels the channel. The channel itself will keep you in place.**
    • Click immediately before cancelling channels with a non-channeled ability to prevent movement post-channel.
    • If you don't see your familiar, call them <:callfollower:933299003121078332> as they tend to get stuck outside.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/wKjEfc9.png
.
⬥ Post breath attack: The Leviathan does 2 autos → 2 head sweeps → 2 autos → 2 head sweeps → 2 autos → switch sides starting around when <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ends.
    • Alternate standing on the 2 different safespots to continue DPS-ing losslessly while mostly avoiding sweeps.
    • After getting comfortable with the boss, you can choose to tank some head sweep hits to keep HP below half for <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> and continous healing which works with <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228>.

⬥ After <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, use basics prioritising <:dismember:535532879376023572> together with 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> and <:cane:535532878969438210>.
    • Try to use <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> and <:cane:535532878969438210> after Fury <:fury:535532879510372352>.
    • Start building to 91% adrenaline when the 2nd set of head sweeps begin.

.
⬥ When you're >91% adrenaline and <:Berserk:513190158468907012> is about to come off cooldown, off and <:anti:535541306475151390>, followed by a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation.
    • Walk to either safe tile before clicking the floor and casting <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to avoid barging into a head sweep.

⬥ 2 auto attacks after the 2nd set of head sweeps, the Leviathan retreats and appears on the other side of the arena to repeat the same set of attacks, **including breath**.
    • Flanking <:flankicon:841419289755385866> can be used on the Crassian Leviathan on this side.
    • Safe spots apply.

.
> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
The second boss is Taraket which attacks using primarily damaging but slow Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> autos. You will need good DPS to avoid getting overwhelmed at this boss. <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> is thus almost mandatory as it provides 20% additional damage and accuracy to Taraket and his minions.

⬥ You can afford to camp <:lanispear:839903893177106454> more as there are no accuracy issues to take advantage of the increased poison damage.

⬥ To start the fight, execute a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation on Taraket, bleeding <:destroy:535532879330148352>.
    • Use <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> after using your first threshold.

⬥ <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking is extremely effective for Taraket as his attacks are slow and telegraphed.

.
⬥ Around the time <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ends, Taraket will spawn an undead portal with 30k HP. It occasionally spawns skeletons and should be killed before the blue bar runs out to avoid heavy damage.
    • If Taraket still has >30k HP from 200K, perform the following sequence to phase him and kill the portal in time:
        - <:slaughter:535532879237873666> followed by <:escape:535541258832052231> mid gcd and then walking until 2 tiles from the south wall (lure demonstrated in gif below)
        - Use 2 defensives <:freedom:535541258240786434> <:anti:535541306475151390>.
        - <:gbarge:535532879250456578> back and bleed a Threshold on the portal.
        - Use AoE abilities <:cleave:535532878616985610> <:cane:535532878969438210> <:quake:535532879506309150> targeting the portal to kill it, phase Taraket to below 200k HP and clear the skeletons spawned halberd <:bd:535532854281764884> with resets.
    • If Taraket is near 200k when portal spawns, simply phase Taraket and use <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and powerful thresholds to clear the portal.

.
.img:https://imgur.com/ONzYKNv.mp4
.
⬥ The first 2 times Taraket falls below **200k** HP, he will become immune, fly to a side of the arena, spawn a 135k HP minion and heal for 100k HP before returning to the middle. The minions are:
    • Bloated Monstrosity (East): Taraket spawns it first by default. It attacks using melee and empowers Taraket's auto attacks.
    • Corpse Carrier (West): Taraket spawns it second by default. It attacks using melee and occasionally spawns skeletons that attack you.
        - Carrier spawning first can be forced by moving Taraket west, such as using <:kick:535532879132885025> while standing east of Taraket.
        - During spawning animations, use defensives or basics on Taraket to generate adrenaline.

⬥ What you want him spawning first depends on your level of skill as a meleer:
    • **[1] Beginner**: Spawn Bloat → Kill Bloat while AoEing Taraket → Phase Taraket → Spawn Carrier → Kill Carrier and Skeletons → Proceed to final phase
    • **[2] Experienced**: Spawn Corpse Carrier → AoE Corpse Carrier with Taraket → Finish off Corpse Carrier and Skeletons while Taraket spawns Bloat → Proceed to final phase (Recommended for preset in this guide)

⬥ From the first spawn onwards, when you see Taraket speak and use <:deathsswift:535541258924326912>, switch to flicking between <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>.

.
⬥ If doing **[2]**:
    • Use <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> right before Carrier spawns → Auto with 2H + <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:BloodTend:513190158431158274> → (walked <:slaughter:535532879237873666> if up) on Carrier and then focus Taraket.
    • Use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> on Taraket and Carrier followed by AoE abilties. Phase Taraket using Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>.
        - Not phasing Taraket in time will cause him to kill any skeletons alive to heal himself.
    • Use Overpower <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> and Basics if needed to finish off Carrier.
    • Use halberd <:bd:535532854281764884> repeatedly with resets to finish off any remaining skeletons.
    • Target Taraket and use defensives and basics to get 100% adren in preparation for final phase.

.
⬥ For the final phase, after Taraket has spawned the second minion:
    • <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> when Taraket returns to center → <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + activate <:excal:641337999170207763> to begin last phase.
    • After <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, use bleeds.
    • Refresh <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>, and finish the kill with <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316>, basics and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.
    • If lacking damage, you might need to kill more portals Taraket spawns.

⬥ During the final phase, walk behind Taraket immediately when he speaks while in <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> to avoid taking massive melee damage from a line of ghosts:
    • If you <:kick:535532879132885025> Taraket right before he uses this attack, do not walk behind him as he will be facing away from you.
    • Taraket can be flanked <:flankicon:841419289755385866> from behind during this brief duration.

.
⬥ Example [2]: 2:11 Kill, basic preset <https://youtu.be/aNZBcYmSCek>

.
> __**The Ambassador**__
.tag:ambi
The final boss of Elite Dungeon 3 is The Ambassador (Ambi), a highly damaging boss that attacks with 100% accuracy. <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking is heavily recommended, else a secondary preset with more food is likely needed just for Ambi.

⬥ <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:surge:535533810004262912> mid gcd + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → Target cycle + <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to begin fight.
    • When you <:surge:535533810004262912> into the arena, Ambi will launch a powerful blue magic attack that can be either Vengeanced <:Veng:543478434953822208> or blocked with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> (recommended for non-<:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flickers).
    • Bleed <:destroy:535532879330148352> followed by using <:assault:535532853979512842>, 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977> and <:cane:535532878969438210>.

⬥ Post <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, use <:dismember:535532879376023572> whenever off cooldown, and <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> as soon as you hit >60% adrenaline.

⬥ Stand in the **north east quardrant** once the overhead blue bar on your head depletes to drop **first smoke**. Because each bar generates 2 smokes, stand still for another ability to drop both in the same spot.

⬥ Move south into the south east quardrant and cycle through your thresholds once more except for <:gflurry:535532879283879977>.

.
⬥ Ambi will spawn a black hole. Powerburst of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> when the black hole's blue bar is around 1/4 to tank it.
    • Ensure you have more than 50% HP when you do this.
    • Beware of getting potblocked. Do not drink any potions before using <:vitality:654618235097972737>.

⬥ Use <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> as soon as it's up.
    • This should be about when you drop the **second smoke** in the **south east quardrant**.

⬥ Ambi will become immune at 0:59, use defensives and walk south east to prepare for spinners.

.
⬥ Ambi will spread his arms and release 6 spinners each with 20k HP while firing 3 anticlockwise-moving laser beams which you must avoid.
    • A minute later, he will absorb any remaining spinners. For each absorbed, he will channel an explosion that deals huge soft typeless damage.
    • Here, it is recommended to clear 5 spinners, blocking the explosion from the leftover spinner using <:disrupt:535614336207552523>.
    • Clear spinners using mostly basics and occasionally thresholds.
        - If effective with damage and stalling abilities, get in a <:nat:535541258131865633> <:DBA:603979368850653216> build while also clearing 5 spinners.
    • You can TC + <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the southwest spinner (first spinner) when ambi raises his arms, even before it appears.

⬥ After 5 spinners, target Ambi and get 100% adren. When you see the last spinner enter Ambi, execute a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation bleeding <:assault:535532853979512842> and channelling a 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977>.
    • Use <:disrupt:535614336207552523> right before the blue bar overhead ambi depletes.

.
⬥ Post <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, use <:dismember:535532879376023572> whenever off cooldown, and <:overpower:535532879334080517> <:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> as soon as you hit >60% adrenaline.
    • Drop **third purple smoke** in the **south west quardrant**, around the time you use <:overpower:535532879334080517>.
    • Build using basics and use <:assault:535532853979512842> as soon as it comes off cooldown.
    • Get in a 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977> and maybe <:BloodTend:513190158431158274>.

⬥ Tank the second black hole using <:vitality:654618235097972737> like you do in phase 1.
    • Be more careful with this one as it will come off cooldown close to when the black hole explodes.

⬥ Before dropping the **fourth smoke**, build to near 100% adrenaline and **<:bd:535532854281764884> away to place purple smoke**. Use defensives to get 100% adrenaline and execute a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> rotation.
    • Get in a 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977>.
    • Remember to activate <:excal:641337999170207763> after this point whenever HP dips below 50%.

.
⬥ Ambi will begin the ritual phase. Watch for a stream of smokes that a black hand will send to Ambi to heal him, walk between Ambi and the smokes.
    • The smokes will move in a clockwise direction. Follow their movement and try to block Ambi from healing.
    • Use <:overpower:535532879334080517><:igneouskalket:902209626404192316> post <:Berserk:513190158468907012> and build to >80% spending excess on thresholds.
    • When Ambi says **"Fall now and be forgotten"**, use <:devo:513190158728953857> with <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> to negate the damage from a series of large magic hits.
        - Return to flicking between <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> once the magic hits are over.
    • Get in a 3-hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977> if intending to finish Ambi off with a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> before second barrage.

⬥ What happens next depends on your skill as a meleer and Ambi's hp:
    • **Confident with melee, Ambi has less than 135k HP**: Off Ambi and use a defensive followed by a <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation to finish the kill.
    • **Otherwise**: Use thresholds while keeping adrenaline >75% and use <:debil:535541278264393729> <:reflect:535541258786177064> when ambi uses the second barrage. Use <:Berserk:513190158468907012> to finish the kill if needed.
