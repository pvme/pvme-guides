ED3 is considered the hardest Elite Dungeon in the trilogy. The requirements to feasibly solo it both in terms of gear and skill is generally considered higher than that of ED1 and ED2.

⬥ Use the zerker aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:mani:643505153709965322> variants for the dungeon. Otherwise, <:vamp:643505653079343144> is fine for learning.

⬥ Use a <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> familiar if using <:vamp:643505653079343144>

__**Crassian Leviathan (Info)**__
.tag:crassianmechs
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VENcARf.jpg
.
The first boss you encounter. The boss heals over time, use <:weppoison:689525476158472288> and <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812> to slow the healing. It uses moderate but slow auto attacks (<:melee:615612332521029632> if player in melee distance, <:Ranged:689504724403486920> otherwise)
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poisonous Breath** - The first mechanic of the fight. The Leviathan fires a breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage and contaminating the arena. Move to the side after initiating the fight to avoid death.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/RCt6T7m.mp4
.
⬥ There are 2 safespots for Crassian shown below. Stand here and you will be safe from Breath and headsweeps.
    • Use your halberd if you're meleeing here during Poisonous Breath to avoid getting dragged in and dying instantly.
    • <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> and <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> at these spots.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/wKjEfc9.png
.
⬥ **Many Heads** - The Leviathan has additional heads that will stun and poison you in the contaminated zones if you are near them.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/YDfiuOf.mp4
.
⬥ **Head Sweep** - The Leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing repeated typeless damage of around 4000 each if caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.
    • Crassian's starting attack pattern is Breath → 1 auto → sweeps → 2 autos → sweeps → Tactical Retreat
.
.img:https://imgur.com/5sWppnG.mp4

.
⬥ **Tactical Retreat** - After going through one **Poisonous Breath** and two sets of **Head Sweeps**, the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his rotation.
    • <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> to the other once this.
    • Leviathan switching sides counts as walking for <:comb:535533833098100745> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> <:frag:535541273755385885>

.
Taraket and his minions are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648>, Undead Slayer perk <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> purposes. Taraket uses heavy <:Magic:689504724159823906> auto attacks (<:Ranged:689504724403486920> when he is in <:deathsswift:535541258924326912>).

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** -  This Rift with 30k HP will spawn skeletons periodically.
    • Kill the Rift before the blue bar runs out, to avoid being dealt up to 9,000 hard typeless damage.
    • This mechanic is repeated throughout the fight.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Xq8JxyR.mp4
.
.img:https://imgur.com/lNWdkWt.mp4
.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket uses Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switches to attacking using Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones.
    • Remember to change your prayer flicking accordingly.
    • This mechanic is repeated throughout the fight.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/pkwjo5O.mp4
.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards a black crystal at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each.
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs until its death.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/L3klbH8.mp4
.
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's auto-attacks.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/LeJAsiN.mp4
.
        - Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed.
        - Kill these as soon as possible to avoid taking too much damage.
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards.
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket.

.
⬥ **Spirit Wall** - Taraket smashes the ground infront of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits infront of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact.
    • Taraket does this twice almost consecutively.
    • Move out of the way as needed be.
        - You can walk behind him to dodge both attacks if in melee distance.
        - Avoid this attack no matter what, it has the highest KO potential.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ESTxXSQ.mp4
.
⬥ **Absorb Undeath** - Periodically, Taraket may absorb all skeletons in the arena to heal 2,000 per skeleton.

⬥ For the first rift, players may do the following lure when the fight begins to stack Taraket together with the rift when it spawns to AoE both targets easily.
    • There's no need to do this if confident in phasing Taraket and then dealing with the portal or tanking his attacks while killing the portal.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/pukl6qm.mp4
.
⬥ Because Taraket's auto attacks are slow and obvious, <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking is strongly recommended.
    • When he starts using <:deathsswift:535541258924326912>, zoom in to see if he is using <:Magic:689504724159823906> or <:Ranged:689504724403486920> autos.

        - Finish Bloated once Taraket is phased.
    • Carrier spawn: <:zerk:535532854004678657> and kill Corpse Carrier.
        - <:bd:535532854281764884> with halberd <:lanispear:839903893177106454> to clear skeletons if needed.

⬥ **Magic 1st Auto vs Melee 1st Auto**
    • Doing <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> to reach melee distance at the start of the fight will switch the 1st auto into a melee auto.
    • Changing the 1st auto into a melee auto changes the timing of the 1st smoke.
        - Mage 1st auto causes a 22.8s (38t) 1st smoke drop.
        - Melee 1st auto causes a 31.8s (53t) 1st smoke drop.
    • No other timings are changed.

.
⬥ **550k - 400k**
    • Crassian Ritual Keepers are summoned periodically.
    • Ambi stops using Tribeam, Sinister Fragments and Pulse of Erebus.

.
⬥ **Seiryu's Intervention - Death**
    • 5 autos → Melee / Magic auto → 5 autos → Melee / Magic auto → Shadow Onslaught

.
**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Black Stone Flames**
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head.
    • When this bar nears depletion, two 5x5 areas around the player will become corrupted, separated by 2 ticks.
        - Don't move out immediately after the first smoke drops to drop both at the same place.
        - Try to place the smokes next to each other.
        - These zones will ramp up to 2000 typeless hits to anyone standing inside, get out when both are dropped.
        - If using <:melee:615612332521029632> you may want to <:escape:535541258832052231> or <:bd:535532854281764884> away to drop them.
    • They remain until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase.
.

.
⬥ **Unstable Black Hole**
    • The Ambassador will spawn an unstable black hole near the area.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/KkpYl0Z.mp4
.
    • Stun it before the blue bar runs out to avoid a hard typeless hit (explosion shown below) of up to 9,000, using abilities such as:
        - <:melee:615612332521029632> <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:bd:535532854281764884> back to Ambi or <:vitality:654618235097972737> with more than ~6k HP to tank
        - <:Ranged:689504724403486920> <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> or <:demoralise:535541258559553546>
        - <:Magic:689504724159823906> <:impact:535533809655873556> or <:shock:535533809932697610>
.
.img:https://imgur.com/mOScu8K.mp4
.
⬥ **Tribeam & Sinister Fragments**
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute.
    • The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use the Fragments every full attack rotation **or** by hitting the 650K cap until the next phase commences.
*Tribeam Unleashed*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Vg7ztvk.mp4
.
    • Ambi absorbs any remaining fragments after a minute, and releases a **Pulse of Erebus** per absorption, dealing 8,000 soft typeless damage.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/3U8LBRS.mp4
.
        - You can opt to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or <:res:535541258844635148> to block a explosion hit.
    • Use <:bd:535532854281764884> to move between spinners as its cooldown will be reset by each spinner death.
    • Using Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> on each spinner can help.
    • The spinners are not immune to roots, binds and can be moved.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ Tribeam, Sinister Fragments and Pulse of Erebus are no longer used.

⬥ Ambi spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making <:res:535541258844635148> harder to use.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GuVOe7f.mp4
.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Black Stone Flames and Unstable Black Holes are no longer used.

⬥ Seiryu intervenes shortly after, healing you to full.

*Seiryu's Intervention*
.
.img:https://imgur.com/q39LXoM.mp4
.
⬥ Black hands will spawn, encircling the edge of the arena.
    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smokes towards the Ambassador. Unblocked smokes heal Ambi for 2500 each.
        - The first outburst of smokes is unblockable.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/lzYID2k.mp4
.
.img:https://imgur.com/OJdaot8.mp4
.
        - Standing between the Ambassador and the projectiles will make them black, damaging you for a small typeless hit and preventing Ambi from getting healed. **Doing this is necessary**.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/h6f0cFc.mp4
.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught**
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, Ambi will say 'Fall now and be forgotten' and send out 5 hits that deal about 8000 magic damage each (40k total if taken raw).
.
.img:https://imgur.com/xPYzNrs.mp4

.
⬥ Blocking Magic Onslaught (from most to least ideal):
    • Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> (Can't be used for b2b Onslaughts due to cooldown)
    • Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Vitality Powerburst <:vitality:654618235097972737> and eat.
    • Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> and eat.

__**The Ambassador (Fight tips)**__
.tag:ambitips
⬥ Although it is not easy, <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking is extremely recommended during this fight.
    • Consider bringing more food if unable to <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flick.
    • This is more so the case for <:Ranged:689504724403486920> as it does not have inbuilt damage reduction unlike <:Magic:689504724159823906> with <:animatedead:856635090453135382> or sustain like <:melee:615612332521029632> with <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>.

⬥ You can want to occasionally <:res:535541258844635148> if having trouble sustaining HP.
    • This is not feasible when Crassian scouts are active.

⬥ Using target cycle when Ambi flaps open his arms will allow you to hit spinners before you can click on them.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/dVoH6Re.mp4
.
⬥ Save <:excal:641337999170207763> after Ambi spawns Crassian scouts or during last phase as you take the most damage during these phases.

.
⬥ For <:melee:615612332521029632>, follow the general pattern of <:zerk:535532854004678657> rotation → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:bloodtend:513190158431158274> → <:overpowerigneous:959089455640215633> → good thresholds
    • Use <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> for <:zerk:535532854004678657>
    • Repeat the general rotation as many times as you need post spinners.

.
⬥ For <:Ranged:689504724403486920>, follow the general pattern of <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309> rotation → <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386> → good thresholds
    • Use <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> for <:deathsswiftpf:867678153949708309>
    • Drop smoke at the edge of <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> and move to the other side.
    • Repeat the general rotation as many times as you need post spinners.

.
⬥ For <:Magic:689504724159823906>, follow the general pattern of <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> rotation → good thresholds → <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200> outside of <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Use <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> for <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868>
    • Drop smoke at the edge of <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and move to the other side.
    • Repeat the general rotation as many times as you need post spinners.

.
⬥ For the last phase focus on blocking the healing smoke, sustaining your HP, and surviving the Magical Onslaughts.

⬥ If uncertain of the timing of second Magical Onslaught, avoid ulting or using igneous abilities to avoid being unable to <:reflect:535541258786177064> (and <:debil:535541278264393729> if not using <:vitality:654618235097972737>).

.
__**Mobs and movement**__
.tag:mobs
Although it appears easy, moving and clearing mobs efficiently can greatly affect the quality of a run. Clearing slowly may allow many mobs to catch up to you and damage you in an Elite Dungeon, increasing the amount of food required. Be mindful of your adrenaline and captilise on AoE abils whenever feasible.

⬥ AoEs by style, generally from most to least viable
    • Melee: <:cane:535532878969438210> > <:quake:535532879506309150> > <:flurry:864492981763702834> > <:cleave:535532878616985610> > targeted <:bd:535532854281764884>
        - <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is viable at places with >3 enemies.
    • Ranged: <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:rapid:535541270521708566> > <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snap:535534127131394088> > <:bombard:535541306391265284> > <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> > <:mechchin:641669268722810881> basic > <:ricocaroming:867678153635004447>
        - <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386> is good on enemies with high HP such as Warped Skeletons and Sea Horrors.
    • Magic: <:tsunamiincite:958989794757730307> > <:deto:535533833358016512> > <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> > <:dbreath:535533833391702017> > <:chaincaroming:867678153962684426>
        - 4TAA using <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> or <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> is very helpful for clears.
        - <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> should be used whenever possible if owned for clears, in combination with powerful thresholds or even <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200>

⬥ If running and not hitting mobs, be sure to use protection prayers against the mobs hitting you and run quickly through them.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/vMUfgFi.mp4
.
⬥ You can move behind mobs or back yourself into corners to prevent melee mobs from attacking you.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/hqzM2R3.mp4
.
⬥ One of the most dangerous parts in ED3 is the bridge before Taraket with skeleton archers.
    • The Sea Horrors have a spec that does high typeless damage which can catch you off guard.
    • Skeleton Archers will attack you rapidly with ranged, as such, <:devo:513190158728953857> and pray <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>
    • For <:melee:615612332521029632>, back yourself into a corner to prevent a Horror from attacking you and use your halberd to AoE.
.

.
    • For <:Ranged:689504724403486920>, use <:mechchin:641669268722810881> and target the Necromancer, then use <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> → basics → <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386> → kite out the Horrors.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/Tp0aI9S.mp4
.
    • For <:Magic:689504724159823906>, use <:dbreath:535533833391702017> from afar targetting the Necromancer, then <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:deto:535533833358016512>, and kite out the horrors.

⬥ Take advantage of diagonal movement to move quicker and avoid attracting unwanted aggression.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/mYnzcHG.mp4
.
⬥ Do the following <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:bd:535532854281764884> or hug the west wall to prevent, as much as possible, attracting the aggression of the minibosses before Ambi.
