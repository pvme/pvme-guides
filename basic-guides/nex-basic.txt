## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
Nex is the Zarosian general found within the God Wars Dungeon. The [frozen key](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Frozen_key>) is required in order to access the area of the dungeon where Nex is located.

⬥ 40 kill count is required in order access the encounter.
    • This can be bypassed by wearing a **full** set of [ancient ceremonial robes](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Ancient_ceremonial_robe_outfit>) <:ceremonialmask:580177522629804062>
⬥ The ability to access Nex **without** any of the usual requirements may be purchased for 10 million coins, a full set of ancient ceremonial robes, and the frozen key.
    • This may be purchased by speaking with the banker, [Ashuelot Reis](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Ashuelot_Reis>).

## __Mechanics__
.tag:mechanics
### Nex Overview
⬥ Nex is a 1x1 NPC and has very strict softcaps, which means that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase.
    • During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above **5,000 by 50%**.
        ⬩ For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage.
    • On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above **2,000 by 75%**.
        ⬩ This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000.

.
### Mages Overview
⬥ Mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%.
⬥ Each mage has 10,000 health and possesses a max hit of around 850. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name.

*Note: Nex has 5 phases; Smoke, Shadow, Blood, Ice, and Zaros. Each phase has 2 special attacks, with the exception of Zaros.*

## __The Fight__
.tag:fight
### Preventing Nex from Meleeing
Matching or having a higher Ranged defence compared to your Magic defence as shown below (found on the "Hero" tab in the subsection "loadout") will prevent Nex from attempting to melee you during the smoke and shadow phases.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/7yyiVRl.png

.
### Useful Optional Unlocks
⬥ The Mazcab ability codex ability Corruption shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> is good for using on the 4 mages due to their low hitcaps.
⬥ The Mazcab ability codex ability Onslaught <:onsl:513190159085207555> is a method sometimes preferred to deal with blood phase with such budget gear.
⬥ An Adrenaline Potion (<:replenpot:641337470491033600> , <:enhreplen:634350450887622656> or <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>) if you're struggling with adrenaline or after you use an ultimate ability could help.

.
## __Rotations__
.tag:rotations
### Notes Before The Fight
⬥ Try and Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> as close to 10 seconds on the kill timer.
⬥ The easiest way to kite Nex (only whilst she is attempting to melee you) is to move as a horse/knight does in chess (or in the shape of an L), then continuing. If you are having trouble with this, then another legitimate method is to flail your mouse and continuously click (this will be less effective but can stall her a good amount).

.
### Smoke Phase
⬥ Vulnerability bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> Nex either just before she is attackable (12.0s on the boss kill timer) or during the early stages of the smoke phase.
⬥ Utilise <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:frag:535541273755385885> (move far away from Nex after using in order to double the damage of this ability) → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088>
    • Once she phases (160,000 HP) it's time for Fumus. Try to use bleeds (<:frag:535541273755385885> + <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> [if owned]). Save <:rapid:535541270521708566> for Shadow phase.
    • Using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> will be nice here to disallow Nex to stun you whilst you're killing Fumus.

.
### Shadow Phase
⬥ Be sure to switch to protect range <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>.
⬥ Utilise <:rapid:535541270521708566> → improvise strong abilities (try and save <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> for blood if you can).
    • Once she phases (120,000 HP), it's time for Umbra. Try to kill him in the exact same way as you killed Fumus previously (including the saving of <:rapid:535541270521708566>).

.
### Blood Phase
⬥ Be sure to switch back to protect magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.
⬥ Throw another Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Be sure to switch to your range helmet and gloves if you're using the melee armour strategy.
    • Try to <:snipe:535541258425204770> as her wings reach their highest point or after. Utilise <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.
    • Once she phases (80,000 HP), your next target is Cruor. Dispatch of him the same way you did Fumus and Umbra with one potential difference. Using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and allowing yourself to do an auto attack is a good way to mitigate a good chunk of damage without sacrificing much/any damage you deal.

.
### Ice Phase
⬥ Utilise <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → good basics/lower damaging thresholds.
    • Once she phases (40,000 HP), it's time for the final minion, Glacies.
    • Use whatever you can to kill him as quickly as possible. <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Bleeds are an excellent way to deal lots of damage to him quickly to avoid any further prisons from Nex.

.
### Zaros Phase
⬥ Utilise <:rapid:535541270521708566> → good basics → <:deadshot:535541307666595870> → basics until you're able to <:rapid:535541270521708566> again. (Try to use low multiple-hitting, low damaging abilities such as bleeds as frequently as you can).
    • If you brought an Adrenaline Potion <:replenpot:641337470491033600>, use it after <:deadshot:535541307666595870> to use more thresholds before your second <:rapid:535541270521708566>.
