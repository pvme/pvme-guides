**__Preventing Nex from meleeing__**
Matching or having a higher Ranged defence compared to your Magic defence as shown below (found on the "Hero" tab in the subsection "loadout") will prevent Nex from attempting to melee you during the smoke and shadow phases.

.
**__Recommended Perks and Relics__**
⬥ <:p6:712073088769982475> Precise 6 and <:eq4:712073088589627505> Equillibrium 4 are highly recommended for your weapon of choice.
⬥ <:biting2:967752660822401074> Biting 2 or above is a cheap and effective perk alongside <:crack4:712073087662686249> Crackling 4.
    • If you have two pieces of augmented armour then <:imp4:712073088204013640> and <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> should also be used.

⬥ Any combination of: Blessing of Het <:blessingofhet:934078945391947817> Berserker's Fury <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> Fury of the Small <:furyofthesmall:697808773917573233> Death's Ward <:deathward:697808774068699286>
    • If you are unable to afford to switch too regularly then no relics will do just fine.

.
**__Recommended gear/loadout upgrades (optional)__**
⬥ Upgrading to a better bow (Noxious <:noxbow:513190159425208342> or a Decimation <:decimation:643848618477879328>) or Ascension Crossbows <:ascmh:513190158468775936> <:ascoh:513190159362031631>.
⬥ Nightmare Gauntlets <:NMG:513190159441723392> or Swift gloves.
⬥ An Adrenaline Potion <:replen:634350514406162436> if you're struggling with adrenaline or after you use an ultimate ability could help.
⬥ An Essence of finality amulet <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> with a Dark bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> stored inside will help greatly. Other useful amulets include a Reaper Necklace <:Reaper:513190159412494367> or an Amulet of Souls <:aos:513190158359724056>.
⬥ An Igneous Kal-Xil <:igneouskalxil:902209626404171786> helps tremendously. The ability of the cape could be used effectively on Shadow, Ice and Zaros phases.
⬥ The Mazcab ability codex abilities Corruption shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> and Onslaught <:onsl:513190159085207555> can be very good additions to your arsenal.
    • Corruption shot is mainly for use on the 4 mages, and Onslaught can be a preferred method to deal with blood phase with such budget gear.

**__Nex overview__**
⬥ Nex is a 1x1 NPC and has very strict softcaps, which means that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase.
    • During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above **5,000 by 50%**.
        ⬩ For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage.
    • On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above **2,000 by 75%**.
        ⬩ This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000.

**__Mages overview__**
⬥ Mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%.
⬥ Each mage has 10,000 health and possesses a max hit of around 850. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name.

Nex has 5 phases; Smoke, Shadow, Blood, Ice, and Zaros. Each phase has 2 special attacks, with the exception of Zaros

__**Notes before the fight**__
.
⬥ Try and Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> as close to 10 seconds on the kill timer.
⬥ The easiest way to kite Nex (only whilst she is attempting to melee you) is to move as a horse/knight does in chess (or in the shape of an L), then continuing. If you are having trouble with this, then another legitimate method is to flail your mouse and continuously click (this will be less effective but can stall her a good amount).

__**Smoke phase notes**__
⬥ Vulnerability bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> Nex either just before she is attackable (12.0s on the boss kill timer) or during the early stages of the smoke phase.
⬥ Utilize <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:frag:535541273755385885> (move far away from Nex after using in order to double the damage of this ability) → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088>
    • Once she phases (160,000 HP) it's time for Fumus. Try to use bleeds (<:frag:535541273755385885> + <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> [if owned]). Save <:rapid:535541270521708566> for Shadow phase.
    • Using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> will be nice here to disallow Nex to stun you whilst you're killing Fumus.

.
__**Shadow phase notes**__
⬥ Be sure to switch to protect range <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>.
⬥ Utilize <:rapid:535541270521708566> → improvise strong abilities (try and save <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> for blood if you can).
    • Once she phases (120,000 HP), it's time for Umbra. Try to kill him in the exact same way as you killed Fumus previously (including the saving of <:rapid:535541270521708566>).

.
__**Blood phase notes**__
⬥ Be sure to switch back to protect magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.
⬥ Throw another Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Be sure to switch to your range helmet and gloves if you're using the melee armour strategy.
    • Try to <:snipe:535541258425204770> as her wings reach their highest point or after. Utilize <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.
    • Once she phases (80,000 HP), your next target is Crour. Dispatch of him the same way you did Fumus and Umbra with one potential difference. Using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and allowing yourself to do an auto attack is a good way to mitigate a good chunk of damage without sacrificing much/any damage you deal.

.
__**Ice phase notes**__
⬥ Utilize <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → good basics/lower damaging thresholds.
    • Once she phases (40,000 HP), it's time for the final minion, Glacies.
    • Use whatever you can to kill him as quickly as possible. <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Bleeds are an excellent way to deal lots of damage to him quickly to avoid any further prisons from Nex.

.
__**Zaros phase notes**__
⬥ Utilize <:rapid:535541270521708566> → good basics → <:deadshot:535541307666595870> → basics until you're able to <:rapid:535541270521708566> again. (Try to use low multiple-hitting, low damaging abilities such as bleeds as frequently as you can).
    • If you brought an Adrenaline Potion <:replen:634350514406162436>, use it after <:deadshot:535541307666595870> to use more thresholds before your second <:rapid:535541270521708566>.
