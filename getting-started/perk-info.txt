**__Precise 6 Aftershock 1 + Aftershock 4 Equilibrium 2__** <:p6:712073088769982475> <:as1:689502339891331093> + <:as4:712074245202772009> <:eq2:689502258424971564>
⬥ Approximately 9.6% DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all.
⬥ Precise 6 on mainhand boosts all Flank/Defender/Shield damage by approximately 6.9%.
⬥ Aftershock 1 on Mainhand ensures you maintain stacks even when using a switch, and also provides extra damage.
⬥ Gives effective Precise 6 + Equilibrium 2 + Aftershock 4 and is considerably cheaper than attempting to get P6e2 on one gizmo.
⬥ Best perk setup for places where Ruthless is unlikely to be effective.

.
**__Equilibrium 4 Ruthless 3__** <:eq4:712073088589627505> <:ruthless3:712244800572883025>
⬥ When comboed with p6as1 is approximately 8.3% DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all, before taking Ruthless into account.
⬥ Cheap to obtain.
⬥ Very good at places where Ruthless is effective - e.g. Elite Dungeons, Slayer, Legiones, Chinning AoD etc.

.
**__Lunging 4__** <:lung4:712073737247260753>
⬥ Increases max hit of Dismember, Fragmentation Shot and Combust by +80% on stationary targets.
⬥ Reduces the damage of walked Fragmentation Shot and Combust to only 1.5x base damage, rather than the usual 2x.
⬥ Generally only used with melee as you cannot walk Dismember, Frag Shot/Combust are better if walked without lunging.

**__Biting 3__** <:b3:689502516874051590>

⬥ Very cheap and easy to obtain.
⬥ Approximately a 3.8% DPM boost over not having any form of biting.

⬥ Can easily be comboed with an auxiliary perk.

.
**__Enhanced Devoted 4__** <:enhdev4:712073087507628035>
⬥ Enhanced Devoted 4 has a 18% (19.8% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
⬥ The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 18% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 30.5% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
⬥ This takes priority over the normal Devoted perk, however the normal Devoted perk can activate during the time Enhanced devotion is active
⬥ Putting this perk along with Crackling 3 on the legs allows us to use armour switches with different setups at a lower cost since they are generally cheaper.

.
**__Turtling 4__** <:turt4:712073737377284146>

⬥ Relentless 5 gives a 5% (5.5% at level 20) chance to not consume adrenaline when using an ability that requires adrenaline
⬥ This includes thresholds, defensives, special attacks and ultimate abilites
⬥ Crackling 4 deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds
⬥ As Biting is expensive, and Relentless is a perk useful in all situations, putting them both on the body allows us to use different augmented legs with different perk setups.

.

⬥ Due to the lack of enhanced devoted it is preferred to combo Impatient 4 with Devoted 4.
⬥ Can be comboed with other perks if you opt to use Enhanced Devoted as well.
⬥ Devoted 4 has a 12% (13.2% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
