> **__ Weapon Perks__**
⬥ **__Entry Level__**
    • **Precise 6 + Equilibrium 4**
        - Approximately a `7.1%` DPM (damage per minute) increase over not having any weapon perks at all.
        - Super cheap to obtain once you've unlocked Ancient Gizmos.
        - Don't have to worry about maintaining aftershock stacks when using switches such as a shield or Guthix Staff spec.
        - Precise 6 on mainhand to maximise damage while using a shield/defender/flanking switch.
.tag:weaponentry
    • **Flanking 4**
        - Multiplies the damage of Backhand, Impact and Binding Shot by 2.6x when the target is not facing you.
        - Multiplies the damage of Forceful Backhand, Deep Impact and Tight Bindings by 1.6x when the target is not facing you.
        - Removes the stun effect from these abilities if the target is not facing you.
        - Still quite cheap and common for the benefit it gives.
        - For more information on Flanking Perk Angle see <#689212192398114875>.

    • **Planted Feet**
        - Increases the duration of Sunshine and Death's Swiftness from 30s (50 ticks) to 37.8s (63 ticks).
        - Usually comboed with Aftershock 1 on mainhand to preserve stacks.
.
⬥ **__Advanced__**
    • **Precise 6 Aftershock 1 + Aftershock 4 Equilibrium 2**
        - Approximately `9.6%` DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all.
        - Precise 6 on mainhand boosts all Flank/Defender/Shield damage by approximately `6.9%`.
        - Aftershock 1 on Mainhand ensures you maintain stacks even when using a switch, and also provides extra damage.
        - Gives effective Precise 6 + Equilibrium 2 + Aftershock 4 and is considerably cheaper than attempting to get P6e2 on one gizmo.
        - Best perk setup for places where Ruthless is unlikely to be effective.
.tag:weaponadvanced
    • **Equilibrium 4 Ruthless 3**
        - When comboed with p6as1 is approximately `8.3%` DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all, before taking Ruthless into account.
        - Cheap to obtain.
        - Very good at places where Ruthless is effective - e.g. Elite Dungeons, Slayer, Legiones, Chinning AoD etc.
.
    • **Lunging 4**
        - Increases max hit of Dismember, Fragmentation Shot and Combust by +80% on stationary targets.
        - Reduces the damage of walked Fragmentation Shot and Combust to only 1.5x base damage, rather than the usual 2x.
        - Generally only used with melee as you cannot walk Dismember, Frag Shot/Combust are better if walked without lunging.

> **__ Armour Perks__**
⬥ **__Entry Level__**
    • **Biting 3 **
        - Biting 3 gives a 6% (6.6% at level 20) chance of forcing a crit each hit, this come out to an average hit increase of 3.8% (4.18% at level 20).
        - Very cheap and easy to obtain.
        - Approximately a `3.8%` DPM boost over not having any form of biting.
    • **Impatient 4 **
        - Impatient 4 has a 36% (39.6% at level 20) chance to grant 3% more adren for a basic.
        - On average this means an increase of ~1 adrenaline per basic ability.
.tag:armourentry
    • **Crackling 4**
        - Crackling 4 deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds.
        - Can easily be comboed with an auxiliary perk.
    • **Enhanced Devoted 4**
        - Enhanced Devoted 4 has a 18% (19.8% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
        - The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 18% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 30.5% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
        - This takes priority over the normal Devoted perk, however the normal Devoted perk can activate during the time Enhanced devotion is active
        - Putting this perk along with Crackling 3 on the legs allows us to use armour switches with different setups at a lower cost since they are generally cheaper.
.
    • **Turtling 4**
        - Increases the duration and cooldown of Barricade by 40%
        - This allows for barricade to last for 13.8s (23 ticks), or 17.4s (29 ticks) if you have the T2 Malletops perk

.
⬥ **__Advanced__**
    • **Biting 4 X**
        - Biting 4 gives a 8% (8.8% at level 20) chance of forcing a crit each hit, this come out to an average hit increase of 5% (5.5% at level 20)
        - Approximately a `5%` DPM boost over not having Biting.
        - Can be comboed with an auxiliary perk but is generally expensive to do so
    • **Relentless 5 Crackling 4**
        - Relentless 5 gives a 5% (5.5% at level 20) chance to not consume adrenaline when using an ability that requires adrenaline
        - This includes thresholds, defensives, special attacks and ultimate abilites
        - Crackling 4 deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds
        - As Biting is expensive, and Relentless is a perk useful in all situations, putting them both on the body allows us to use different augmented legs with different perk setups.
.tag:armouradvanced
    • **Impatient 4 Devoted 4**
        - Due to the lack of enhanced devoted it is preferred to combo Impatient 4 with Devoted 4.
        - Can be comboed with other perks if you opt to use Enhanced Devoted as well.
        - Devoted 4 has a 12% (13.2% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
        - The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 12% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 21.4% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
    • **Invigorating 4 X**
        - Invigorating 4 gives 40% increased adrenaline from auto attacks, the amount depends on the combat style and weapon speed used. For mage this is always 0.8%.
        - Invigorating can be comboed with several things, this can allow for a mobile switch for barge when you want the shorter cooldown.
        - Most impactful for Mage setups but can be beneficial for all if you use freedom a lot.
