    ⬥ **__Entry Level__**
        • **Precise 6 + Equilibrium 4**
            - Approximately a `7.1%` DPM (damage per minute) increase over not having any weapon perks at all.
            - Super cheap to obtain once you've unlocked Ancient Gizmos.
            - Don't have to worry about maintaining aftershock stacks when using switches such as a shield or Guthix Staff spec.
            - Precise 6 on mainhand to maximise damage while using a shield/defender/flanking switch.

        • **Flanking 4**
            - Multiplies the damage of Backhand, Impact and Binding Shot by 2.6x when the target is not facing you.

            - Removes the stun effect from these abilities if the target is not facing you.
            - Still quite cheap and common for the benefit it gives.
            - For more information on Flanking Perk Angle see <#689212192398114875>.

        • **Planted Feet**

            - Usually comboed with Aftershock 1 on mainhand to preserve stacks.

    ⬥ **__Advanced__**
        • **Precise 6 Aftershock 1 + Aftershock 4 Equilibrium 2**
            - Approximately `9.6%` DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all.
            - Precise 6 on mainhand boosts all Flank/Defender/Shield damage by approximately `6.9%`.
            - Aftershock 1 on Mainhand ensures you maintain stacks even when using a switch, and also provides extra damage.
            - Gives effective Precise 6 + Equilibrium 2 + Aftershock 4 and is considerably cheaper than attempting to get P6e2 on one gizmo.
            - Best perk setup for places where Ruthless is unlikely be effective.
.tag:weaponadvanced
        • **Equilibrium 4 Ruthless 3**
            - When comboed with p6as1 is approximately `8.3%` DPM boost over not having any weapon perks at all, before taking Ruthless into account.
            - Cheap to obtain.
            - Very good at places where Ruthless is effective - e.g. Elite Dungeons, Slayer, Legiones, Chinning AoD etc.
.
        • **Lunging 4**
            - Increases max hit of Dismember, Fragmentation Shot and Combust by +80% on stationary targets.
            - Reduces the damage of walked Fragmentation Shot and Combust to only 1.5x base damage, rather than the usual 2x.
            - Generally only used with melee as you cannot walk Dismember, Frag Shot/Combust are better if walked without lunging.

.tag:armourentry
        • **Crackling 4**
            - Crackling 4 deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds.
            - Can easily be comboed with an auxiliary perk.
        • **Enhanced Devoted 4**
            - Enhanced Devoted 4 has a 18% (19.8% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
            - The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 18% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 30.5% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
            - This takes priority over the normal Devoted perk, however the normal Devoted perk can activate during the time Enhanced devotion is active
            - Putting this perk along with Crackling 3 on the legs allows us to use armour switches with different setups at a lower cost since they are generally cheaper.
.
        • **Turtling 4**
            - Increases the duration and cooldown of Barricade by 40%

            - Approximately a `3.6%` DPM boost over not having Biting.
            - Can be comboed with an auxiliary perk but is generally expensive to do so
        • **Relentless 5 Crackling 4**
            - Relentless 5 gives a 5% (5.5% at level 20) chance to not consume adrenaline when using an ability that requires adrenaline
            - This includes thresholds, defensives and ultimate abilites
            - Crackling 4 deals 200% ability damage every 60 seconds
            - As Biting is expensive, and Relentless is a perk useful in all situations, putting them both on the body allows us to use different augmented legs with different perk setups.
.tag:armouradvanced
        • **Impatient 4 Devoted 4**
            - Due to the lack of enhanced devoted it is preferred to combo Impatient 4 with Devoted 4.
            - Can be comboed with other perks if you opt to use Enhanced Devoted as well.
            - Devoted 4 has a 12% (13.2% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion ability.
            - The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 12% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 21.4% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
        • **Invigorating 4 X**
            - Invigorating 4 gives 40% increased adrenaline from auto attacks, the amount depends on the combat style and weapon speed used. For mage this is always 0.8%.
            - Invigorating can be comboed with several things, this can allow for a mobile switch for barge when you want the shorter cooldown.
            - Most impactful for Mage setups but can be beneficial for all if you use freedom a lot.
