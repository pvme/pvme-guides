⬥ Don't have to worry about maintaining Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> stacks when using switches such as a shield or Guthix Staff spec <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028>.
⬥ Precise 6 <:p6:712073088769982475> on mainhand to maximise damage while using a Flank/Defender/Shield <:flank4:712073088296157185>/<:kalphiterepriser:643846849362657280>/<:vengeful_kiteshield:536258767344500746> switch.

⬥ Multiplies the damage of Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>, Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> and Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> by 2.6x when the target is not facing you.
⬥ Multiplies the damage of Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>, Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> and Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> by 1.6x when the target is not facing you.

⬥ Aftershock 1 <:as1:689502339891331093> on Mainhand ensures you maintain stacks even when using a switch, and also provides extra damage.

⬥ Best perk setup for places where Ruthless <:ruthless3:712244800572883025> is unlikely to be effective.

.

⬥ Generally only used with melee as you cannot walk Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>, Frag Shot/Combust <:frag:535541273755385885>/<:comb:535533833098100745> are better if walked without lunging.

**__Biting 3__** <:b3:689502516874051590>

⬥ Very cheap and easy to obtain.
⬥ Approximately a 3.8% DPM boost over not having any form of Biting <:biting4:712073087809617931>.

**__Crackling 4__** <:crack4:712073087662686249>

**__Enhanced Devoted 4__** <:enhdev4:712073087507628035>
⬥ Enhanced Devoted 4 <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> has a 18% (19.8% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability.
⬥ The effectiveness of this depends on the attack speed of a boss, but leads to approximately 18% damage reduction on targets with an attack speed of greater than 4t, or 30.5% on targets with an attack speed of 4t, assuming you always have the correct overhead prayer on.
⬥ This takes priority over the normal Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perk, however the normal Devoted <:dev4:712073087713280033> perk can activate during the time Enhanced Devotion <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> is active

.
**__Impatient 4 Devoted 4__** <:imp4:712073088204013640> <:dev4:712073087713280033> 
⬥ Due to the lack of Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> it is preferred to combo Impatient 4 <:imp4:712073088204013640> with Devoted 4 <:dev4:712073087713280033> .
⬥ Can be comboed with other perks if you opt to use Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> as well.
⬥ Devoted 4 <:dev4:712073087713280033> has a 12% (13.2% at level 20) chance per hit on you of activating a 3 second version of the Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> ability.

.
**__Invigorating 4 X__** <:invig4:712073087859949570>
⬥ Invigorating 4 <:invig4:712073087859949570> gives 40% increased adrenaline from auto attacks, the amount depends on the combat style and weapon speed used. For Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> this is always 0.8%.
⬥ Invigorating <:invig4:712073087859949570> can be comboed with several things, this can allow for a Mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> switch for Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> when you want the shorter cooldown.
⬥ Most impactful for Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> setups but can be beneficial for all if you use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> a lot.
