This 👏 path isn't set ➿ in 👇 stone. Everyone learns in 🔫 different ways; however 🤔🤔 this is 🔥😩 a 👏👏 decent route to 🤔 follow. Additionally, the 🗣🍒 encounters listed are 😩⚛ from a 👌😾 solo 🎸😏 perspective, as 🏿 group 🅱🅱 encounter requirements can 💦 be 🐝 much more 🙈 vague.

Initial 💰💰 combat 🗡 experience 😋 can 🙅 be gained by doing general ♂ Slayer. This 👇 can 🤔 be 🐝👨 used 🙄👨 to get the hang of 💦👶 the 🎁 abilties and what ⏰ they 😅 do. You 👆♀ can also take this 👋👈 chance 😨🚫 to 💦💦 get 💲🉐 used 🎶🎶 to some ⏳ keybinds, as you 👐👀 can go ♂ at 🍪 your own ☯ pace during 🚣🚣 Slayer. Alternatively, you 🏆😫 may 🕳🗓 practice 🍆🍆 on 🔛 a 🏿👌 dummy, 😘😘 though 💥🔥 you 🙇🎷 won't gain 🔑 any 💦 XP or 🚪💁 GP.

**__Araxxi__** <:Mallory:513212580148543489>
