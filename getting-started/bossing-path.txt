**__Bossing Path (All credit to Pernix)__**
This path isn't set in stone, everyone learns in differnt ways however this is a decent path to follow

⬥ Initial combat experience can be gained by doing general slayer. This can be used to get a hang of the abilties and what they do. You can also take this chance to get used to some keybinds as you can go at your own pace during slayer. Alternatively you may practice on a dummy however you won't gain any exp or gp.

⬥ <:Twin_Fury:513213159209828373> <:TwinFury:513212995892019211>  **Twin Furies** *__69 <:Ranged:689504724403486920> minimum, boost it to 80 with Grand Ranging Potion__*
They'll teach you movement, reflexes, doing a good amount of damage while keeping your health up and if you wish, get you started with Defensive abilities + switches.

She'll teach you how to do a decent amount of damage, increased reflexes, movement, further your knowledge of Defensive abilities and switching. If you wish, you can start practicing prayer flicking here.

⬥ <:Gregorovic:513212998274383914>  **Gregorovic** *__80 Prayer required__*
He'll force you to move around properly, do a decent amount of damage, remember his special's rotations while working around them in any way you find possible. Further increases your reflexes if you decide to prayer flick here and utilise Defensives.

.
⬥ At this point you can try any group boss you can access if you want, **preferably** <:Beastmaster_Durzag:513212996948983809> Beastmaster Durzag; *__Requirements set by group__*

⬥ <:Nex:513213159071547395>  **Nex** *__Frozen Key required__*
She'll be a test of how rapid you can react to the fight.
   
⬥ <:Mallory:513212580148543489>  **Araxxi** __*None*__
*The most common milestone for a player getting into PvM. This boss has punishing mechanics to those who tend to be unaware of their surroundings and their own abilities. Fighting this boss will let you practice:*

• Prayer Flicking.
• Greatly accelerate your training if you are on Full Manual.
• Greatly improve your improvisation techniques for dealing with **any** PvM mechanics you may encounter.
• Significantly improve the speed of your reactions.

*It's highly recommended (obviously not required) that you get some experience in her basics before attempting Araxxi with a partner, this is due to the overwhelming amount of information to take in during both types of fights and learning how to improvise while staying calm.*

⬥ <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> **Elite Dungeons | Solo Runs** *__Completion of Impressing the Locals for Temple of Aminishi__*
An endurance test of keeping damage up throughout the dungeons, all three Elite dungeons are a challenge to do properly and rapidly. They'll teach you how to use Bladed Dive and Surge, and how to kill and handle a large number of enemies at once. Due to the nature of these runs, their difficulty exponentially increases the faster and better you want them to be done.

⬥ <:Telos:513212949033123840>  **Telos** *__Defeat every general in the Heart of Gielinor to obtain the Ancient Sigil__*
