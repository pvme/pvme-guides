.tag:bossing
This path isn't set in stone. Everyone learns in different ways; however this is a decent route to follow. Additionally, the encounters listed are from a solo perspective, as group encounter requirements can be much more vague.

Initial combat experience can be gained by doing general Slayer. This can be used to get the hang of the abilties and what they do. You can also take this chance to get used to some keybinds, as you can go at your own pace during Slayer. Alternatively, you may practice on a dummy, though you won't gain any XP or GP.

**__Araxxi__** <:Mallory:513212580148543489>
