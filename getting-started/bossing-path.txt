**__Bossing Path (All credit to <@401918445429587969>)__**
This path isn't set in stone, everyone learns in different ways however this is a decent route to follow. Additionally, the encounters listed are from a solo perspective, as group bosses are far more vague to determine the next step ahead.

⬥ Initial combat experience can be gained by doing general slayer. This can be used to get a hang of the abilties and what they do. You can also take this chance to get used to some keybinds as you can go at your own pace during slayer. Alternatively you may practice on a dummy however you won't gain any XP or GP.

⬥ <:Twin_Fury:513213159209828373> <:TwinFury:513212995892019211>  **Twin Furies** *__69 <:Ranged:689504724403486920> minimum, boost it to 80 with a Grand Ranging Potion__*
They'll teach you movement, reflexes, doing a good amount of damage while keeping your health up and if you wish, get you started with basic Defensive usage.

⬥ <:Vindicta:513212949385445376>  **Vindicta** *__69 <:Attack:689509250472476758> minimum, boost it to 80 with a Grand Attack Potion__*
The most commonly used benchmark for basic combat training. You may learn basic ability priorization and basic defensive usage. Difficulty and potential learning experience can be improved by adding Soul Split flicking and faster killing methods.

⬥ <:Helwyr:513213019635843100>  **Helwyr** *__69 <:Magic:689504724159823906> minimum, boost it to 80 with a Grand Magic Potion__*
He'll teach you how to be precise in your movements and abilities, increases your reflexes.

⬥ <:Gregorovic:513212998274383914>  **Gregorovic** *__80 Prayer required__*
He'll force you to move around properly, do a decent amount of damage, remember his special's rotations while working around them in any way you find possible. Significantly improves reaction times if you choose to flick Soul Split here.

.
⬥ At this point you can try any group boss you can access if you want, **preferably** <:Beastmaster_Durzag:513212996948983809> Beastmaster Durzag; *__Requirements set by group__*

⬥ <:Nex:513213159071547395>  **Nex** *__Frozen Key required__*
A difficult encounter for those who've begun their transition into manual. You'll master precise movement and ideal abilities to use at specific times. An ideal fight to master Full Manual.
   
⬥ <:Mallory:513212580148543489>  **Araxxi** __*None*__
*The most common milestone for a player getting into PvM. This boss has punishing mechanics to those who tend to be unaware of their surroundings and their own abilities. Fighting this boss will let you practice:*

    • Prayer flicking
    • Greatly accelerate your training if you are on Full Manual
    • Greatly improve your overall PvM improvisation techniques
    • Significantly improve the speed of your reactions

*It's highly recommended (obviously not required) that you get some experience in her basics before attempting Araxxi with a partner, this is due to the overwhelming amount of information to take in during both types of fights and learning how to improvise while staying calm.*

⬥ <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Seiryu:583430543321071626>  **Elite Dungeons | Solo Runs** *__Completion of Impressing the Locals for Temple of Aminishi__*
An endurance test of keeping damage up throughout the dungeons, all three Elite dungeons are a challenge to do properly and rapidly. They'll teach you how to use Bladed Dive and Surge, and how to kill and handle a large number of enemies at once. Due to the nature of these runs, their difficulty exponentially increases the faster and better you want them to be done.

⬥ <:raksha:789813907706478603>  **Raksha | Solo/Duo** *__Requires completion of the Raksha, the Shadow Colossus miniquest__*

    • Reactionary prayer flicking
    • Use of precise movement
    • Accurate clicking for Bladed Dive
    • Good fight to practice long-term Ranged ability rotations
