.tag:introduction
This path isn't set in stone. Everyone learns in different ways; however, this is a decent route to follow. Additionally, the encounters listed are from a solo perspective, as group encounter requirements can be much more vague.

Initial combat experience can be gained by doing general Slayer at your own pace. This can be used to get the hang of combat abilties and what they do. You can also take this chance to get used to some keybinds. Alternatively, you may practice on a dummy, though you won't gain any XP or GP, and the dummy doesn't fight back!

**__Arch-Glacor__**
Arguably the best boss for overall learning, Arch-Glacor provides a customizable bossing experience. In normal mode, the player may turn mechanics on and off in order to learn them at their own pace. Once comfortable with a few mechanics, the player can turn many mechanics on at once to test their knowledge. In hard mode, all mechanics are enabled, with a few changes, and survivability becomes more of a challenge. In general, it is recommended to start on normal mode, progress through the mechanics, and work up to unlocking & successfully completing a hard mode kill.

*Note: For a detailed overview of Arch-Glacor's mechanics, please read <#1020357624476221520>*

**__GWD2: the Heart of Gielinor__**
While not providing as flexible of an experience as Arch-Glacor, these four bosses can provide a host of learning opportunities. They offer their own lessons, and can help keep the learning process fresh, rather than just camping Arch-Glacor. In general, the difficulty of the bosses making up the GWD2 area are (approximately) ranked as follows, from easiest to most difficult:

⬥ Vindicta & Gorvek (requires 80 <:Attack:689509250472476758> - boostable)
⬥ Twin Furies (requires 80 <:Ranged:689504724403486920> - boostable)
⬥ Helwyr (requires 80 <:Magic:689504724159823906> - boostable)
⬥ Gregorovic (requires 80 <:prayer:1005450651347730533>)

**__Araxxor__**
A very common milestone for those looking to advance into higher-tier PvM. With more complex mechanics, it will tend to punish players who are unaware of their surroundings or ability usage. It is highly recommended to learn in **solo**, as duo is much more challenging.

**__Araxxi__** <:Mallory:513212580148543489>
The most common milestone for a player getting into higher PvM. This boss has punishing mechanics to those who tend to be unaware of their surroundings and ability usage.
