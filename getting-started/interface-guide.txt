Having 🍽😸 a 😠 proper interface setup is 🔥💦 important as it allows you 🚫👨 to 🏼💰 organize your game 🎮🕹 view 🤓 and 🕋🏽 have 🈶 quick, 🍆🛀 convenient access to 👀👆 game 🎮🎮 windows that 🤓😐 you 👇 frequently ☣☣ interact 👉 with 💦👏 such ❤📶 as inventory, gear, ability bars, etc.

.
> **__Uses of Tertiary Action Bars:__**
.tag:tert
Tertiary action 🤚 bars 😂😂 can 🔫 be 💎 used 🎶🚟 as 🏿🕐 a 🅰🅱 quick 😐🏃 access 🚪 tool for many ❔ things. 🕑
⬥ Condense ability 👉👉 books 🔥 (i.e. Defensives and 👏 Prayers).
    • Having prayers 🙏🙏 and 🚫 defensive abilities on an ability bar 🥃🍻 is 💦🔥 handy because 🏽👏 it lets 🚟👀 you 👩😇 only 🏻🕦 see what you 👉😀 need rather than 🙅 trying to 💦🎦 find ✔ the ⏩👏 ability/prayer you 🎵😩 want 👏 out of the 👏 whole 👧👧 book. 📖🐳
⬥ Keybind extra actions ♂ (i.e. ➡ Food 🍕🍛 and Prayers). 🏽🙏
    • This 👁👈 is useful because 😡🙌 it 🍆😽 makes it 💯🐈 easier 😀 to 👂 eat 😋🍱 or 😇 flick prayers while 🕗🤔 you 😊 are 💯 busy moving and/or 🚫🚫 reacting to mechanics 💰💰 with 🙀 your 🔫 mouse.
⬥ Have 👏👨 stuff 🔝 that 🏻 are ♀🚟 used with 😶↔ every 🚫 style 🐶🐶 so 👌💏 that 🗝👈 the ✝🏠 main bar has 🅰👏 more 📈 room 🛫😈 (i.e. 💰👀 Food, Mobility abilities, Constitution abilities).
    • Again, 👀😱 having 😋 a universal ability 👉👉 bar 😫🥃 with 😶👀 food 🍆🍝 and 💰 abilities that apply 😤 to ⏸🔬 all 🦊 combat styles is important so 💯 you 🏼 can always 🕰 have 🙌👏 access 🚪🚪 to ♂😥 what 😅🙏 you 🤖 need 😂 regardless 🤷🤷 of what combat 🏹♂ style 🐶 is 💦 being 😑🐝 used. 🆒
⬥ Fill remaining 🕵 empty 💨📦 slots with 🕺 niche 👩👩 stuff 👏
    • Example: full 💯 gear switches for 👏⌛ Solak hybridding, quick 😫 access to abilities/inputs for 👏🕒 Ingenuity of 😎 the ⚰👏 Humans 😏 + Seren Godbow special attack, ⚔🤼 etc.
⬥ Weapon ⚔ and Shield 💦 keybinds if 🤔 using 🏻🏻 an 😙 MMO mouse
    • You 👈👉 can 🙅 remap the buttons of 🌊 an 🔞👹 MMO mouse 🐭 to some hard to 😫💰 reach ♀ buttons 🖱 on ⏪ a keyboard ⌨⌨ to ✌ effectively give 🅱 yourself 🏼 more keybinds.

.
> __**Creating an Interface**__
.tag:start
⬥ Creating 👏👏 a ✝👌 good 👌 interface is 💦💦 all about displaying your 👏🏻 game 💻 windows in 💦🙏 a way ✋ where everything 🙌😡 you 👈 need to 😂 access is open 🌊📭 and 🌈👅 are close to 💦 each 👏 other 👪 so 😂 you 🙋 can minimize the 💦 distance your ✊🅱 eyes 👁👁 and ➕😍 mouse 🐭🐭 need to 😂🎲 travel ✈ around your 👯🅱 screen. 

**__RS3 Default Interface__**

.
There 😩 are a 👌👌 lot of 😜 things 💍👀 wrong 🙅 with this ❓ interface. Game windows are spread 🙌 across the 💦🍑 screen on 🔛🔛 corners 📦📦 and 👏 most 👉💯 of the 💍 space 😫 is 💦 unused.

This is 🐶 not ♂🌪 a 🎩👌 horrible foundation for 🍆💰 an 😒😯 interface, but 😈 there 🚬 are 🐓 some easy improvements that 🆚 can be 🐝 made. 💰🛠
⬥ Just by reorganizing a bit and 👌 adding the 👩 ability 👉 book 📚👏 with ⛹😶 all ♂ ability 👉 tabs adds some 🤷😋 quick 💦😫 access, and 🎅🏻 with 😍 the 🏼 addition ➕➕ of 👸 focusing 🤓 all 👀 of 🅱 the 👇 game 🎮🖥 windows towards ⛪ the 🍆🔝 bottom right, 🔫 the interface is 🙀🅰 much 🙄😍 more 🍗 optimized.
⬥ The 👏 interface is 💦 organized in 💦 a 👌👌 way ↕ where 😈 everything on 💡 screen 🖥🖥 is 🈶💦 important, ❌✅ but 🍑 the 👏 more ⬆ you 👨 need to interact 👌 with 🙅👏 something, the 🌎🙀 more ➕🙅 it 💯 is 💦👏 focused towards ⛪ that bottom ⬇⬇ right 💩💍 corner
    • For 🎅🏽 example, 🔥 chat 🏿 boxes 🤒 aren't as 🏿💰 important, 🤣😍 so they 👥😅 are ♀ farther away from the 🔥 essential corner. ⤵💀 Gear and inventory tabs are 😎🚟 heavily 💦 interacted with, so 💯 they ♀ are 🍆😟 at 🍆 the 👏🔍 focal point of the interfaces here. 🔪💪

⬥ Switching the 👏🅱 ribbon into Edit Mode can be 😌🏻 done 😰😩 by 🚟 clicking on 👌👇 the icon 🔔🔔 with 👏🅱 a 😜💰 box 😂📦 and a 💦 pencil. 
⬥ Editing the 👏💰 buttons on 🔛 the 😂👏 ribbon can 💦 be 👬🚫 done 😩 by 🍄 clicking on 🔛➡ the 🕜 cog icon. 🔔 
⬥ Inventory dimensions can be 🌼 customized by 🏳 going 🏃💦 to Settings → Gameplay → General ♂ → Inventory → Dynamic backpack columns.*

⬥ Split 🚻🚻 private 🕵🕵 chat 🙇 can 🔫💰 be 👌 turned on 👇 in Settings → Gameplay → Social 📖 → Chat 🏿💬 Customization → Split private 🕵🕵 chat.

⬥ The 👏 Buff 💪💪 and 🙏👑 Debuff bars 🔥 are 😠🏼 extremely 👌 important 🤣✅ in 👏 PvM. Having 👉 them in a practical place 🏡 close 😍 to 😖 the middle of 👪 the 🌧 screen where 🤷🤔 your 🤗 attention will 🍑 mostly 🙋💆 be 🐝📖 is 💦😍 important. ✅😍
⬥ The 🦉 chatbox is set to 💦💵 NOT ❌ click-through. 
    • This ➡👇 setting 🌃 can 🛢🔫 be 🅱 found in 👏👏 Gameplay → General 👮👮 Interaction → Advanced 📕 Interactions → Click-through chatboxes.

.
**__Extra__**

.
The 👨 bank's 🏛🏛 length can 🔫 also ➕➕ be 👨 resized (the 👏 default is 🔥💯 very 💎 small).

At the end 🔚😣 of the 😅 day, 😏🏃 a 👌 good 👍👌 interface is 🚫💦 one 🏻😫 that 😐 works for 🍆 you. 👉 Look for 🐻🍆 common patterns in 👌 the 👏🅱 interfaces of good 👍👏 PvMers to see 👀👀 what 😟💣 aspects help 💁 them PvM.
