Having a proper interface setup is important as it allows you to organize your game view and have quick, convenient access to game windows that you frequently interact with such as inventory, gear, ability bars, etc.

> **__Uses of Tertiary Action Bars:__**
.tag:tert
Tertiary action bars can be used as a quick access tool for many things.
⬥ Condense ability books (i.e. Defensives and Prayers).
    • Having prayers and defensive abilities on an ability bar is handy because it lets you only see what you need rather than trying to find the ability/prayer you want out of the whole book.
⬥ Keybind extra actions (i.e. Food and Prayers).
    • This is useful because it makes it easier to eat or flick prayers while you are busy moving and/or reacting to mechanics with your mouse.
⬥ Have stuff that are used with every style so that the main bar has more room (i.e. Food, Mobility abilities, Constitution abilities).
    • Again, having a universal ability bar with food and abilities that apply to all combat styles is important so you can always have access to what you need regardless of what combat style is being used.
⬥ Fill remaining empty slots with niche stuff
    • Example: full gear switches for Solak hybridding, quick access to abilities/inputs for Ingenuity of the Humans + Seren Godbow special attack, etc.
⬥ Weapon and Shield keybinds if using an MMO mouse
    • You can remap the buttons of an MMO mouse to some hard to reach buttons on a keyboard to effectively give yourself more keybinds.

.tag:start
⬥ Creating a good interface is all about displaying your game windows in a way where everything you need to access is open and are close to each other so you can minimize the distance your eyes and mouse need to travel around your screen.

There are a lot of things wrong with this interface. Game windows are spread across the screen on corners and most of the space is unused.

This is not a horrible foundation for an interface, but there are some easy improvements that can be made.
⬥ Just by reorganizing a bit and adding the ability book with all ability tabs adds some quick access, and with the addition of focusing all of the game windows towards the bottom right, the interface is much more optimized.
⬥ The interface is organized in a way where everything on screen is important, but the more you need to interact with something, the more it is focused towards that bottom right corner
    • For example, chat boxes aren't as important, so they are farther away from the essential corner. Gear and inventory tabs are heavily interacted with, so they are at the focal point of the interfaces here.

⬥ Switching the ribbon into Edit Mode can be done by clicking on the icon with a box and a pencil.
⬥ Editing the buttons on the ribbon can be done by clicking on the cog icon.
⬥ Inventory dimensions can be customized by going to Settings → Gameplay → General → Inventory → Dynamic backpack columns.*

⬥ The Buff and Debuff bars are extremely important in PvM. Having them in a practical place close to the middle of the screen where your attention will mostly be is important.
⬥ The chatbox is set to NOT click-through.
    • This setting can be found in Gameplay → Interfaces → Game Interaction → Click-through chatboxes.

The bank's length can also be resized (the default is very small).

At the end of the day, a good interface is one that works for you. Look for common patterns in the interfaces of good PvMers to see what aspects help them PvM.
