.tag:intro
The Invention skill is one of the best ways to increase your dpm very easily. As such, invention is an indispensible skill to have unlocked and trained. This guide will detail all aspects of the invention skill including its various uses and training methods.

.
> __**Starting Out**__
.tag:start
**__Requirements__**
Invention is the only elite skill in the game and requires the following to unlock.

⬥ 80 Smithing
⬥ 80 Crafting
⬥ 80 Divination

.
**__Unlocking Invention__**
⬥ First of all you want to go to the Invention guild located just north of Falador (around the Dwarven mines area).
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Bq1tAou.png
.
⬥ Next go to talk to the dwarf inside called Doc.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1u8quO8.png
.
⬥ Doc will walk you through a basic invention tutorial that shows you how to augment items.

.
> __**The Inventor's Workbench**__
.tag:workbench
This is where you'll manufacture most of the items invention gives you access to. Before you can create an item, you must have first discovered it (also at the workbench).
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/VcjjxMr.png
.
**__Using the Workbench__**
⬥ The right side of the bench can be clicked on to manufacture invention items.

⬥ The left side can be clicked on to discover invention items.

.
**__Discover Tab__**
This is the screen you'll see when you open the the _discover_ tab.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/L1xzFwg.png
.
⬥ The list on the left are blueprints for invention items.

⬥ You then choose 5 modules to build the prototype (right side of the screen) and through trial and error you'll get the correct combination. Once that's done you'll need to arrange the modules into the correct order.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/R5unsHe.png
.
    • You don't have to get the correct order to unlock the item but the correct order gives you a lot more xp (around 5 times more than a completely incorrect order).
    • You'll know when you have the correct order when the optimisation level reads perfect.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7q46xXN.png
.
⬥ Now that you've discovered a few items, you can get to making them using the right side of the workbench.

.
> __**Components**__
.tag:comps
These are items you use to create invention items. You get them by disassembling other items. You can disassemble items by dragging them onto the small lightbulb icon at the bottom of your inventory.

.
**__Understanding Components__**
⬥ You can check what components you have by clicking on the aforementioned icon.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/96igPYd.png
.
    • This is what your invention material pouch will look like (roughly) once you start collecting components.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/M0Oc0Ey.png
.
⬥ You have 4 main classifications for components: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Ancient.
    • Common and ancient components are mainly used to create items while uncommon, rare and ancient components are more used in gizmos for perks.

.
> __**Gizmos and Perks**__
.tag:gizmosperks
Gizmos are the main focus of invention. They allow you to put perks on your weapons, armour and tools which allow for some very useful effects during skilling or PvM.

.
**__Making Gizmos__**
⬥ There are separate gizmos for tools <:ancienttoolgizmo:697405383513473046>, weapons <:ancientweapongizmo:697405383752548382> and armour <:ancientarmourgizmo:697405383769194516> and each has to be discovered at the workbench.

⬥ Gizmos must first be made at the workbench. After creation, you can click on the gizmo to add components to it. This will produce various different perks, depending on the components used and their layout in the gizmo.

.
**__Adding Perks to Gizmos__**
⬥ You can put up to 2 perks into each gizmo. This is why most end-stage PvM perks are a combo of two perks as it maximises the number of perks you can have (e.g. crackling4 ruthless5).

⬥ You can put up to 2 gizmos on chest/leg armour or a 2h weapon for a total of 4 perks on each item.

⬥ Main hand and offhand weapons can only hold one gizmo (so only 2 perks).

⬥ An example of a gizmo would be:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/qNYb13Q.png
.
⬥ You can now click on various materials to add them to the gizmo
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/lpZ1nXp.png
.
⬥ Possible perks (lower right corner) shows you what perks you could get from creating the gizmo.

⬥ In the example's case it would be any combination of Biting 1/2/3 and Cautious. On creating the perk, Biting 2 and Cautious were obtained in the gizmo.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/H3qQ2F9.png
.
⬥ Perks that you get may not always be desirable so be prepared to use a lot of materials to repeat the process till you get the perks you want. Some perks (e.g. Biting) also have ranks (the number next to it). In general,  the higher the rank the better the version of the perk.

⬥ You can find information on the effect of relevant PvM perks in <#689236234912137266> and perk setups, costs and gizmo layout required to make those perks in <#553632787639435284>.

*Note: You should only aim to obtain end-stage perks at level 120 invention.*

.
**__Adding Gizmos to Items__**
⬥ To add a gizmo to an item, it must be augmented first. To augment an item, use an augmentor (either make one or buy one off the GE) on a piece of undegraded armour. Keep in mind that you can only augment t70+ weapons and armour (except hybrid armour for which only anima core of Sliske is augmentable).

⬥ On the other hand, if you wish to remove gizmos from or de-augment an item, you can use either a gizmo dissolver or an augmentation dissolver on the augmented item to produce the desired effect. These may be bought at the GE or created at the workbench.

⬥ You need divine charges to power augmented items. You can either create them at the workbench or buy them at the GE.

.
> __**Machines**__
.tag:machines
Towards the back of the invention guild you'll be able to create machines (starting at level 60). These machines can do some very handy stuff for you such as alching and disassembling items (meaning you don't have to spend hours at the GE).
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/GJdgL4N.png
.
If you click on an empty machine hotspot you'll see a list of the machines you are able to create, as well as the components/items required to create them.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/zufYzSW.png
.
As with everything related to invention, machines require divine charges to use. You can use divine charges on your generator (the big machine on the east in the first picture) and it will supply power to the rest of your machines.

.
> __**Ancient Invention**__
.tag:ancient
With the release of archaeology, ancient invention was introduced to the game. This included ancient tools (only difference between these and regular invention tools are that these are t80 instead of t70), but more excitingly, it introduced ancient gizmos as well as 4 new ancient components. Ancient gizmos have slots for 9 materials as opposed to the regular gizmo's 5 slots, thus allowing better perk ranks (and some completely new perks thanks to the new components).

Both the blueprints for ancient invention items as well as the ancient components are tradeable and can be bought on the GE.

Keep in mind though that as with regular gizmos, it's not worth going for high-end perks till 120 invention.

.
> __**How to Train Invention**__
.tag:training
Invention experience is obtained by siphoning or disassembling augmented items once you've levelled them up a bit.
As you gain experience with augmented items, they gain experience and level up. Higher tier items will give you more xp than lower tier items when at the same invention level.
For the purpose of training invention, since you gain combat experience much faster than skill experience, you should use combat to level up invention.

.
**__Weapons__**
⬥ 2H weapons experience gain = 0.6x total base combat experience gained while killing a monster with the augmented item equipped
⬥ MH weapons experience gain = 0.4x total base combat experience gained while killing a monster with the augmented item equipped
⬥ OH weapons experience gain = 0.2x total base combat experience gained while killing a monster with the augmented item equipped

.
**__Armour__**
⬥ Legs/Torso armour experience gain = 0.4x total base combat experience gained while killing a monster with the augmented item equipped

.
**__Training Methods__**
⬥ XP capacitors should be used at all levels of invention training as they provide a 2x boost to the rate at which items gain experience, thereby effectively doubling invention xp/hr. They can be bought on the Grand Exchange.

⬥ For lower levelled players, the Slayer skill is a very good way to gain both combat experience as well as invention experience.

⬥ For higher levelled players, the fastest way to train invention is to level items up in high level shattered worlds using the chin darkbow method. Alternatively you can continue gradually gaining item xp during combat (bossing/slayer) and siphoning/disassembling as appropriate.

⬥ You can find a more detailed guide at:

**Invention Training** - <https://runescape.wiki/w/Invention_training>

.
> **__Level Breakdown__**
.tag:level
**__Level 1-4__**
⬥ You'll get these doing the tutorial

.
**__Level 4-27__**
⬥ Research item maximum level 5

⬥ Buy any cheap augmentable weapon (crystal halberd or black salamanders for example) and level it up to level 5. Some of the best places to do this are ED3, the abyss and abyssal demons depending on what weapon you choose.

.
⬥ At level 16, research augmented armour. This will let you augment torso armour and increase your xp gains. Buy some cheap augmentable armour and level up to level 5.

⬥ When your weapons armour reach level 5, disassemble them for xp. Do this until you hit level 27.

.
**__Level 27-60__**
⬥ Research item maximum level 10.

⬥ Continue levelling up your cheap weapons and armour but now get them to level 10 before disassembling.

⬥ At level 45, research augmented leg armour. Buy some cheap augmentable leg armour and level it up along with your torso and weapon.

.
**__Level 60__**
⬥ Research item maximum level 15

⬥ Stop using your cheap gear. Augment your main gear and level it up. At level 12, siphon the items for xp. Repeat till you reach level 120.

.
> __**Extra Tips and Tricks**__
.tag:tt
**__Blueprints__**
⬥ Always use extreme invention pots (level 85 herblore) to be able to research blueprints up to 17 levels earlier. If you can't make extreme invention potions, use super invention potions instead. Using these you can research blueprints and build machines before you meet the actual level requirement.

⬥ For maximum invention xp, it's best to save discovering non-essential blueprints for Double XP Weekends.

.
**__Perks__**
⬥ Whenever disassembling items for components, make sure that they are at least level 9, since this provides 4x the base amount of components obtained.

⬥ Scavenging 3/4 is a very useful perk to have on a weapon/armour that you'll be using to farm trash mobs with a high kph. It will potentially save you 100s of millions in uncommon and rare (but mostly rare) components

⬥ When going for a specific perk, it's always a good idea to have a look at the wiki's perk calculator to help you figure out the optimal perk combination, invention level as well as the average cost before deciding whether to go for the perk that you have in mind.
