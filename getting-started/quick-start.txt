Welcome to <#592296784978509824>! This channel is meant to be a fast starter guide for newer players looking to get into RS3 PvM. It covers basic money making, early combat training, and short skilling guides. If ever in doubt, first check <https://runescape.wiki/>. If you are still unsure, feel free to ask questions in <#656898197561802760>.

.
> __**Money Making**__
.tag:money
The purpose of this section is to explain some methods in which you can make money to start buying gear as a low level player.
⬥ Assumes no main account.
⬥ If main account exists to transfer gp/purchase bonds, skip this section.

__**Vis Wax**__
Requires: 50 Runecrafting
Located in the Runecrafting Guild, you may activate this machine once per day and choose 3 runes to obtain up to 100 vis wax.
The first rune is identical for everyone; the second rune is chosen at random between 3 runes; the third rune is random (Runecrafting skill cape perk reveals this rune).
It is recommended to use cheap runes to obtain vis wax. Try to use any of the following: air, mind, earth, water, fire, body, chaos, death. Avoid combination runes at all costs.

__**Skilling Methods**__
⬥ Smithing Steel Bars
    • Do the quest __**The Knights Sword**__ to get the required smithing level. 
⬥ Making headless arrows.
⬥ Archaeology: Harvesting cache materials.

.
__**Other**__
⬥ Completing easy clues
    • They require almost no stats, yet can reward you with Fortunate Component-giving items worth ~800k-1m each. It is recommended to get at least 50 thieving and 40 agility should you plan to pickpocket H.A.M members for clues, however they are not required.

⬥ Collecting Zamorak mjolnirs
    • This method can be upwards of 4m/hr and has very little requirements. 
    • See this guide: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Finding_Zamorak_mjolnirs>

.
> __**Combat Training**__
.tag:combat
The purpose of this section is to break down, as simply as possible, a relatively efficient means of getting the stats required to begin bossing.
The goal is for you to end up with the following stats: 99 combat skills; 99 invention; 96 herblore; 95 prayer and 87/99 summoning.
Notes: 
⬥ You do not have to strictly follow this should your budget not allow you to do so.
⬥ Acquiring a charming imp as early as possible will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. You can find a server dedicated to this in <#536715031128309780> (EDTeams) or <#773365514348527626>.
⬥ Constitution and Defence are not listed as they can be trained alongside the other combat styles.
⬥ While not mentioned, you should always upgrade to the highest tier weapon and then power armour that you can afford when training. 
⬥ For melee specifically, a halberd is strongly recommended.

.
You have 2 main options when it comes to training combat: Elite Dungeon 3 trash runs and Slayer.

__**Elite Dungeons**__
ED3 trash runs offer the highest combat experience rates in the game. It is recommended to have some decently leveled gear (level 50+ in a trio should be fine), since exp gained is based on damage dealt. Find teams to do this with in the charming imp message above. The two most common methods are:
⬥ Elite Dungeons 3: all mobs up until the first boss
⬥ Elite Dungeons 1: first floor minibosses for farming dungeoneering tokens
    • It is highly recommended to have at least one experienced player in your group for the ED1 method, as the bosses can be quite dangerous. The ED3 method is more beginner friendly.

__**Slayer**__
Your second option is Slayer. While this offers less combat exp and gp/hr than EDs in the early levels, it comes with the benefit of leveling up a very lucrative skill in the future. It also provides a lot of charms for Summoning. A good way to train low level Slayer is crushing the corrupted scarabs that spawn in and around Menaphos.
For more inofrmation: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Corrupted_Scarab_(Menaphos)>
⬥ Your number one priority for Slayer is to complete the __**Smoking Kills**__ . This quest will double all your Slayer point rewards from completing tasks.
⬥ After that you should focus on obtaining a Full slayer helmet. This helm gives a large accuracy and damage boost against monsters you have a task for.

The following are methods to train if you do not wish to do either Slayer or Elite Dungeons. They are split up by style.

.
__**Attack and Strength**__
⬥ Note: __**The Grand Tree**__ quest gives a 18,750 experience lamp that you can use on either Ranged, Strength, Attack, Defence, Hp or Magic. It is recommended to complete this quest and use it on either Ranged or Magic.
    • 1-30: Do __**Waterfall Quest**__.
    • 30-36:Do __**The Fight Arena**__ quest (Attack only).
    • 30-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves.
    • 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum.
        - Do: __**Regicide**__ for access to the Dragon Halberd.
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss.
    • Alternatively: 70-90: Guthan's at Hellhounds.
    • 90-99: Either Wilderness Abyss or Waterfiends.


__**Ranged**__
⬥ It is important to make use of the highest tier Chinchompa you are able to wield when training ranged in the abyss.
⬥ Unlock <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> ability ASAP.
    • 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves.
    • 0-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum.
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss with chinchompas.
    • 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms).

.
__**Magic**__
⬥ Unlock <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> ability ASAP.
    • 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves.
        - At 30 magic you have the magic level for Evil Dave's Big day out, it is recommended to do this quest should you have the stats as it gives 50,000 magic experience.
    • 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum.
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss.
    • 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms).

.
> __**Skills Training**__
.tag:skills
__**Prayer**__
⬥ Once you reach 70 prayer you can make use of the Piety variants of prayers, allowing you access to a relatively decent damage-boosting prayer to start bossing with. It is recommended to do this so you can fund 95 prayer more easily.
    • 1-27: Do: __**Restless Ghost**__; __**Priest in Peril**__; __**One Piercing Note**__, and then __**God Statues**__ monthly d&d.
    • 27-95: Dragon bones on gilded altar with 2 lit burners OR wilderness chaos altar (this should cost ~70m, but make sure to check current prices).

.
__**Summoning**__
This section assumes you have already done either 90-99 Ranged, Magic, Strength or Attack at Waterfiends and therefore have the gold and crimson charms needed for 87
⬥ Making use of the Familiarisation minigame will greatly aid in farming charms from Waterfiends.
⬥ Charming potions increase the number of charms dropped per kill by 1 for every mob, purchasable from the Grand Exchange, and highly recommended when training combat via ED3, as the blue charms can be used to accelerate your Summoning training.  
⬥ While this list works for the most part, you can always use a calculator or the Summoning training page on the wiki for a more detailed walkthrough.
    • 1-4 : Do the __**Wolf Whistle**__ quest
    • 4-16: Make Dreadfowls
    • 16-32: Make Granite Crabs
    • 32-46: Make Honeybadgers
    • 46-49: Make Pyrelords
    • 49-61: Make Bloated Leeches
    • 61-64: Make Smoke Devils or Bloated Leeches
    • 64-74: Make Stranger Plants or Smoke Devils
    • 74-87: Make Granite Lobsters

__**Herblore**__
Warbands is one of the best ways to cut the costs of herblore, and is relatively efficient as well. However, you want to stop at around 84 so you can stockpile on potions for PvM as you hit 99. That being said, you may still continue to do them daily anyway.
⬥ If possible, you can wait for a Double Experience Weekend before training herblore to halve the overall cost.
⬥ Always make use of portable wells when making potions for the +10% experience boost.
    • 1-84: Do Warbands daily
    • 84-88: Adrenaline Potions
    • 88-96: Make ~3350 of each extreme [Should that not be enough, just make some more adrenaline potions OR more extremes of equal amounts until you hit 96]
    • 96-99: Overloads
    • 98-99: Supreme overloads
        - You can boost to 107 Herblore via pulse core once you get to 99 in order to make Elder overload potions. These are the best-in-slot potions, and are very worth the cost.

.
__**Crafting**__
80 Crafting is required for Invention
Note: You can join a clan and make use of the weaving loom there for some free crafting experience.
⬥ Slow but free
    • 1-80: Dungeoneering Crafting
        - This method involves crafting either the magic or range armour in dungeoneering, selling that to smuggler, buying more supplies then repeating.

⬥ Slow but cheap
    • 1-80: Making the highest tier urn that you can.

⬥ Fast but expensive
    • 20-80: Cutting gems (sapphire, rubies, emeralds, diamonds).
    • 63-80: Making dragonhide armour.

__**Divination**__
80 Divination is needed for Invention
⬥ The best way to train divination early on is through daily activities.
    • 1-80: Guthixian Caches
        - You want to start doing Caches ASAP [At low level do them on legacy worlds, as there will be fewer people so you can Cres more often]
    • 70-80: Hall of Memories
        - Join the FC corehunting for the most efficient method of training here. They also have a Discord server if you are interested.

.
__**Smithing**__
80 smithing is required for invention
⬥ Check the wiki's Smithing training page for a more detailed walkthrough if you'd like.
    • 1-30: Do __**The Knight's Sword**__ quest, then make steel platebodies
    • 30-40: Make mithril platebodies
    • 40-50: Make adamant platebodies
    • 50-60: Make rune platebodies
    • 60-70: Make orikalkum platebodies
    • 70-80: Make necrite platebodies

__**Invention**__
⬥ Invention unlocks the ability to use perks on gear which contributes a huge amount of extra damage output.
Note: You are able to use Invention potions to boost and discover blueprints for experience.
    • 1-4: Do invention tutorial
    • 4-27: Research lvl 5 max items, then augment t70-75 gear, black salamanders are relatively cheap, then kill waterfiends and then disassemble when it hits level 5
    • 27-60: Research lvl 10 max items, then disassemble items once they hit level 10
    • 60-99/120: Either augment relatively cheap halberd/staff weapons and go to wilderness abyss to level (or abyssal demons if you have the slayer level) and disassemble at level 10 OR Augment a relatively expensive (t80+) weapon and level it to 12 then siphon. Item experience is directly tied to combat experience, so high combat xp training methods such as ED3 are recommended, or afking at abyssal demons should you have trained slayer enough.

.
> __**Quests**__
.tag:quests
For a breakdown of quests you should focus on getting done, read them over in <#689234925064290323>. However, you should especially be focused on doing __**The Temple at Senntisten**__, as it unlocks curses. The __**Plague's End**__ quest is also a high priority due to giving access to higher tier overload potions.

Moreover, it is worth noting that quests themselves are more rewarding the sooner you do them.
