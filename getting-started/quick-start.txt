.
> __**Combat Training**__
.tag:combat
The purpose of this ☝ section is 😍 to 👉🐚 break 😥😥 down, as 😊 simply 😡 as 💎 possible, 🔝 some 💭 relatively efficient 🔛🔛 means of 🥜 getting the combat 🏹 stats required to 🗣➡ begin 📦💦 bossing.
Notes: 😚 
⬥ You 👧 do 💯😊 not 🙅🤜 have to ✌ strictly follow this should 👫💘 your budget not 🙅🙅 allow 👍☁ you 👈 to ➡💰 do so. 💯😯
⬥ Acquiring a charming imp as early as possible will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. You can find a server dedicated to this in <#536715031128309780> (EDTeams) or <#773365514348527626>.
⬥ Constitution and Defence are 👏🔢 not listed as 🕘💯 they 🏼⁉ can be passively trained alongside the other combat styles.
⬥ While not 🚫🤷 mentioned, you 👈🎯 should always upgrade to 💋 the highest 🤑🤑 tier 👑 weapon and 💨 then power armour that 😐💦 you can 💦 afford when 💕 training. 🚣🏻
⬥ For melee specifically, 🔵🔵 a 👌 halberd range weapon is 💦 strongly 💪 recommended.

.
You 😭😩 have 2 main options when ⏱⤴ it 🤷😏 comes 💦 to 💦 training combat 🔫🗡 skills: Elite 👏 Dungeon 😈 3 😧🎆 trash runs and 👨 Slayer.

__**Elite Dungeons**__
ED3 trash runs 💰💰 offer the 🏳 highest 🤠🤑 combat 🏹♂ experience 💰💰 rates in 👆👉 the 😾 game ⚽🎮 as well 🕳🤒 as relatively good gp/h. It 🤔🅱 is 🍏🔥 recommended to have some decently leveled gear (level 🔥 50+ 👏👌 in a 😵👨 trio should be 🐝 fine), since 💦 exp gained is based 🏿😣 on 🔛 damage dealt. Find 💭🔍 teams to 💦 do 👌 this 👈💧 with 😣 in 👏 the 🌈🏻 servers mentioned alongside the 💵🚽 charming imp above. 👆 The 💻 two most 😃 common 🐩 methods are:
⬥ Elite 🏻🏻 Dungeons 3: 😭😭 all ❣ mobs till 🍆😻 the 👏👌 first pack of zombies
⬥ Elite Dungeons 1: 🤜♀ first floor 🤣😒 minibosses (farming Dungeoneering tokens)
    • It is 💡 highly recommended to 💰 have at least one experienced 💨🤳 player 🎮 in 📥 your 👶 group 🅱 for the 😊 ED1 method, as 🍑 the 🔍😢 bosses can 🤖🙅 be ✅🐝 quite 😵🅰 dangerous. 😱👎 The ED3 method is 🍊💦 more beginner friendly.

.
__**Slayer**__
Your 😄🍔 second 🅾 option is Slayer. While this ⬆ offers less 〽➖ combat 🔫 exp and 👏 gp/hr than EDs in 📅👌 the 👏🎅 early 🥂 levels, 📊 it ♀🙅 comes 😩 with 🏢🎃 the 👩 benefit 😩😩 of 💦🍒 leveling up ☝☝ a very 👌 lucrative skill 🎨 in 🙌 the 💩 future. It ⬇💯 also 👨😛 provides a 👀💍 lot 🍑🍑 of charms for 🍆 Summoning. A good 🏿😊 way ⬅ to 💦 train 🏻🚝 low 🏼🔽 level Slayer 🍆 is 🙈 crushing the corrupted scarabs that spawn in 👇👏 and 💦🚄 around Menaphos.
For more inofrmation: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Corrupted_Scarab_(Menaphos)>
⬥ Your ✋ number 😯 one 😈 priority for ✋ Slayer is ♻💯 to ⏸ complete 🚫 the __**Smoking Kills**__. ☠💀 This quest 🗺🗺 will 🤤 double all 🌞 your ⛓ Slayer 💦💦 point 👉 rewards 💰💰 from 👉🌎 completing tasks.
⬥ After that you ♂👆 should 💘👌 focus 🅱🍆 on 🏻 obtaining a 👏 Full 🈵 Slayer Helmet. This helm gives a 😩🤔 large 🏯🏔 accuracy and 😤➕ damage ☠ boost against monsters you ☝ have a 🅰💰 task 🚜🐴 for. 🍆♿

The following are 👏 methods to train if 👏 you 👈👶 do 👌 not 🤚 wish 😢 to 💦👉 do 💬😴 either ❗🤔 Slayer or Elite 👏 Dungeons. They 😄 are split 🚻🚻 up 🔺 by style. 💀😫

.
__**Attack and 👏💦 Strength**__ 👊
⬥ Note: 📝 __**The Grand 🏛🏛 Tree**__ 🎄🎄 quest gives 😚😚 a 👌 18,750 👸 experience 💰 lamp that 👼 you 👧😂 can 🔫 use 👎 on either 😗 Ranged, Strength, 💪 Attack, 🤼 Defence, Constitution or Magic. ✨ It is 😇🐠 recommended to 🍆 complete 💯 this quest and 👏 use 👏👏 it 😠 on 🌞🏿 either Ranged or 😇 Magic. ✨

__**Prayer**__
⬥ Once 🔂 you 🏻👏 reach ♀ 70 Prayer 🏼 you ➕ can 🔫🔫 make 📣 use of 💦🐙 the best 😍 normal 🖖 DPS prayers, 🙏 allowing you to start ▶ bossing relatively decent. It 🥊 is recommended to 💦 do this 👌💀 so 👉 you 👏 can fund 95 Prayer. 🚨👼

.
__**Summoning**__
This ⬇ section 📦📦 assumes you have achieved 🏆🏆 99 in 🍌✔ most, if not all, 🤷💯 combat 🏹🤼 styles doing ED3 trash runs 💰 and 👏💰 therefore have 🈶😑 the charms needed 🤒 for 🎁 99. 💵
⬥ Making use of the 👈 Familiarisation minigame will 😳 greatly aid in ⤵ farming charms.
⬥ Charming potions increase 💳 the 🗣👏 number 😯☎ of charms dropped 🔽 per kill 🙃 by 😀 1 for 😶 every 👏👏 mob, are purchasable from 💋😂 the Grand Exchange, and therefore 🔥 are 🏼👶 essential 💯 when gathering charms via 💰 ED3, as 🚫 the 👉💰 blue 🙆 ones are 😥👧 going to 💰😪 be the better 👅 option for training Summoning.  
⬥ While this list 📜 works 💦👩 for 🎅 the 😍🚮 most 😶 part, 💔👏 you can 💦 always 🏻😡 use 🖐 a 💯 calculator ♂ or the Summoning training 🏻 page 🔝 on 🔛👇 the 👇👨 wiki for a more 💴 detailed walkthrough.
⬥ You could realistically stop at level 96, since it grants u access to the most popular PvM familiars: Ripper Demons <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> and Yaks <:Yak:513195712201228289>. Getting level 99 is recommended because it is required to craft the (very useful) Combatant's Cape.

.
__**Herblore**__
Warbands is 😂 one 💞 of 🔥 the 👏 best ways to 👏 cut the 😉 costs of 💦😣 Herblore, and 🤠👏 is relatively efficient 🔛 as well. 🤔 However, 💰🖐 you 🍆😰 want 💞🆗 to 🔃💦 stop 🛑 at 🎖😴 around 🕦 84 so 🆘🕥 you can 🔝🔫 stockpile on 🔛 potions for 😏 PvM as you ⁉😀 hit 99. 🤑💵 That 😤 being ♂👏 said, you 🤔 may ⛲ still continue 🔁🔁 to do them 👏 daily 🕢 anyway. 🔛
⬥ If 🎅👏 possible, 🔝 you 😩💦 can 🔫 wait 😭 for 👉😩 a Double Experience 💰💰 Weekend before 🕰 training 🏻 Herblore to 👏 halve the 😤 overall cost.

    • 96-99: Overloads
    • 98-99: Supreme 🔥 overloads
        - You 🖌🤔 can ♀ boost to 107 Herblore via pulse core once 🍆🔂 you get to 👀💦 99 🤑♂ in order 🤜 to 👉💦 make 💵 Elder overload potions. These 📄 are the best-in-slot 😄 potions, and 💰 are 📲👏 very worth 💵 the 👏😫 cost. 💳💲
