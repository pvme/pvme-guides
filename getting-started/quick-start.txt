__**Things to Aim For When Starting Out**__
This section lists the recommended skill levels to get before getting started with bossing. None of these are strictly necessary, although advised in order to traverse a smooth path throughout the PvM learning curve.
⬥ Level 90+ in the desired combat style
    • Getting atleast 90 in the desired combat style is heavily recommended to ensure decent hitchance, damage, and survivability at most bosses.
⬥ Level 70 Prayer
    • This unlocks prayers which boost DPS by 8%, which are deeply helpful and easy to unlock.
⬥ Level 89 Herblore
    • This unlocks adrenaline potions and the possibility of boosting your level by +7 using pulse cores in order to access overloads. These two are extremely useful in almost all PvM scenarios.
⬥ Level 77 Summoning
    • This unlocks the Talon Beast familiar. 
        - Although heavily recommended getting to 96 ASAP, having a somewhat decent DPS familiar and a BoB (War Tortoise at 67) will be extremely helpful.
⬥ Unlocking and getting level 68 in Invention
    • This opens the possibility of boosting your level by +7 using an Extreme Invention potion in order to access Ancient Invention.
        - However, it is recommended to get higher levels before attempting optimal gizmos.

.
> __**Money Making**__
.tag:money
The purpose of this section is to explain some methods with which you can make money to start buying gear as a low level player.
⬥ Assumes no main account.
⬥ If main account exists to transfer gp/purchase bonds, skip this section.

.
__**Vis Wax**__
Requires: 50 Runecrafting
⬥ Located in the Runecrafting Guild, you may activate this machine once per day and choose 3 runes to obtain up to 100 vis wax.
⬥ The first rune is identical for everyone; the second rune is chosen at random between 3 runes; the third rune is random (Runecrafting skill cape perk reveals this rune).
*Note: It is recommended to use cheap runes to obtain vis wax. Try to use any of the following: air, mind, earth, water, fire, body, chaos, death. Avoid combination runes at all costs.*

.
__**Skilling Methods**__
⬥ Smithing Steel Bars
    • Do the quest __**The Knights Sword**__ to get the required Smithing level.
⬥ Making headless arrows
⬥ Archaeology: Harvesting cache materials

.
__**Other**__
⬥ Completing easy clues
    • They require almost no stats, yet can reward you with Fortunate Component-giving items worth ~800k-1m each. It is recommended to get at least 50 Thieving and 40 Agility should you plan to pickpocket H.A.M members for clues, however they are not required.

⬥ Collecting Zamorak mjolnirs
    • This method can net upwards of 4m/hr and has very little requirements.
    • See this guide: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Money_making_guide/Finding_Zamorak_mjolnirs>.

.
> __**Combat Training**__
.tag:combat
The purpose of this section is to break down, as simply as possible, some relatively efficient means of getting the combat stats required to begin bossing.
Notes: 
⬥ You do not have to strictly follow this should your budget not allow you to do so.
⬥ Acquiring a charming imp as early as possible will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. You can find a server dedicated to this in <#536715031128309780> (EDTeams) or <#773365514348527626>.
⬥ Constitution and Defence are not listed as they can be passively trained alongside the other combat styles.
⬥ While not mentioned, you should always upgrade to the highest tier weapon and then power armour that you can afford when training.
⬥ For melee specifically, a halberd range weapon is strongly recommended.

.
You have 2 main options when it comes to training combat skills: Elite Dungeon 3 trash runs and Slayer.

__**Elite Dungeons**__
ED3 trash runs offer the highest combat experience rates in the game as well as relatively good gp/h. It is recommended to have some decently leveled gear (level 50+ in a trio should be fine), since exp gained is based on damage dealt. Find teams to do this with in the servers mentioned alongside the charming imp above. The two most common methods are:
⬥ Elite Dungeons 3: all mobs till the first pack of zombies
⬥ Elite Dungeons 1: first floor minibosses (farming Dungeoneering tokens)
    • It is highly recommended to have at least one experienced player in your group for the ED1 method, as the bosses can be quite dangerous. The ED3 method is more beginner friendly.

.
__**Slayer**__
Your second option is Slayer. While this offers less combat exp and gp/hr than EDs in the early levels, it comes with the benefit of leveling up a very lucrative skill in the future. It also provides a lot of charms for Summoning. A good way to train low level Slayer is crushing the corrupted scarabs that spawn in and around Menaphos.
For more information:
<https://runescape.wiki/w/Corrupted_Scarab_(Menaphos)>
⬥ Your number one priority for Slayer is to complete the __**Smoking Kills**__. This quest will double all your Slayer point rewards from completing tasks.
⬥ After that you should focus on obtaining a Full Slayer Helmet. This helm gives a large accuracy and damage boost against monsters you have a task for.

The following are methods to train if you do not wish to do either Slayer or Elite Dungeons. They are split up by style.

.
__**Attack and Strength**__
⬥ Note: __**The Grand Tree**__ quest gives a 18,750 experience lamp that you can use on either Ranged, Strength, Attack, Defence, Constitution or Magic. It is recommended to complete this quest and use it on either Ranged or Magic.
    • 1-30: Do __**Waterfall Quest**__
    • 30-36:Do __**The Fight Arena**__ quest (Attack only)
    • 30-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves
    • 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum
        - Do: __**Regicide**__ for access to the Dragon Halberd.
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss
    • Alternatively: 70-90: Kill Hellhounds with Guthan's armour
    • 90-99: Either Wilderness Abyss or Waterfiends

.
__**Ranged**__
⬥ It is important to make use of the highest tier Chinchompa you are able to wield when training Ranged in the abyss.
⬥ Unlock the Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> ability ASAP.
    • 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves
    • 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss with Chinchompas
    • 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms)

.
__**Magic**__
⬥ Unlock the Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> ability ASAP.
    • 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthorpe Caves
        - At 30 Magic you have the Magic level for Evil Dave's Big day out, it is recommended to do this quest should you have the stats as it gives 50,000 Magic experience.
    • 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum
    • 60-90: Wilderness Abyss
    • 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms)

.
> __**Skills Training**__
.tag:skills
__**Prayer**__
⬥ Once you reach 70 Prayer you can make use of the best normal DPS prayers, allowing you to start bossing relatively decent. It is recommended to do this so you can fund 95 Prayer.
    • 1-27: Do: __**Restless Ghost**__; __**Priest in Peril**__; __**One Piercing Note**__, and then __**God Statues**__ monthly d&d
    • 27-70: Dragon bones on a Gilded Altar (PoH) with 2 lit burners OR Wilderness' Chaos Altar
    • 70-95: Dinosaur bones using the method listed above

.
__**Summoning**__
This section assumes you have achieved 99 in most, if not all, combat styles doing ED3 trash runs and therefore have the charms needed for 99.
⬥ Making use of the Familiarisation minigame will greatly aid in farming charms.
⬥ Charming potions increase the number of charms dropped per kill by 1 for every mob, are purchasable from the Grand Exchange, and therefore are essential when gathering charms via ED3, as the blue ones are going to be the better option for training Summoning.  
⬥ While this list works for the most part, you can always use a calculator or the Summoning training page on the wiki for a more detailed walkthrough.
⬥ You could realistically stop at level 96, since it grants u access to the most popular PvM familiars: Ripper Demons <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> and Yaks <:Yak:513195712201228289>. Getting level 99 is recommended because it is required to craft the (very useful) Combatant's Cape.
    • 1-4 : Do the __**Wolf Whistle**__ quest
    • 4-16: Make Dreadfowls 
    • 16-32: Make Granite Crabs 
    • 32-46: Make Honeybadgers
    • 46-49: Make Pyrelords
    • 49-61: Make Bloated Leeches
    • 61-64: Make Smoke Devils or Bloated Leeches
    • 64-74: Make Stranger Plants or Smoke Devils
    • 74-79: Make Granite Lobsters
    • 79-89: Make Moss Titans
    • 89-99: Make Rune Minotaurs (best cost x benefit since Mining and Smithing rework)

.
__**Herblore**__
Warbands is one of the best ways to cut the costs of Herblore, and is relatively efficient as well. However, you want to stop at around 84 so you can stockpile on potions for PvM as you hit 99. That being said, you may still continue to do them daily anyway.
⬥ If possible, you can wait for a Double Experience Weekend before training Herblore to halve the overall cost.
⬥ Always make use of portable wells when making potions for the +10% experience boost.
    • 1-38: Do Warbands daily or the highest level potion available
    • 38-52: Prayer potions
    • 52-66: Super Energy potions
    • 66-84: Super Defence potions
    • 84-88: Adrenaline potions
    • 88-96: Make ~3350 of each extreme [Should that not be enough, just make some more adrenaline potions OR more extremes of equal amounts until you hit 96]
    • 96-99: Overloads
    • 98-99: Supreme overloads
        - You can boost to 107 Herblore via pulse core once you get to 99 in order to make Elder overload potions. These are the best-in-slot potions, and are very worth the cost.

.
__**Crafting**__
80 Crafting is required for Invention
*Note: You can join a clan and make use of the weaving loom in your clan citadel for some free Crafting experience.*
⬥ Slow but free:
    • 1-80: Dungeoneering Crafting
        - Craft either Magic or Ranged armour in Daemonheim, sell that to smuggler, buy more supplies then repeat.

⬥ Slow but cheap:
    • 1-80: Make the highest tier urn that you can

⬥ Fast but expensive:
    • 20-80: Cut gems (sapphire, rubies, emeralds, diamonds)
    • 63-80: Make dragonhide armour

__**Divination**__
80 Divination is needed for Invention
⬥ The best way to train Divination early on is through daily activities.
    • 1-80: Guthixian Caches
        - You want to start doing Caches ASAP [At low level do them on legacy worlds, as there will be fewer people so you can Cres more often].
    • 70-80: Hall of Memories
        - Join the corehunting FC for the most efficient method of training here. They also have a Discord server if you are interested.

.
__**Smithing**__
80 Smithing is required for Invention
⬥ Check the wiki's Smithing training page for a more detailed walkthrough if you'd like.

    • 40-50: Make adamant platebodies +2
    • 50-60: Make rune platebodies +3
    • 60-70: Make orikalkum platebodies +3
    • 70-80: Make necrite platebodies +4

.
__**Invention**__
⬥ Invention unlocks the ability to use perks on gear which contributes a huge amount of extra damage output.
*Note: You are able to use Invention potions to boost and discover blueprints for experience.*
    • 1-4: Do Invention tutorial
    • 4-27: Research lvl 5 max items, then augment tier 70-75 gear(black salamanders are relatively cheap), do ED3 trash runs and disassemble the items when they hit level 5
    • 27-60: Research lvl 10 max items, then disassemble items once they hit level 10
    • 60-99/120: Either augment relatively cheap halberd/staff weapons and go to ED3 trash runs/wilderness abyss to level and disassemble at level 10 OR Augment a relatively expensive (t80+) weapon and level it to 12 then siphon. Item experience is directly tied to combat experience, so high combat xp training methods such as ED3 are recommended, afking at abyssal demons is also valid if you have trained Slayer enough

.tag:quests
__**General Quests for PvMing**__
.
⬥ For a breakdown of quests you should focus on getting done, read them over in <#689234925064290323>. 
⬥ Two quests worth mentioning are __**The Temple at Senntisten**__ and __**Plague's End**__. The first unlocks curses, which are basically stronger prayers. The second unlocks better overloads and combination potions.
*Note: Quests are more rewarding the sooner you do them.*
