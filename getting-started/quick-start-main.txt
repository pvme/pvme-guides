## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
**This channel is intended as a guide for newer and returning players looking to jumpstart their way into RS3 PvM and Bossing.** This page links to a host of pages, each dedicated to cover important subjects that help you on your PvM journey.
⬥ **General tips** like setting up your game interface and basic money making to get started.
⬥ **New to PvM** to get you to level 70 in every combat style! There are:
    • Example upgrade orders and ability bars
    • Guides on the important non-combat skills for PvM and some training methods
    • Important quests to work towards
⬥ **New to Bossing** assumes you already have most of the PvM knowledge and skill from **New to PvM**, and helps you set progression goals for bossing. This includes prayer flicking, good bosses for learning, how to learn PvM, and how to transition to full manual combat.
⬥ Note that the discord links in here will refer to either of two Runescape Discord servers. If you have not joined these, the links **won't** work.
    • The official Runescape Discord [invite link](<https://discord.com/invite/rs>)
    • The PvM Encyclopedia [invite link](<https://discord.gg/invite/pvme>)
