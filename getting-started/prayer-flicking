> **__What is Prayer Flicking?__**
.tag:intro
Prayer flicking is often thought of as two separate things:
⬥ ‘Prayer flicking’, which is changing your protection prayer to that of the boss’s current attacks (and changing the protection prayer as they change styles).
⬥ ‘Soulsplit flicking’, which involves using the Soulsplit prayer <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> most of the time, and then switching back to the protection prayer for the boss’s current attack style before the boss’s attack hits.

This guide will cover the benefits of both prayer and Soulsplit flicking, and explain how to do them!

.tag:Why
⬥ Having a protection prayer up, reduces your incoming damage from this style by 50%, which is increased to 60% if wearing an amulet of souls or an essence of finality amulet.
⬥ Keeping the correct protection prayer up even when the boss is changing attack styles reduces the damage taken substantially, this reduces food usage.
⬥ When the correct prayer is active, devotion can be used to block the typed damage.
*Note: Prayer flicking can be done on either prayer book, requiring level 43 prayer to protect from all 3 styles on the basic prayer book <:protectfrommelee:1052551452788269127> <:protectfrommagic:1052551456835768351> <:protectfrommissiles:1052551455078367313> , and 71 on curses <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> <:deflectrange:544195488317046812> .*

> **__Why is Soulsplit Flicking Useful?__**
⬥ Having Soulsplit active for most of the time you are attacking, results in a lot of healing, which can reduce the food needed for bosses substantially, allowing you to use no food for most bosses in the game.
⬥ Soulsplit synergises well with the ECB special attack and the blood reaver familiar, so Soulsplit flicking allows for the use of these, while keeping protection prayers up.
*Note: Soulsplit flicking can be done on only the curses prayer book, requiring level 92 prayer to have access to all 3 protection prayers and soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> <:deflectrange:544195488317046812> .*

> **__Why is Reducing Food Usage Good?__**
⬥ Not needing to use as much food, can increase room for error which makes kills more comfortable, increases kills per trip at bosses you do not want to teleport out of, can reduce the supply cost for bossing, and if using solid food (such as sailfish <:sailfish:565726489363087360> ) or Saradomin brews <:brew:565726489400573962> , reduces the adrenaline drained, or stat reduction from these healing items allowing for faster kills also.
⬥ If reducing your food usage below a full inventory, it can allow you to switch from a beast of burden <:yak:513195712201228289> <:mammoth:513195712146702337> to a DPS familiar <:smokenihil:854475442227642388> <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, which again reduces kill times.

> **__How to Prayer / Soulsplit Flick?__**
.tag:How
The most important step towards prayer or Soulsplit flicking, is setting up good keybinds (see <#1020546905865986068> ), and using them lots to build up muscle memory. Most people have these close together on the keyboard, near their abilities so that they can be used throughout the fight.

The method of prayer or Soulsplit flicking is simple:
⬥ Look at the boss’s attack animations for the style.
⬥ Look at the boss’s attack rotation for attack styles (for example Vindicta in second phase).
⬥ When an attack animation of a style you are not currently protecting against happens, switch to that protection prayer.

⬥ If Soulsplit flicking, after taking the reduced damage, switch back to Soulsplit as soon as possible.

*Note: if Soulsplit flicking, you want to switch from Soulsplit to the protection prayer as **late** as possible to have Soulsplit active for as long as possible, so it is good to get used to the timing of the hits to make the most out of your Soulsplit time.*

.tag:Practice
⬥ Arch Glacor normal mode with the flurry attack toggled on.
⬥ Vindicta (2nd phase has an attack rotation of charge, melee, ranged, melee).
⬥ Araxxor (This is slightly harder if using melee and not standing at halberd range, as the melee attacks have less time to react).
⬥ Raksha.
⬥ Jad (fight caves, kiln, or zuk).
⬥ Any other boss you want to do!

> **__Tips to Help Learning to Prayer / Soulsplit Flick__**
.tag:Tips
⬥ Do **not** be discouraged if you feel you are missing a lot of flicks, it is not uncommon, but these skills are very rewarding, and near **essential** for pvming.
⬥ If you find yourself a little bit overwhelmed with the new keybinds, its not a bad idea to set up revo or revo++ to reduce your inputs as you start learning, and then later going back to either revo or full manual when you are more comfortable.
⬥ If you have learnt how to prayer flick, don’t be scared to give Soulsplit flicking a go, even if just at bosses which attack a little bit slower.
