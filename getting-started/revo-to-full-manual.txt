⬥ The revolution combat mode allows the game to automatically activate abilities on your ability bar in a sequential order. There are three modes to revolution: only basics (revo), basics and thresholds (revo+), or basics and thresholds and ultimates (revo++).
      • For a player just getting into pvm or bossing it is perfectly fine to use revolution. 
      • There are helpful guides and ability bar set ups on the official RS Wiki that make revolution viable in combat. 
      • For most combat situations and scenarios, revolution is good enough.
⬥ Full manual is a combat mode where the game does not activate any abilities for you. Every ability you want to use in combat will require an input from the player. 
      • With no inputs from the player, full manual combat mode will only use auto attacks.
      • Full manual offers more control over what abilities are used, when they are used, and how they are used.

⬥ **__Channeled abilities__**
      • Usually last longer than a Global Cooldown (3 ticks or 1.8s).
      • Have an extra delay between the last hit of the ability and the start of the next ability.
          - This delay can be negated by manually inputting the next ability.
          - Revolution will let the delay run it's course which wastes time and damage.

⬥ Below is a comparison of manually canceling a channeled ability vs just letting revo do it for you. Top version will let revo cancel Snipe for them, with no manual input at all. The bottom version will manually cancel the Snipe ability to initiate the next ability quicker. Notice how long the top player just stands idle after the Snipe.
      • **Note:** manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing.

⬥ **__Ultimate abilities__**
      • Should normally be used manually even if using revo (except afk slayer).
      • Good revo bars will have the stronger abilities towards the beginning of the revo bar so they get activated more frequently.
          - This is good for general use but detrimental for damage boosting ultimates like Sunshine/Death's Swiftness/Berserk.
              • The best abilities will likely be on cooldown at the start of your damage boosting ult due to being at the front of the revo bar.
              • Some of the best abilities are bleeds which will be near the front of the revo bar, but bleeds are NOT boosted by damage boosting ultimates.
      • Full manual benefits a lot in damage boosting ultimates because you have full control of when you use the strong abilities.
          - Strong abilities can be saved until you are within the damage boosting ultimate to get more use out of them.
          - Bleed usage can be easily avoided in damage boosting ultimates since you can just choose to not input any bleed abilities.

⬥ The below gif will demonstrate how revo can make someone use bad abilities in a damage boosting ultimate (take a look at what abilities were used right after sunshine).

      • Using full manual, this person would have been able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine. They can choose to use bleeds such as Corruption Blast or Combust, or they can choose to use a weaker ability such as Tuska’s Wrath right before Sunshine to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath and Impact (Flanking) are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine.

⬥ **__Boss Mechanics__**
⬥ As you progress in pvm and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses with mechanics where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where revolution could cause more harm than good:
      • Arraxor: Web Shield mechanic 
          - Player must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage gets reflected onto the player potentially causing a KO
      • Vorago: Reflect mechanic
          - Damage gets reflected onto a player and revo requires a manual input to stop attacking
      • Telos: Hold Still Invader
          - This mechanic is commonly dealt with by switching to a shield and using Resonance. This does require precise timings and if you are on revo, there is a chance that revo activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance. This activates the Global Cooldown and you are unable to use Resonance in time.
      • Kalphite King: Beetlejuice (Green)
          - This mechanic requires provoking KK then either using Devotion or Resonance to negate/heal from the large hit. If using Resonance it requires precise timing.
      • Nex: Blood Siphon and Blood Phase
          - Any attacks during Blood Siphon will heal Nex rather than hurt her. This requires manual input to stop attacking during the special attack.
          - Blood phase has a mechanic where bleeds (Fragmentation Shot, Corruption Shot, etc.) will heal her instead of hurt her. Requires manual input to avoid using bleeds.
      • Helwyr: Swipe Attack
          - Strong melee attack. A common strategy to deal with the mechanic is to Resonance it to heal some health back. Requires precise timing and manual input.
.

⬥ __**Revo with mostly manual inputs**__
      • There is not much difference between using full manual without revo vs. full manual with revo as a backup.
          - The biggest difference between the two is without revo you have insurance that you will never use an ability that you didnt mean to use.
          - Auto attacks do not work well with revo. For example with magic if you wish to utilize 4TAA, you need to input the auto attack once to cancel your next revo input. and again to actually fire the auto attack.

⬥ **__5 tick auto attack (5TAA)__**
      • Melee and Range cannot utilize 5TAA because there is no "auto" button like mage has with casting a spell to stop the next ability from happening.
      • 5TAA can normally be used instead of a weaker ability if the better abilities happen to be on cooldown at the same time.

> **__How to Transition from Revo to Full Manual__**
.tag:transition
⬥ Set good keybinds.
      • It is very important to have keybinds that are comfortable to reach and make sense to you.
      • It is up to the user to decide what keybinds make sense to them, but there is a video guide full of helpful suggestions here made by <@158292421724209152>: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn_y-_2giZg>
      
⬥ Practice the keybinds.
      • Spend time at combat dummies just getting used to the keybinds, and commit them to muscle memory. Your goal is to not need to think about what keybind does what ability. You should know what ability you want to do, and the muscle memory should do the rest for you.
      • Another good place to practice is God Wars Dungeon 2 due to how it has low death potential and can earn you some money as you practice the new keybinds. 
      
⬥ Choose a gradual transition or fully commit to full manual right away.
      • Some players find it easier to start easing into full manual by keeping revo active as a backup, but using more and more manual inputs until they feel confident enough to turn revo off.
      • Some players find it easer to rip the bandaid off and just turn off revo, then practice their keybinds over and over until they are confident enough to use full manual in real PvM scenarios.
          - Again, it is up to the user to decide what works best for them.
