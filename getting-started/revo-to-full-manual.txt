.tag:intro
⬥ The 🏻🚟 Revolution 👺👺 combat 🔫🔫 mode allows the 🗣 game to ♂🤔 automatically activate abilities on your 👨 ability 👉👉 bar 🥃🥃 in a ➡ sequential order. There are 🔢🏿 three modes to revolution: only 👬 basics (revo), basics and 👏 thresholds (revo+), or 💁 basics, thresholds and 🍀 ultimates (revo++).
    • For 😏 a player just getting into PvM, it 😽😂 is perfectly fine ♀ to 💦🔜 use 👏 revolution. 
    • There 🏿 are 👄♀ helpful guides and 🥜 ability 👉 bar 🥃🍻 set 😠 ups on the 🤝 official RS Wiki that 👨 make 💰 Revolution viable in 💘🛌 combat. 🏹 
    • For 🎅🍆 most combat 🏹🏹 situations and 👏🔙 scenarios, Revolution 👺👺 is OK enough.

⬥ Full 👏 manual is 👉 a 🚨😜 combat 🕰 mode where the 🗣 game does 😻 not 🚫😫 activate any abilities for 🎅⌛ you. 👈✈ Every ⏱👏 ability 👉👉 you 😟👦 want 👏 to 😋 use ✊ in combat 🤼 will require an 😚 input 🚾🚾 from the 🏆 player. 
    • With 💦 no inputs from the 😍🚟 player, full 🈵 manual will only use 👏👏 auto 🤖🤖 attacks.
    • Full 🚫💯 manual offers more 📈 control ✋ over 😌👏 what abilities are used, 😏 when they are ♀🔢 used, 🏭🚟 and 🚫❤ how they are 💩 used. 📅

**__A Comparison Between Revolution and Full Manual__**

⬥ **__Channeled abilities__**
    • Usually last longer 😏😒 than 💉 a 👦😯 Global Cooldown (3 ticks or 💁💁 1.8s).
    • Have 💢 an 🦅🏼 extra 🗣 delay between 🏻 the 😉🎅 last 🤤😡 hit 👊😤 of 😤 the ability and the 👏 start 🔘 of 😍 the 👏 next ability.
        - This delay can 😤🔫 be negated by 😈🍄 manually inputting the 🅱🌊 next ability. 👉👉
        - Revolution 👺 will let 🙆🙆 the delay run its 💰😙 course, 👍🏎 which ❓ wastes time and 💰 damage. ☠☄

⬥ Below ⬇ is 👏😩 a comparison of manually canceling a 🍬👏 channeled ability 👉👉 vs just 🐩💢 letting ❌ revo do it 😂😵 for 👧 you. 🅱👶 The 🍑 player 🤷 in 👏 the 👏😜 top 🔼 version will let revo cancel ❌❌ Snipe for them, 😏👈 with 👏 no 😤 manual input at all. 🙀 The ⛪ player 🤷💰 in 👏 the 🏽 bottom 👇 version will 👏🎧 manually cancel ❌ the ⏩ Snipe ability 👉 to 💸 initiate the 👏 next ⏩ ability quicker. 💨 Notice 👎👎 how 😕 long ⌛ the ☝👏 top player 🤷♀ just 👏👌 stands 🚶🚶 idle after ❌ Snipe.

*Note: Manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on Revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing.*

.
⬥ **__Ultimate abilities__**
    • Should 💘 normally be 🐝😎 used 🚟 manually even 🆗 if 👏😂 using Revolution 👺💥 (except 😮 afk slayer). 💦
    • Good ♀👌 Revolution bars will have ♂ the stronger 💪 abilities towards ⛪ the 👏 beginning ➡😍 of 👯🥜 the revo bar 😫🥃 so 💯 they get 🍌 activated more frequently. ☣
        - This is good for general usage but detrimental for damage boosting ultimates like Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> and Berzerk <:zerk:535532854004678657>.
    • The 🐘 best abilities will ⚽ likely be 🤘 on 😢 cooldown at 🤴 the 😈 start ⏸ of 👏✝ your damage ☄☄ boosting ult due to 🎖 being at 👉 the front 🔝🔝 of 🎖💦 the 👏💰 revo bar. 🍻🥃
    • Some of 🤑👏 the best abilities are bleeds which 🏼 will 😠 be 🙋 near 😯 the front 🔝🔝 of the 💚 revo bar, 🥃🥃 but 🚼🍑 bleeds are NOT 🎼♂ boosted by 🏻 damage boosting ultimates.
    • Full manual benefits a 👻🅱 lot in damage boosting ultimates because 🕵 you 👧 have 😩 full 💯💯 control 🏻😵 of when 😱😂 you 👉 use the 👉🏻 strong 💪💪 abilities.
        - Strong 🏼 abilities can 🔫🔫 be saved ✝ until 🅱😍 you are 💁❓ within the 🌜🌊 damage boosting ultimate to 😛👏 get more out of 🅱 them.
        - Bleed 😳😳 usage can 🔫 be easily 😊 avoided in damage boosting ultimates since 👨 you 😀 can just ♀ choose 📥 to not input 🚾📫 any 👏🍵 bleed 😳💉 abilities.

⬥ The 👏 gif below ⬇ will ♀ demonstrate 💯 how 💯 Revolution 👺 can make 📝💰 someone use 🖐 bad abilities in 👏 a damage boosting ultimate. Take 👧🛍 a look 👀 at 👅👒 what 😱❓ abilities were 😫👏 used right 🔫 after 🅱👀 sunshine: ☀👺

    • Using Full Manual, this person would have been able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. 
        - They can choose to use bleeds such as Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> or Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, or they can choose to use a weaker ability such as Tuska’s Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> right before Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> (Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185>) are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

**__Boss Mechanics__**
⬥ As 🖕 you 👶 progress in PvM and face 😀 tougher and 💦 tougher bosses, you 😰🍆 will encounter bosses with ❌ mechanics 💰 where 🌵 revolution could greatly hinder your 💦 combat 🏹 ability. 👉 Here are ♀ a few 😋🔛 scenarios where revolution 👺👺 could 🚅 cause 💋 more 🅱 harm than 👄☄ good: 👀👌

    • **Araxxor:**
        - During his web shield, 💦⚗ the 😱👏 player 🏋 must 🙅🔐 manually input 🚾 to stop ✋😳 attacking, ♂ otherwise all 👭💦 damage ☠☠ dealt gets 👀 reflected 💡💡 onto the 👏 player, 💰🎮 potentially causing a 💰👌 KO

    • **Vorago:** 
        - During 🏃🚣 his reflect, damage gets 😵😵 reflected 💡 onto a 🦂 player and 💨 Revo requires a 💰🅱 manual input for 🎅🌽 the 👱 player 👨🏋 to 💰 stop 🚫 attacking 🤼

    • **Telos:**
        - For "Hold Still, Invader", you switch to a shield and use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>. This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, activating GCD which will ruin your timing.
.
    • **Kalphite King:** 👑 
        - During his green attack, you're required to provoke KK, then use either Devotion or Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> to negate damage/heal from the large hit.

    • **Nex:**
        - Any 🤔🅱 attacks during Blood 💉 Siphon will 💦 heal Nex rather ☑🙇 than hurt her, requiring manual input to 💦⚫ prevent 🚫🚫 Revolution 💥💥 from attacking 🤼♂ her.
        - During Blood 🎈👀 Phase, Nex heals from 👈 bleeds, requiring manual input 📫📫 to avoid 🙅🙅 using 📤📤 bleeds.

    • **Helwyr:** 
        - For his swipe attack, a common strategy to deal with it is to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> it to heal some health back. This does require precise timing and if you are not on FM, there is a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, activating GCD which will ruin your timing.

⬥ __**Revo with 😣 mostly manual inputs**__
    • There ✔ is 😩🔮 not much 🏾💵 difference ❗ between 👏 using Full Manual without 🚱❌ Revolution, 💥👺 versus Full 😶💯 Manual with Revolution 👺💥 as 🅱🏿 a 🌇 backup.
        - The 💊🏠 biggest 🙄🍆 difference ❗ between 🏻 the two is 😮❌ without 😀 revo, you have insurance 🌈🌈 that 👌♂ you will 👏💰 never 😅 use 🖐🎮 an ability that 👳😔 you didn't 😊 mean to 👏 use.
        - Auto 🤖🤖 attacks do 👏 not ❌ work 🙄 well 🕳😨 with 🙅 Revolution. For example 🔥 with 👏 Magic 📿📿 if you 🐶👉 wish 😢 to ✌💦 utilize 4TAA, you need to 📬💦 input the auto attack ⚔ once 👆 to 😳 cancel ❌❌ your 👉⚖ next ☃➡ revo input. ➡ and 🚟🔙 again ❗ to 👂 actually 👀🚟 fire the auto 🤖🤖 attack. 🤼⚔

⬥ **__5 tick auto attack ⚔ (5TAA)__**
    • Melee and 🌞 Ranged cannot utilize 5TAA because 🤔 there 👌 is 😦🤔 no "auto" 🤖🤖 button 🔥🔥 like 📞 Magic 📿 has 👏 with casting a spell to stop the next ⏩ ability from 👉 happening. 👀👀
    • 5TAA can normally be 🤔🐝 used 🚟 instead of a 🐶 weaker 👎👎 ability if the better abilities happen 💁💁 to ✌ be on 🔛🔛 cooldown at 🙈🍆 the 🅱 same time. ⌚⏰

.tag:transition
**__Step by step__**

⬥ **Set 😠 good 😀 keybinds.**
    • It 🍆 is 🅱 very important ❌ to have 😒 keybinds that 😝😍 are comfortable to 👌😀 reach 🤝♀ and ➕ make sense to 💦😢 you. 🏿
    • It 😤 is 🔥👏 up to ➡ the user 💪 to 👉 decide 😱 what 😦😅 keybinds make 📣☝ sense to them. 
      
⬥ **Practice 🍆 the 😢 keybinds.**
    • Spend 💸 time at 🍆😎 combat 🗡🏹 dummies just 👌😡 getting used 🙄 to 🎉 the 👏 keybinds, and commit 🗡 them to muscle 👅 memory. 👏 Your 💦✨ goal is 🙈💯 to 💦 not 🚫🚫 need 👍👌 to think 🤔🤔 about 💦 what 😦 keybind does 😈☝ what ⁉😑 ability. 👉👉 You should 😑💘 know 👅🙇 what 🤔😦 ability 👉 you want 👅👏 to do, 💕😽 and 💰😍 the 🚗 muscle 👅 memory 🏼 should 👶 do the 👑 rest for 💕 you. 😘
    • Another good place 🏢🤤 to 🏼😛 practice is 😂 God ✡ Wars Dungeon 2 😩🙊 due to 👆😏 how 💯🗣 it 😠 has 💰💰 low death 🎲 potential and 👏 can earn 💵💰 you 💯 some money 💦💦 as you practice the 🐬 new 🎧 keybinds. 
      
⬥ **Gradual transition, or 🙅🚪 fully 😕 commit.** 🗡🗡
    • Some 🐓🅱 players 🎮💰 find it easier 😀😁 to 👁 start 👣 easing into 👉 full 👏 manual by 😈👏 keeping revo active as 👦🏿 a 💯 backup, but 🌚 using 📤 more and more ➕😇 manual inputs until 💯💦 they ♀😂 feel 👎 confident enough to ♂🎦 turn 🤔❗ revo off. 💦⚾
    • Some 💚 players 💰 find 🔍 it easer to ♂ rip 😂 the 📲 band aid off 😝😝 and just 👏 turn 🏼 off 😝 revo, then 🔙😥 practice 🍆 their keybinds over 🔜 and ♀ over until 🕛🕓 they 👥👥 are 💰 confident enough 💦💦 to 😂 use ❌👏 full manual in 👏 real PvM scenarios.
        - Again, it 🍆 is 😳👐 up to 💦 the 👏 user to 💦 decide 😱😱 what works 👷🤔 best for 🐻👉 them. 👩🏼
