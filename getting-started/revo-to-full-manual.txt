Runescape has 3 different combat modes: **revolution (revo)**, **revolution++ (revo++)** and **full manual (FM)**.
This guide aims to cover what these different game modes are, what a player just starting out might want to use, and how to transition to using full manual.

Combat modes can be configured by going to **Esc > Gameplay Settings > Combat & Action Bar > Combat Mode**.

> __**Revolution (Revo)**__
.tag:revo
*Note: For a list of of revo/revo++bars, see `!revo`, `!revo++` and `!aoe`.*
⬥ **Revolution lets the game automatically activate abilities on your ability bar in sequential order** (based on adrenaline and cooldowns).
⬥ Revo can be configured to activate any combination of:
    • Basics
    • Thresholds
    • Ultimates
⬥ If configured to also use thresholds and ultimates for you, it is referred to as **revo++**.
⬥ **Remember, you can still provide user input to override revo/revo++ when you want**.
    • This may be easier with ability queueing on.

.
__**Is Revolution Good?**__
⬥ It gives up some control over using your basics but also means less user input is required.
⬥ Some reasons revo can helpful include:
    • You're just getting into PvM
    • Combat seems to have too much to focus on
    • You want the game to use basics but still have control over stronger abilities.
⬥ **For most combat situations, you *can* get away with using Revo** <:thumbsup:1038921586574622791>
⬥ There are helpful guides and ability bar setups that can make it work.

.
__**Is Revolution++ Good?**__
⬥ Revo++ makes the game far more AFK, by reducing user input significantly.
⬥ This comes at the cost of flexibility and adapability to different combat situations.
⬥ Places where Revo++ is useful:
    • AFK tasks like Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857>
    • Special Revo++ bars *specifically designed for a particular boss*
⬥ **Ideally avoid Revo++ *outside the above scenarios* → prefer normal Revo everywhere else.**

.
__**Full Manual**__
.tag:fm
__**What Is Full Manual**__
⬥ **In full manual, you must use every ability you want yourself - the game activates nothing for you.**
⬥ If no inputs are given, full manual will only use auto attacks.
⬥ It has a higher skill floor, but also rewards the player for the effort they put into it.

.
__**Is Full Manual Required?**__
⬥ Full manual is not required to play or enjoy the game, but progressively harder content will benefit from using it.
⬥ **It is recommended to learn full manual *at some point*.**
⬥ Full manual offers more control over what you use:
    • You can slow down or burst your DPS at important times in a boss fight
    • You can save abilities for specific scenarios (e.g. stuns for when you need them, or AoE abilities

.
> __**Revo vs. Full Manual - Why You Should Switch!**__
.tag:compare
In this section, we cover some reasons why full manual is preferable. Afterwards, in __**How to Switch to Full Manual**__, we discuss how you can progress there.
.
__**Channeled Abilities**__
⬥ Channeled abilities usually last longer than 1 global cooldown (1.8s, or 3 ticks).
⬥ **Revo/Revo++ introduce a small delay last hit of the channel, and the start of the next ability.**
⬥ This applies to the following abilities:
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770>
⬥ The delay can be prevented by manually inputting the next ability.
    • Revolution will let the delay run its course, which wastes time and damage.

⬥ See the following comparison of manually cancelling <:gconc:869285393223254107> (left side) vs. just letting Revo do it for you (right side) - notice how with Revo enabled, thre is a 1-tick delay before the next ability is used.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/9C2JEZQ.mp4
*Note: Manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on Revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing.*

.
__**Ultimate Abilities**__
⬥ **You should use ultimates manually even if using Revo** (except for stuff like full AFK slayer, etc.)
⬥ Good Revo bars will have  stronger abilities near the front of the bar so they get used more frequently.
⬥ This is good for general usage but detrimental for damage-boosting ultimates.
    • e.g. Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> / Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> / Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>
    • Stronger abilities will likely be on cooldown at the when you use your ultimate, due to being at the front of the revo bar.
    • Some of the best abilities are bleeds which will be near the front of the revo bar, but bleeds are NOT boosted by damage boosting ultimates.
⬥ Whereas if you use full manual, you have full control:
    • Strong abilities can be saved until you are within the ultimate to get more out of them.
    • Use of bleeds can be reduced/avoided in damage boosting ultimates since you can just choose to not press them.
    • You can even choose the right time to use your ultimate (e.g. don't use it before the boss becomes immune, etc.)

⬥ The clip below will demonstrate how Revo can make someone use bad abilities in a damage-boosting ultimate. See what abilities were used right after Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070>:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Y6XWNaF.mp4
⬥ If using full manual instead, they could have better planned out what abilities to use before using <:sunshine:994921119381463070>
    • They could have made sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Impact <:impactflank:867678154369400862> are off cooldown and ready immediately after <:sunshine:994921119381463070>, by using other abilities to build adrenaline like Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> or Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>.

.
__**Boss Mechanics**__
As you progress in PvM and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses with mechanics where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where Revo could cause more harm than good:

⬥ **Araxxor** <:Araxxi:513213019543699466>
    • During his web shield, players must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage dealt gets reflected onto the player, potentially killing them.
⬥ **Vorago** <:vorago:572867742613635082>
    • During his reflect mechanic, similar to Araxxor, players must manually stop attacking to prevent killing themselves or another person via reflect damage.
⬥ **Telos** <:Telos:513212949033123840>
    • For his "Hold Still, Invader" attack, you switch to a shield <:merciless:583430258829688854> and use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>
    • This requires somewhat precise timing and there's a chance Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, triggering the global cooldown which can mess up the timing.
.
⬥ **Kalphite King** <:KalphiteKing:513212971409866765>
    • During his 'Green' attack, a player needs to provoke <:voke:535541259465392143> the boss and use either Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> or Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> to avoid dying
    • If Revolution uses something else and delays the defensives, it might kill them.
⬥ **Nex** <:Nex:513213159071547395>
    • Any attacks during her 'Blood Siphon' will heal Nex rather than hurt her, requiring manual input to prevent Revolution from attacking her.
    • During Blood Phase, Nex heals from bleeds, requiring manual input to avoid using bleeds.
⬥ **Helwyr** <:Helwyr:513213019635843100>
    • A common way to deal with his 'You Will Bleed!' swipe attack is to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> it to heal some HP.
    • This needs somewhat precise timing and there's a chance that Revolution activates an ability while you are waiting to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, triggering the global cooldown which can mess up the timing.
⬥ **Arch-Glacor** <:archglacor:891948878583189514>
    • During his 'Arms' mechanic, players must quickly deal damage on one of his arms to break free.
    • Revolution might waste a strong ability on the boss (who is immune at this point) before you switch to target his arms, lowering your DPS output.

.
__**Revo with (Mostly) Manual Inputs**__
⬥ There is not much difference between using Full Manual *without* Revolution, vs. Full Manual *with* Revolution *as a backup*.
    • The main difference is it ensures you don't suddenly use an ability that you didn't intend to.
    • **Auto attacks do not work well with Revolution** - e.g. 4TAA with Magic with Revo on will require *twice* the inputs (once to cancel revo, and a second input to cast an auto) compared to without Revo.

.
> __**How to Switch from Revolution to Full Manual**__
.tag:transition
**Learning full manual can take time - this is normal.** However, just like with any other game, its not unreasonable to expect players to pick up the required skill over time.
.
__**Step by Step**__
⬥ **Set good keybinds.**
    • It is very important that your **keybinds are comfortable to reach** and **make sense to you**.
    • It is up to you to decide what works best for you.
    • See the **Action Bars** and **Keybinds** sections in <#1020546905865986068> for some ideas.

⬥ **Practice the keybinds.**
    • You need to be able to use your keybinds effectively - **this means commiting them to muscle memory.**
    • Your goal is to not need to think about what keybind does what ability - you should know what ability you want to do, and the muscle memory should do the rest for you.
    • **It is normal for this to take some time**, but trust the process!

⬥ **Choose - gradual transition, or full sending it.**
    • Some players find it easier to start to keep Revo on for backup, but focus on using more manual inputs until they can turn off Revo entirely.
    • Others may just jump in and turn off Revo, and practice until they can effectively use their binds, and not lose time trying to use abilities.
    • **It is up to you to decide what works best for you.**

⬥ **Focused practice**
    • When practicing keybinds, *make sure the focus is practicing keybinds*.
    • This means you shouldn't try to learn too many other things at the same time, such as prayer flicking or new boss mechanics, etc.
    • Get used to full manual doing PvM you're already familiar with.

⬥ **Good places to practice keybinds:**
    • **Combat Dummies** <:dummy:656844963522281473> - to initially learn your keybinds.
    • **Full manual slayer** - makes you think about prioritising abilities and using AoEs properly.
    • **GWD2** - relatively easy bosses with few mechanics and high health to practice rotations on (plus decent <:coins:698816156961603654> profit!)
    • **Arch-Glacor** <:archglacor:891948878583189514> - toggleable mechanics for a customized fight to practice movement, defensives, and DPS checks.
    • Check out <#1020546518941454438> for more ideas.
