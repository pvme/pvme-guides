## __Bossing__
.tag:bossing
⬥ If you are particularly interested in bossing, [reaper tasks](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Reaper>) are a daily activity where Death asks you to kill a certain boss. This is a good way to experience different bosses.
⬥ You can also check out <#1020546518941454438> to set some bossing goals.
⬥ Basic guides for most bosses in Runescape can be found in <#1156667543533125695>. These guides have beginner preset recommendations, an overview of the boss's mechanics, and suggestions for how to deal with them.

## __Improving Damage Output__
.tag:dps
In RuneScape, the best defence is a great offence. Improving your damage output will significantly increase your chances of success at whichever boss or slayer task you're trying to accomplish. There are little things you can do to optimise once you reach that stage, but initially there are three core ways to increase your damage output:

⬥ Upgrading your gear setup
    • Assuming a starting point of T70 weapons and T70 armour, <#1020045708746833930> will help you upgrade your gear progressively for each combat style.

⬥ Improving your DPS rotation
    • For strong revolution bars with various degrees of ability unlocks, check out <#1136400483284697108>
    • For learning to switch to full manual gameplay, check out <#1020548216258834512>
    • For learning how to start improving your DPM, check out <#1081013603194380359> and <#1019739867032330290>
    • For help and advice, the Helpers and Super Helpers can answer your questions in <#656898197561802760>

⬥ Useful permanent unlocks
    • Permanent unlocks have a multitude of benefits ranging from adrenaline refunds on abilities to enchantments on weapons/gear. For a full list of recommendations, check out <#1025569719056597042>
