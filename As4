> __**Why you should almost never go for Aftershock4 (As4) alone.**__

__**Cost Comparison**__
Aftershock4Equilibrium2(As4e2) costs 3.3x as much as As4.  However, on a *per attempt* basis, As4E2 and As4 cost practically the same amount—6 ilujankan components and 1 ancient weapon gizmo.

__**Damage Gain Comparison**__
To compare how much of a damage increase each of these perks are, let's assume you start out with Precise6 Equilibrium4 weapon perks.

**If you make 1 attempt as As4 alone**
⬥ 96.3% chance of As4.  As4 is a 1.5% DPM boost over E4
⬥ 3.7% chance of As3.
⬥ **On average you will get a 1.44% DPM boost from an As4 attempt.**

**If you make 1 attempt at As4E2**
⬥ 84.6% chance of some kind of As4.
     • 29.6% chance of As4e2.  This is a 2.9% DPM boost compared to E4.
     • 36.4% chance of As4R1.  With 0 ruthless stacks, this is a 1.5% DPM boost.  With 5 ruthless stacks, this is a 3.5% DPM boost.  Let's just assume that you have 5 ruthless stacks 10% of the time.  On average that would make this perk a 1.7% DPM boost.
     • 18.7% chance of plain As4.  This is a 1.5% DPM boost.
⬥ 3.9% chance of getting some form of As3.
⬥ **On average you will get a 1.77% DPM boost from an As4e2 attempt.**  This is the main reason why it is better to go for As4e2 attempts rather than As4.

__**Other considerations**__
⬥ As4e2 perks are BIS, and won't need to be replaced later on when you get more gp.
⬥To get the full chance at As4e2 perks, you do need 120 invention and extreme invention potions.  It is probably better to wait till 120 before going for As4e2. 

__**What scenarios would justify going for a plain As4?**__
⬥ If you are very low invention level AND won't be training invention anytime soon AND you want perks better than p6e4 immediately AND you have money to waste
⬥ If you already have ALL of your As4e2 gizmos and want to perk out a weapon switch such as trimmed masterwork spear.
