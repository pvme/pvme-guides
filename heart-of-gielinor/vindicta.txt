.
*Note: While it is beneficial to follow the rotation, it is not vital to follow it. It is just important to remember that you should ultimate (<:sunshine:994921119381463070>), thresh (<:wm:535533809978966037> twice, <:asphyx:535533833072672778> once ideally)*

.
**__Tips and Tricks__**
⬥ It is possible for your ability to get stalled (casted but not released) when Vindicta flies away, should this occur just run in and click Vindicta *or* hit your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> bind and your next ability
    • If your Guthix Staff Special <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> gets stalled, you will need to ensure your Guthix Staff is on when you release it, otherwise it will not release and you will get refunded your adrenaline.

.
⬥ Avoid Asphxiating <:asphyx:535533833072672778> after Vindicta's Ranged hit as it is very likely you will lose 1 or 2 hits when she flies off
.
⬥ If you need to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, do it when Vindicta uses her Ranged hit in the 2nd phase.
.
⬥ If you followed the rotation, Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> when it is off cooldown and apply Vulnerbility <:Vuln:537349530551582720>
    • If you did not follow the rotation, just use a defensive at ~1 minute mark to apply Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>
.
⬥ To time Target Cycle just spam it *and* run to spot and you will get it, ideally have these binds near one another to make it easy to do
    • Refer to <#1020050319457132654> to set up Target Cycle.
    • Further, it is important to ensure you run and spam the bind, for if you try to Target Cycle without a target it goes on a cooldown which is reset by walking a tile.

**__Gp/hr__**
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C306$
*Note: Assumes Max Reputation and $data_pvme:Bosses!B306$ kph.*
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on healing through Vindicta & Gorvek's near-constant fire damage. It is also important to use the **Animate Dead** spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage.
⬥ It is assumed that you will use a **Legendary Pet** for this setup. If you choose to forego auto-looting and bring a **Ripper Demon** <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> instead, you can expect 2-3 more kills per hour.

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how fast or consistent can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, allowing for faster and more consistent kills. This is going to be your best aura choice, and KPH figures used in this section are based on the usage of this aura.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but is not able to be refreshed like Dark Magic.
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Vindicta & Gorvek, this is a safe aura choice to afk with.
    • <:mani:643505153709965322> **Do __not__ use Maniacal** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows a very afk experience, but is rendered obselete by Penance Powder. It is no longer worth using this aura.

.
⬥ Autocasting Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> with dual-wield magic weapons <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> will be most effective for this setup.

⬥ <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956> **Cryptbloom + Ganodermic Armor** - Magic tank armor is required for **Animate Dead** <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, and the magic damage reduction from Cryptbloom armor is needed to mitigate enough damage for this afk method. While at least 3 pieces of Cryptbloom armor are recommended, you can get away with using 2 with some more added risk. The rest of your non-Cryptbloom armor should be filled out with **Ganodermic or better**.
⬥ <:eof:787526151978614824> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and boosted Soulsplit passive.
⬥ <:channellerring:839903943404027914> **Channeller's Ring** - Can be substituted for other strong rings (Asylum Surgeon's <:asr:513190158472839208> or Ring of Death <:RoD:513190159462825984>).
⬥ <:potionreservoir:878739200407654431> **Potion reservoir** - Can store up to 6 doses of a potion (e.g. overload), and automatically refresh that potion when its duration is low.

⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Vindicta & Gorvek, this is by far the safest and most reliable aura choice to afk with.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not provide anything else. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.
.
⬥ A Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> / Abyssal scourge <:abyssalscourge:947871842469834832> is a good choice for this setup due to their passive effect and accuracy. If you do not have those, other 2-handed melee weapons such as Superior Vesta's Spear <:vestaspear:852661743682846720> or Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.
