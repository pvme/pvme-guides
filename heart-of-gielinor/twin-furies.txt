.tag:intro
The Twin Furies is a Zamorakian boss located in the Heart of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering the boss fight requires 40 (or 20 kc if you have enough rep) and 80 (boostable) Ranged <:range:580168050121113623>. Notable drops include the Crest of Zamorak, which is an ingredient for making T80 and T85 power armor, and the T85 Fury Blades.

The boss itself is the easiest of the four GWD2 fights. The boss is unique in the fact that both targets share the 200k hp pool. This means that an aoe attack will essentially do double damage.

⬥ A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> or Dragonrider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing **double** damage.
⬥ If you're struggling with food conservation and Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is not enough to heal you, you may also use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot.
⬥ An elite Enhanced Excalibur <:excal:641337999170207763> and Ancient Elven Ritual shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.
