Sliske's general in the Heart of Glienor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be one of the harder GWD2 bosses for learners. This is generally due to his high accuracy and hard hits.

**__General Tips__**
⬥ The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off.
    • Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range)
⬥ Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up, waiting for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up.
    • Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to the immunity provided by incense sticks.
⬥ A Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> is used for extra sustain coupled with an <:aosor:544200033847869443> / <:eofor:745279787471470713> is used to increase the effectiveness of protection prayers, making the fight easier.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour than actively killing Gregorovic but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss.
⬥ It is very effective for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> **and** use a Superior/Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> as this method relies on constant healing.
.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you have to pay more attention to prayer points between kills.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but can be a slightly unsafe without a Superior Scrimshaw of Vampyrism.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you lose both the afk-ness of Penance and the safety net that Vampyrism provides.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net slightly less kills per hour compared to the melee AFK setup, and has a ***much higher startup cost***. However, the upkeep cost is significantly cheaper when compared to the melee setup.
⬥ Sometimes you **will need to move to collect your loot.** As you won't be constantly close to Gregorovic, loot will often drop outside of your area-loot range. **Playing on mobile mitigates the need to move due to a larger area loot radius.**
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on constant healing.
.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. You also need to pay more attention to your prayer between kills.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> HP may fluctuate an uncomfortable amount. You will need to pay more attention to your HP between kills.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but similarly to Vampyrism you must pay more attention to prayer points. This should be the most effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not give any extra poison procs. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura.
    • <:reckless:643505179378974748> **Do __not__ use Reckless** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.
.
⬥ A Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> will be one of the most effective weapons for this setup due to its passive. If you do not have one, other 2-handed range weapons should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.
