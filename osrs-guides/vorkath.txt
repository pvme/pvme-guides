Vorkath is accessible after completing Dragon Slayer 2. The quest version of the boss is 2/3 as strong as the version you can farm for consistent GP. Notable drops include the guaranteed 2 superior dragon bones, high chance of rune and dragon alchables, and high tier fletching supplies.

> __**Attack Pattern**__
.tag:Attack_Pattern
Vorkath attacks randomly with all three styles. However, if you are not in melee distance, Vorkath will only alternate between magic and ranged attacks. Vorkath's attack pattern is as follows,

6 normal attacks → special to replace 7th attack → 6 normal attacks → other special to replace 7th attack → repeat

Additionally, Vorkath can also attack with dragonfire. Dragonfire damage taken can be reduced to zero with a combination of super antifire and a dragonfire protection shield (DFS, Ward, Wyvern shield). There are four types of dragonfire:

⬥ **Normal dragonfire**

    • Orange in colour; does damage.

⬥ **Venom dragonfire**

    • Dark green in colour; applies venom.
        - Can be negated with antivenom+ or serpentine helm.

⬥ **Pink dragonfire**

    • Bright pink in colour; deactivates prayers.
        - Setting up quick prayers is advised to help turn them back on quickly.

⬥ **Deadly dragonfire**

    • Looks like fireball attack from Galvek fight in Dragon Slayer 2.
    • 3x3 AoE hit, centred around the player's position at time of launch.
        - It is quite slow; move at least two tiles to dodge it.

> __**Special Attacks**__
.tag:Special_Attacks
The order of Vorkath's special attacks will always alternate; in other words, you cannot get the same special back-to-back. The starting special, however, is random.

__**Acid Phase**__
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Cj0objK.mp4
Vorkath launches out tiles of acid around the arena. After all the acid has landed, Vorkath will begin attacking the player's tile every tick with a high typeless damage attack.

To deal with acid, when you see Vorkath launch the acid in the air, turn off run, or click tile by tile. Path around the acid, or through it, as tanking an acid hit is about half the damage of tanking one of Vorkath's attacks. Vorkath will heal the amount of damage taken via the acid. This special lasts around 16s. Players can still hit Vorkath during the special (known as Woox walking) but Vorkath only takes 50% damage.

__**Zombie Minion**__
.img:https://i.imgur.com/OsVa6hP.mp4
Vorkath freezes the player in place and spawns a zombie dragon spawn. This spawn must be killed before it touches the player otherwise you will take up to 60 damage.

To deal with this minion, cast Crumble Undead from the normal spellbook on it. It will always one-shot the target. Players meleeing Vorkath should bring a staff switch, otherwise it is possible to splash. Vorkath is immune to damage while the player is frozen and the spawn is alive. The special ends as soon as the spawn is killed.

> __**Strategy**__
.tag:Strategy
__**The Fight**__
Vorkath will not begin attacking until poked by the player.

⬥ If using ranged and DHCB + ward, pray protect from missiles (ranged).
⬥ If using melee or a blowpipe, pray protect from magic.

Count his attacks, and keep in mind the attack pattern: 6 attacks, then a special, along with occasional dragonfire. After the first special, and six more attacks, a different special will occur. Past this point, specials will repeat according to the attack pattern until Vorkath is dead.

Once defeated, Vorkath will go back to a sleeping state and can be poked again to restart the fight. Generally, multiple kills are done in a single trip, as allowed by inventory space. Eat food, and ensure to pick up the superior dragon bones, between each kill.

__**Woox Walking**__
An advanced method to continue dpsing during acid phase. Can be done using any weapon speed with varying difficulty.

__**Banking**__
⬥ To reset your HP and stats, use a rejuvination pool in your POH.
    • If no pool, you can also use the ferox enclave pool.
        - Note that the ferox enclave pool will not recharge your special attack.
⬥ The most optimal way to return to Vorkath is to use Fremennik sea boots 4 teleport. The boat to Vorkath is just north.
    • If not unlocked, build a Waterbirth Island portal or Lunar Isle portal inside your POH.
        - If Waterbirth Island portal, take the boat back and you'll be on the dock next to the Vorkath boat.
        - If Lunar Island portal, talk to any banker (except the far right one) to be kicked out to the Rellekka market.
    • If you do not have either portal inside your POH, you can move your house to Rellekka and run north instead.

__**Recovering your items**__
⬥ Should you die Torfinn will hold your items. They can be retrieved for a flat fee of 100k.
⬥ He will not collect the drops you did not pick up. Be sure to pick up anything valuable before starting a new kill!
