> __**Introduction**__
Kerapac is a dragonkin fighting under the control of Jas. Kerapac can be fought in teamsizes of 1-3, in either normal or hard mode.

It is important to note that Kerapac is affected by the Nodon Dragonkin slayer task. The slayer helmet <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> bonus, genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> bonus, and the <:premierartefact:918517285176623104> Premier Artefact slayer boost (10% chance to stop slayer count decreasing) will work on Kerapac; however, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> will not be boosted, Dragon Slayer <:dragonslayerperk:689502927731163170> <:dragonslayer:641339921814126594> does not work, and Dragon Bane equipment <:bane2h:859483155210567741> does not work.

> __**Drops**__
.tag:drops
Kerapac's drops include three components to create the tier 95 Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451>, and a pet with a new skin unlocked at 1,000 Hard Mode kills. He always drops 3 piles of loot regardless of teamsize. In a solo, a player will receive all 3 drops; in a trio, each player receives a drop; in a duo, the highest DPS receives two drops and the other receives one drop.

> __**Kerapac's Attack Rotation**__
.tag:kerapacrot
Kerapac's attack rotation on both Normal and Hard Mode is as follows for phases 1, 2 and 3. The attack rotation resets upon starting the next phase.
⬥ 3 attacks
⬥ Shatter
⬥ 3 attacks
⬥ Jumping Slam
⬥ 3 attacks
⬥ Lightning Strike
⬥ 7 attacks
⬥ Repeat until phased

On phase 4, Kerapac will only use auto-attacks.

The entire attack rotation as well as an explanation of mechanics can be summarised in the image below.

.tag:mechanics
__**Time-threads**__
When Kerapac reaches 50,000 HP, he will negate damage taken from all sources, add an Echo of Kerapac to his special attacks on the next phase, and fully restore his Life Points. Each Echo's special attacks mimics the position of Kerapac in the previous phase. There is one Echo per player in phase 2, and two Echos per player in phase 3.

.
__**Shatter**__
Kerapac will slam his staff to the ground, and fires a projectile per player that stuns players in its path. This projectile generates a time rift that fires 5 green projectiles that deal 800-1000 damage each. It is recommended to either use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> preemptively. Alternatively, this attack can be dodged with a well-timed Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or perfect movement.

In Hard Mode, this attack will spawn time rifts with 15,000 HP and damage players for around 500 damage every few ticks, until killed. The green projectiles also deal double damage.

.
__**Jumping Slam**__
Kerapac will fly into the air and dive into the ground a total of 3 times, stunning players in a 7x7 AoE and dealing 2000+ melee damage every tick until the player moves away from it. Every slam also cancels the effects of Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> if it is active, and clears the duration of Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> and Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> if used. Using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> on the proper tick will completely dodge the attack, as well as reset the cooldown of these mobility abilities.

It is highly recommended to upgrade your Pontifex Shadow ring <:pontifexshadowring:870326852361789501> with 1,000 Resonant anima of Jas <:animaofjas:869284271532146768>. Doing so prevents you from getting stunned by the slams altogether.
*Note: If not overcharged, the ring has to be equipped to prevent the stun*

.
__**Lightning Strike**__
Kerapac will raise his staff to the air and generate a wall of lightning from a random direction, dealing 2000-4000 damage every tick. The lightning must be passed through using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>. Alternatively, defensives such as Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> will reduce the damage of this attack. The lightning has a very large hitbox that is disjointed from its animation, so be wary of dodging it.

Beware of phasing Kerapac while he is using this attack, as the lightning will continue to persist through phase 4.

.
__**Warp Time**__
From phase 2 onwards, players gain the Warp Time ability <:timewarp:870328868815396914>, which can be activated using the extra action button. When activated, your current position, HP, prayer points, adrenaline, ability and powerburst cooldowns are tracked. After 10 seconds, all of these stats are reset to the point of activation and you are teleported to the position of activation. The button can be clicked to end the effect early, although this will cancel the time warp. Active buffs (e.g. Berserk) are still active after the time warp. Channels persist if you are in the same location as the warp, or within range of your target.

Warp Time keeps track at the end of a tick, so make sure to activate it before using your adrenaline or abilities.

This action has a 30 second cooldown and has a 10 second activation time. One example of using Warp Time <:timewarp:870328868815396914> is when you are at 100% adrenaline and you are about to use your ultimate ability <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. You can activate Warp Time, use your ultimate, build and dump any adrenaline gained during the 10 second period, then regain 100% adrenaline resetting your ultimate cooldown.

.
__**Fury**__
On phase 4, Kerapac becomes enraged and gains "Kerapac's Fury". Each stack of Fury makes Kerapac deal 1% additional damage and reduces the effectiveness of protection prayers and deflect curses by 0.25%. He starts with 5 stacks of Fury and gains 10 stacks for every additional auto-attack.

On phase 4 of Hard Mode, Kerapac does not gain enrage through auto-attacks. Instead, he starts with 25 stacks of Fury and gains 50 stacks for each echo of Kerapac that is defeated, and 25 stacks for each player echo that is killed.

.
__**Overcharge and Echoes**__
On phase 4 of Hard Mode, Kerapac becomes invulnerable and summons three echoes of both himself and the players. Each echo of Kerapac gains damage reduction unless the player steps into the time-thread of the corresponding player echo. The player will take on the echo's HP that they switched into, and other player echoes will only use auto-attacks against Kerapac's echoes. Due to the fury mechanic of this phase, it is important that you defeat Kerapac's echoes as fast as possible, while keeping as many of your own echoes alive as you can.

In solo, the most effective way of dealing with the three echoes is through making use of Warp Time <:timewarp:870328868815396914>. Position yourself between two echoes, activate Warp Time <:timewarp:870328868815396914> and use your ultimates, and defeat the first two echoes using the adrenaline gained from Warp Time <:timewarp:870328868815396914>. It is recommended to let your third echo die, then position yourself between Kerapac and his third echo. Use your ultimates again and defeat the final echo, then focus Kerapac. You can also make use of Warp Time <:timewarp:870328868815396914> to reset your Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> as Kerapac and his echoes deal extremely high damage with fury stacks.

__**Explanation**__
This method will reliably allow you to get consistent Kerapac (NM) kills without needing much input or effort. It is recommended to have a slayer task (with slayer helm on your anachronia slayer lodge stand) when using this method, but it is not mandatory.

⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Kerapac, this is by far the safest and most reliable aura choice to afk with.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not give any extra poison procs. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura.
    • <:reckless:643505179378974748> **Do __not__ use Reckless** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

⬥ This method requires you to teleport out after each fight to Wars' Retreat. There you should bank, heal to full or close to full, and channel the adrenaline crystals till 100% adrenaline before entering the fight again.

⬥ You should be using the soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> prayer for phases 1-3 and then switching to deflect magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> for p4.

⬥ This method requires using an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, due to hit chance constraints.

.
