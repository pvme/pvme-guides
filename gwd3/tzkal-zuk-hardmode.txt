.tag:intro
TzKal-Zuk is the general of the Ful Front of the Elder GodWars. This encounter is the third version of the Fight Caves/Fight Kiln, in that you fight waves of enemies before taking on the main boss.

**__Flawless Run Vs. No-Checkpoint Run__**
⬥ Flawless Run: No checkpoints used plus successful completion of challenge waves (Waves 5, 10, 15). Unlocks the ability to create the tribrid cape. Does NOT increase drop rates more than No-Checkpoint Runs.
⬥ No-Checkpoint Run: No checkpoints used. Doing this offers the maximum drop rates for unique items. (The chance of finding a Sword Piece is 1/30, increasing to 1/27 if no checkpoints are used. All other unique drops remain unaffected regardless of checkpoint status.)

*Note: Feel free to trade some of the armour here for more tank gear or obsidian gear based on comfort level and budget. If any obsidian armour piece is used, it is also beneficial to donate Tokkul to the coffer at the Fight Cauldron; doing so will provide an extra 10% damage reduction for 20 minutes per 15,000 Tokkul donated, which can be stacked up to 3 times for a maximum duration of an hour.*

We are still currently waiting on writers to make a more formal guide, but here are some quick tips that people have found helpful.

> **__Challenge Tips For Flawless Run__**
.tag:tips
These tips aren't for efficiency, but they will help you get the one-time flawless run needed to upgrade the cape to the tribrid version.
⬥ Have the Igneous magic cape equipped for the upgraded Omnipower <:omni:535533809664262179>, as well as Greater chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> and Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> unlocked.
⬥ Don't fully damage Zuk after waves 4 and 9. Leave about 20k damage and repeat the phase.
    • This lets you set up a  Incite fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and Sunshine on Zuk to prepare for the challenge.
        - Wave 5: Phase Zuk, continue building adrenaline and when the 5 Volatile TzekHaar-Hurs spawn, target one and Greater chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> → <:omni:535533809664262179>, change targets and Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Dragon breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, change targets and Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, change targets and Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Guthix Staff EoF <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>. Kill any survivors with good basics or more Guthix Staff EoF <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>.
        - Wave 10: Phase Zuk, continue building adrenaline and when the Unbreakable TzekHaar-Ket spawns, hit it with <:omni:535533809664262179> and either a threshold or Guthix Staff EoF <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> to kill it.
        - Wave 15: Make sure you can get to 100% adren to Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689>.

.tag:misc
⬥ Standing on this tile blocks enemies from the north and also prevents fires from spawning on you. Enemies from the west can still attack, and you can attack them.

⬥ Here is a helpful lure strategy to lower damage taken during Igneous waves (4, 9, 14)
.img:https://i.imgur.com/NKxD9V7.png
    • Start at the yellow x and kill the Igneous TzekHaar-Xil, then run 2 tiles south, and a couple tiles east so you won't hit the rock when surging north.
        - Moving south gets the eastern TzekHaar-Ket-Zek unstuck, so it will try to move towards you, and get stuck at your new lure spot.
    • Here is a video demonstration of the lure:
