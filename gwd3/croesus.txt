**__Introduction__**
Croesus is the general of the Bik front in the Elder God Wars and has the unique attribute of being a skilling boss. There is no combat involved in the fight, instead the fishing, mining, woodcutting, and hunter skills are used to gather material in order to repair statues that subdue the boss, allowing you to damage its core through skilling. You can fail the encounter, but you will not die, and is safe for Hardcore Ironmen.

The boss is massable, however the recomended group size starts at 8, going down to 4 once you are comfortable with the fight.

.tag:tips
**__Consumables__**
⬥ **Using Crystal Mask** <:crystalmask:892342109829464094>
    • Crystal Mask will fully block **one stat drain hit** from ANY mechanic that targets the player. Using it helps act as a safeguard in case of lag or a slow reaction, and can be used to fully ignore Slime Moulds. This will NOT stop a Fairy Ring from teleporting you, Hard Fungus from stunning you, or Sticky Fungus from rooting you.

⬥ **Skilling Equipment/Potions** <:gathererscape:892342110177624084> / <:perfectplus:892342110030798858>
    • Bringing relevant skilling equipment can greatly improve the speed and overall efficiency of the encounter. If Fishing or Hunting, the elite skilling outfits can help by doubling resources. Relevant tools and other skilling outfits will also aid in success rate (Pickaxe/Hatchet/Magic Net/Fishing Rod-o-matic).
    • Perfect Plus or Perfect Juju Potions can be used to increase gathering rates for skills in the encounter.
    • Stat boosting potions can be used when the core opens up to increase damage dealt to Croesus.

**__Unlocks__**
⬥ **Bladed Dive/Surge** <:bd:535532854281764884> / <:surge:535533810004262912>
    • Bladed Dive and Surge help move around the arena faster to deal with mechanics sooner. On top of this, Surge + Bladed Dive in the same tick can allow players to traverse the East and West paths instantly without getting stats drained.

⬥ **Perks** <:ancienttoolgizmo2:697405383572193311>
    • Skilling equipment should be augmented and equipped with the highest tier of the Honed perk available if possible. No other skilling perks are relevant to the encounter.

⬥ **Shadow's Grace** <:shadowsgrace:895999229737185280>
    • This relic can be used to avoid needing an offhand switch for mobile while using skilling offhands.

**__Contribution Points__**
Throughout the encounter, players will gain Contribution Points for performing beneficial actions. Having more points will increase the number of rewards given at the end of a kill. Getting knocked out by having a stat fully drained will drop contribution points to 0, and no loot will be given.

.
**__Strength Gauge__**
⬥ The orange bar underneath Croesus's health represents Croesus's strength, effectively acting as an enrage timer for the encounter. Anyone getting stats drained by a mechanic will increase the bar by 1% per drain, and failing to remove the Energy Fungus will increase the bar by 40%. Passively, the bar increases at about 8% per minute. If Croesus is alive and its core not exposed when the bar hits 100%, players will fail the encounter.

⬥ In the event that Croesus still has remaining LP after the four statues have been activated, **the strength bar will immediately reach 100% and players will fail the encounter**.

.
**__Dead Beasts__**
⬥ Players must gather from the monster corpses around the arena to repair statues and prevent fungus from regenerating on them. The following corpses and colors correspond with the following skills:
    • Arraxyte | Red | Woodcutting
    • Giant Mole | Yellow | Mining
    • Crassian Leviathan | Green | Fishing
    • Dagganoth Rex | Blue | Hunter

⬥ Gathering
    • A resource node will slowly deplete the corpse and award 2 contribution points per successful action.
    • A glowing resource node will deplete the corpse faster, and award 3 contribution points per successful action.
    • A rotten node will give Rotton Fungus and award no contribution points.
    • A Guard corpse nearby will provide materials, but award no contribution points.

.
⬥ Upon fully depleting a corpse of resources, a player may acquire 10 Rotten Fungus and attempt to gather from the corpse again. Doing so will rot the corpse, slowing down its regeneration rate. This awards 20 contribution points.
    • Depletion of a corpse is indicated by all nodes being dark and a light blue progress bar filling above it.
    • Rotten Fungus can be obtained by left clicking any gathered fungus in one's inventory, or having one forcefully rotted by getting stats drained.
    • If a corpse is NOT depleted, damage dealt to Croesus's core will be reduced.
.

⬥ Croesus sends out mechanics at roughly these times in the fight (mechanic breakdown below):
    • 00:14: Red Spore Bomb
    • 00:23: Fairy Ring
    • 00:38: Slime Mould
    • 00:51: Yellow Spore Bomb
    • 01:03: Hard Fungus Fall (Stun)
    • 01:12: Sticky Fungus
    • 01:26: Green Spore Bomb
    • 01:37: Fairy Ring
    • 01:51: Slime Mould
    • 02:03: Blue Spore Bomb
    • 02:14: Hard Fungus Fall (Stun)
    • 02:23: Sticky Fungus & Energy Fungus

.
**__Spore Bombs__**
Croesus will fire a Spore Bomb at players, leaving a 3x3 AoE that will drain stats by 15 levels (11 with Pontifex Ring). The color of the AoE corresponds to the stat drained:
⬥ Red: Woodcutting
⬥ Yellow: Mining
⬥ Green: Fishing
⬥ Blue: Hunter
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/OblongPossibleFeline.mp4
.
**__Fairy Rings__**
Croesus will spawn a Fairy Ring under players, indicated by dust particle effects underneath them. Not moving away will teleport the player to a random location within the arena.
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/VibrantMasculineFirebelliedtoad.mp4
.
**__Slime Mould__**
Croesus will fire a Slime Mould near players which chases them. The Slime Mould can get stuck behind obstacles or ran away from.
⬥ Getting hit by this will drain stats by 25% (18.75% with Pontifex Ring).

⬥ *This mechanic can be entirely blocked by Crystal Mask, effectively allowing you to ignore the Slime Mould.*
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/FelineWearyHairstreak.mp4
.
**__Hard Fungus Fall__**
Croesus will fire a Hard Fungus at players, stunning them if hit. This can be dodged, or the stun mitigated by using Anticipate or Freedom.
⬥ Getting stunned and failing to mitigate it will drain stats by 20% (15% with Pontifex Ring).

⬥ *Anticipate and Freedom do not interrupt skilling actions, and therefore should be used if gathering when this mechanic happens.*
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/BonyBarrenCougar.mp4
.
**__Sticky Fungus__**
Croesus will spawn Sticky Fungus under some players feet, holding them in place until it is burned away or drains stats four times.
⬥ Players can free themselves and others either by bringing logs <:proteanlog:892342109930143784> in their inventory (Proteans work), or wielding an **Orthen Furnace Core** <:orthenfurnacecore:892342109892399125> or **Sana's Fyrtorch** <:sanasfyrtorch:892342109842079766> in their offhand slot. Freeing another player awards 10 contribution points.

⬥ Stats are drained by 10% (7.5% with Pontifex Ring) each interval the player is not freed.

⬥ Every other Sticky Fungus mechanic is accompanied by the Energy Fungus mechanic.

.
**__Energy Fungus__**
Croesus will spawn an Energy Fungus next to them in each of the four quadrants. Players must click on this fungus to remove it, gaining 5 contribution points per tick.
⬥ If the Energy Fungus is not removed, Croesus will gain 40% Rot.
.

.
**__Statue Restoration__**
Once enough materials have been deposited at a statue, it can be restored by players. Restoration awards Construction experience and 1 contribution point per xp drop.
⬥ Wielding the **Artificer's Measure** offhand has a chance to increase progress and speed up the overall restoration. You will gain extra points when its effect procs, so there is no downside to using this.

⬥ The **Master Contructor's Outfit** provides a similar effect as above.
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/SociableFortunateCatbird.mp4
.
**__Statue Prayers__**
⬥ Once a statue is fully restored, it may be prayed to. Doing so will expose Croesus's core and halts progress on the Strength Bar.

⬥ Each statue prayed to will increase the time that the core is exposed. It is ideal to pray to 3 or 4 statues at the same time to maximize time spent damaging the core.
.
.img:https://giant.gfycat.com/FatherlyEminentBinturong.mp4
.
**__Exposed Core__**
⬥ Upon praying to the statues, Croesus's core will be revealed as one of four skilling nodes. Gathering from the core will damage Croesus based on the player's level in the relevant stat.

⬥ Assuming all monster corpses are depleted, damage dealt to the core will be **[Current Level] * 15**. If no corpses are depleted, damage dealt will simply be equal to the player's current level in the relevant stat. Stat boosts in the relevant skill will increase damage dealt.
    • If a fungal stew for the corresponding skill is used, damage dealt will be increased by **50%**.
    • Damage is dealt on every successful gathering action, awarding 1 contribution point per 500 damage each hit.
.

.
**__Core Particles__**
While gathering from Croesus's core, particles will occasionally spawn from its base. Clicking the core again while these particles are present will have the following effects based on their color:
⬥ White: Deals an extra 500 poison damage.
⬥ Green: Deals an extra 1,000 poison damage, gains 1 contribution point.
⬥ Red: **Heals the boss for 2,500 LP, deducts 5 contribution points.**

.
The current meta to maximize contribution points while maintaining decent kill times is to restore all 4 statues, then wait until the Energy Fungi spawn in the middle, kill it, then pray at all 4 statues simultaneously to expose the core for its maximum duration to kill it in one cycle. The core can be killed faster by only restoring 3 statues and skipping the Energy Fungus, but that results in a huge loss of contribution points so it is not worth doing.
