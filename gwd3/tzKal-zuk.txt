*Note: Feel free to trade some of the armour here for more tank gear or obsidian gear based on comfort level and budget. If any obsidian armour piece is used, it is also beneficial to donate Tokkul to the coffer at the Fight Cauldron; doing so will provide an extra 10% damage reduction for 20 minutes per 15,000 Tokkul donated, which can be stacked up to 3 times for a maximum duration of an hour.*

.tag:aken
**__Wave 17__**
⬥ This is the last enemy before fighting TzKal-Zuk. His head will appear for about 40 seconds when the wave starts. He has a lot of tentacles (Mage and Ranged) which will constantly attack dealing small damage.
    • After 40 seconds, his head will submerge for about 50 seconds, in which time you can kill some of the tentacles and use defensive abilities to mitigate some damage. You do not need to kill any tentacles finish the phase. Just the head needs to die.
    • He has a mechanic that shoots a blob to your location that drains your adrenaline by 10% immediately and makes you gain 50% reduced adrenaline for a short time.
        - When his head is exposed, he only fires 1 blob at a time.
        - When he submerges, he fires blobs that expand into a 5x5 `X` shape at your players location. These can be dodge by moving out of the way.

> **__TzKal-Zuk__**
.tag:zuk
He Primarily attacks with melee.

**__Mechanics:__**
Zuk does a mechanic after every 3 auto attacks in normal mode. The mechanics appear in order as follows, and will repeat once all mechanics have happened.
⬥ **Geothermal Burn:** Zuk shouts `You will break beneath me!` and applies a magic bleed that lasts for 20 seconds.
    • The bleed can be stopped by using Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.

⬥ **Sear:** Zuk shouts `Sear!` or `Suffer!` and hits you with a melee hit and 2 magic hits, and lowers your constitution level.
    • You need to travel 15 total tiles to stop the hp drain, and drink super restores to clear the debuff.
    • This mechanic can be mostly negated instantly by using (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> as soon as Zuk does the spec, which will be his 4th attack after the last spec, and running back to where you started.
.
⬥ **Quake:** Zuk shouts `Tremble before me!` or `Fall before my might!` and causes the floor to crack in small areas around him that deal a lot of damage and apply an escalating magic bleed if stood in.
    • This mechanic can be mostly negated instantly by using (Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> as soon as Zuk does the spec, which will be his 4th attack after the last spec, and dpsing from your new location.

⬥ **Empowered Magic:** Zuk shouts `Die!` `Begone!` or `Ful's power flows through me!` and shoots a projectile at you that deals high soft-typeless damage.
    • You can use Disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> to take 0 damage from this.

⬥ **Igneous Rain:** Zuk shouts `Flames consume you!` or `Burn!` and jump to the middle of the room, becoming immune to attacks, stunning and dragging you, and covering all but one section of the arena with fire that ramps up damage the longer you stand in it.
    • You can use Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to get to the safe part of the arena, where an igneous mob will be waiting for you to kill.
        - Kill these the same way as in waves 4, 9, and 14. Use the extra action button to interrupt the mechanic. If you fail to interrupt it, it will instakill you.

It should be noted that Zuk will skip the first 3 auto attacks and go into the Geothermal Burn mechanic as soon as the encounter starts. In addition, when Zuk hits 100k lifepoints, he will restart his attack rotation, starting with the Geothermal Burn.
