## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
.
The Magister is a boss residing at the very end of the Sophanem Slayer Dungeon. The fight requires 115 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> drops, used to create the T92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> <:khopeshoh:513206794752098327> , with vital sparks <:vitalspark:656426807893032963> and Gloves of Passage <:Glovesofpassage:556588694862037012> being other sought-after drops.

It is highly recommended to have at least T90 weapons and to be on a Berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> and Genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> perk effects do not work.

### Familiar Choice
Magister has very high defense so if undergeared, it is generally a good idea to consider using a Nihil <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> to limit splashing. However, with T92+ weapons and zerk aura <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:mani:643505153709965322> you are able to obtain essentially 100% accuracy so a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls is a stronger choice.

High end melee with a Vampyrism Scrimshaw can utilize a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> to achieve more passive dps than a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls.

## __Protecting Your Familiar__
.tag:familiars
The main recommended familiars are a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, a Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>, or a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> (high end melee only). All of these familiars have relatively low lifepoints, particularly the ancient summoning familiars, so some attention is needed in order to keep your familiar alive.

.
### Tricks to Protect Your Familiar
⬥ Try to kick the Unstable Mixture at the Magister if your familiar is about to die, as this will otherwise frequently hit your familiar for 2,000 damage.
    • 5 Mixtures hitting your Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> will kill it, 6 Mixtures will kill your Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, and 10 will kill your Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>.
⬥ Pray at War's Altar in War's Retreat between trips to restore your familiar's hitpoints.

.
## __Strategy__
.tag:strats
### General
⬥ Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers.
    • Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation.
.
⬥ Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase.
    • This only really applies to the range weapons at 9 tiles when he is bound.
    • This also implies that he will sometimes phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly, meaning you should be wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated.
.
⬥ For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall.
    • Don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill.
⬥ If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set.
