### Introduction
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>.

Each solo run of ED3 is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!E568$ in eldritch pieces. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B571$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C571$ gp/hr.

During group encounters each player can roll an Eldritch piece individually.
Solo - (180/10,000) Duo - (90/10,000) Trio - (60/10,000)
.
### General Notes
⬥ The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation.
⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.
⬥ Consider downgrading your graphics to Minimum with Medium+ draw distance for the Dungeon, as it is poorly optimised and prone to frame drops.
⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.

### General Notes
⬥ Two presets are sufficient for the Reef, the second one is for The Ambassador, as Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> and Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> are used for the fight.
    • <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** will **not** improve unique drop rates.
⬥ Reckless <:reckless:643505179378974748> is the best aura for the dungeon, followed by Inspiration <:inspiration:643505652634746881> then Mahjarrat <:mahj:643148943856762890>.

⬥ <:ed3luckycharm:841409588938276874> **Lucky Charms** are optional, they average up to 1.2m per run.
    • Tokens are better spent on Port Enhancers for Superior Scrimshaws or obtaining Seasinger weapons.
    • These don't enhance Eldritch piece drop rates.
⬥ <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> Kal'gerion demon is best used in this dungeon.

.
### Room 1
⬥ Attack the closest Crassian scout and wait until both scouts are stacked. For the sake of consistency Dark Bow <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> the Scouts into good abilities for the Crabs.
    • You can attempt to stack Crabs + Crassians, but its very inconsistent.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/gPMiH54.mp4
.
### Room 2
⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> → Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> → Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> / Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> for the Scouts → strong abilities for the Crabs.
    • Don't use Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> or Binding Shot <:tight:535541275957657600> for this room.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/xf1J9yh.mp4
.
### Room 3
⬥ Wait a tick, Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> the middle Scout closest to the gate, into Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, cleaning up as seen fit.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/WbAVVLH.mp4
.
### Room 4
⬥ Burst the two Zealots with anything at your disposal. You can immediately use a Powerburst of Acceleration <:accel:756236265472524418> to reset your Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> if its on cooldown.

### Room 5
⬥ Target a Zealot with Corruption Shot <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> and move back to the spot shown below, this will stack the 2 Zealots + 1 Scout together.
    • You can activate <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> as you move back. Keep it on for all enemies.
⬥ Swap out to a stronger weapon for the single Scout remaining to finish it off.
.

### Room 6
⬥ Put on your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and target as seen fit.
    • Luring is intuitive here as their position is completely random.

.
### Room 7
⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and target the closest Zombie into Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>. Wait for it to detonate then <:grico:787904334812807238> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>.

### Room 8
⬥ Manage your adrenaline to be at least 100% for Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> and don't pray any Deflects or Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>.
    • Alternatively, with an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> in your Essence of Finality <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, you can Split Soul here with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snipe:535541258425204770>.

## __The Crassian Leviathan__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/hHWBVqywIK.png
.
As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss heals passively over the duration of the fight, greatly reduced by having Weapon Poison active.

.
### Mechanics
⬥ **Poisonous Breath** - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy typeless damage and contaminating the arena. Never stand in the centre nor in front of the Leviathan.
    • The **Poison Pit** poisons and stuns the player if stood upon.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/RCt6T7m.mp4
.
⬥ **Many Heads** - The Leviathan has additional heads that will stun and poison you in the contaminated zones if you are near them.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/YDfiuOf.mp4
.
⬥ **Head Sweep** - The Leviathan will slam its head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area, avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/5sWppnG.mp4
.
⬥ **Tactical Retreat** - After going through one **Dragon Breath** and two sets of **Head Sweeps**, the Leviathan will move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation.
    • Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> back to his main head once this happens to prevent getting stunned.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/3iANozs.mp4
.
### Strategy
Defensive + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> → Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> → Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> (roughly at the middle of his head) + <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> + Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135> → Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → improvise

Your primary objective is to fit in 2 Rapid Fire's <:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 Snap Shot's <:snap:535534127131394088>, 4 Greater Ricochet's <:grico:787904334812807238>, 2 Corruption Shot's <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, and a varying number of Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> depending on your adrenaline.

*Note: Any bleed used will be considered walked as he moves to the opposite side of the arena, use this to your advantage if you're getting 2 cycles.*

## __Post-Crassian - Second Floor Entry__
.tag:PCSFE
.
### Room 1
⬥ Acceleration Pot <:accel:756236265472524418> and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> your way to the Zealot and Crabs.
    • 1 cycling Crassian will allow you to have an extra Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> in case of messing up.
⬥ Stay at melee distance of the Zealot and kill all the relevant mobs.

.
### Room 1 (Artefacts)
⬥ Equip your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:eofgreen:780401412727242773>
    • Kill the Necromancer to the West and interact with the guarded artefact.
    • Kill the Necromancer to the East and interact with the guarded artefact.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/J00uP0Z.mp4
.
*Note: When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping your Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal.*

.
### Room 2 (Bridge)
⬥ Target the Necromancer with a stalled Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> + Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> release with a 9sq weapon from this square move back → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> then back in to stack the Horrors and the Necromancer for a <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>. Afterwards you have two options:
    • The safe clear is being at a distance from the horrors, cleaning up as seen fit.
    • Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> melee distance → Western Horror with <:grico:787904334812807238> → Eastern Horror with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, cleaning up as seen fit.

### Room 4
⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> as demonstrated to avoid aggro from the Sotapanna's.
⬥ Apply Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> and wait for detonation before clearing the mobs.
⬥ Once in position, use Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546> on a Necromancer to stack all relevant mobs together.
    • The gate opens when the 2 Necromancers, and 2 Huge Skeletons are killed.

It's easier to triple Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> for this line instead, it'll just be slightly slower as demonstrated below.

*Faster form*
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/mYnzcHG.mp4

*Triple BD - Easier form*
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/LAvCAjK.mp4
.
*Note: Judge accordingly if you need (or want) to do a full clear to get adrenaline and / or bank comfortably, with enough speed the Zombie(s) and / or Sotapanna(s) will not reach you in time.*

## __Taraket the Necromancer__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/1qztt5mzjF.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket, Corpses and Skeletons are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> , Undead Slayer perk <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and sigil <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> purposes.

.
## __Mechanics__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** - This Rift with 30k HP will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/Xq8JxyR.mp4
.
    • If left alive, the Rift will detonate for up to 9,000 hard typeless damage.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/lNWdkWt.mp4
.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos are slightly stronger than his Magic ones.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/pkwjo5O.mp4
.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each.
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs until its death.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/L3klbH8.mp4
.
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's auto-attacks.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/LeJAsiN.mp4
.
        ⬩ Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed.
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards.
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket.

.
⬥ **Spirit Wall** - Taraket smashes the ground in front of him for heavy melee damage, summoning a line of spirits in front of him that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact.
    • Move out of the way as needed be.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ESTxXSQ.mp4
.
⬥ **Absorb Undead** - Periodically, Taraket may absorb all skeletons in the arena to heal 2,000 per skeleton.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/Kqlh96V.mp4
.
### Strategy
The use of Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> after using your Essence of Finalities <:eofor:745279787471470713> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the gate.
⬥ Gauge when will it be appropriate to Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as their positions are largely random.
    • A Chin SGB <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> can be used here for a surprisingly decent amount of spread out damage.
    • If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> in your Essence of Finality <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, you may attempt to Split Soul here with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

    • Equip a stronger weapon if they're too far apart from each other.
    • If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> in your Essence of Finality <:eofspec:746403211908481184>, you may attempt to Split Soul here with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

    • Zealots may aggro independently of one another, ruining the lure. You can fix it by dragging **all** Zealots and walking back to the gate you came from.
        ⬩ Skeletons ought to be killed first, and at the same time as you are luring the Zealots.
⬥ Try to stack all mobs if possible., using Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> to prioritise the Skeleton's death.

### Room 4
⬥ Hug the West wall to reduce the chance of the minibosses aggro'ing you, should they aggro alternate Anticipation <:anti:535541306475151390> and Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.
⬥ Activate Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>, wait for detonation before clearing the room.
    • Don't worry too much if the mini-bosses attack you, simply bind them / teleport out quickly after the gate is open to bank comfortably.
    • A faster but slightly riskier way to get there is through this Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> as shown below:
.

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
### 1M-550K HP
⬥ **Black Stone Flames**
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head.
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until Seiryu clears them at the Ritual phase.
    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks.
        ⬩ These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and will ramp up to 2000 typeless damage to anyone standing inside.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/5bWwQXr.mp4
.
⬥ **Unstable Black Hole**
    • The Ambassador will spawn an unstable black hole near the area that is despawned by stunning it.

.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/mOScu8K.mp4
.
⬥ **Tribeam & Sinister Fragments**
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute.
    • The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
        ⬩ The entry gate is located East of the arena.
    • He'll use the Fragments every full attack rotation **or** by hitting the 650K cap until the next phase commences.

*Tribeam Unleashed*
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/Vg7ztvk.mp4
.
    • Failing to destroy a fragment(s) prompts the Ambassador to absorb them, and release a **Pulse of Erebus** per absorption, dealing 8,000 soft typeless damage.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/3U8LBRS.mp4
.
### 550K-400K HP
⬥ Tribeam, Sinister Fragments and Pulse of Erebusa are no longer used.
⬥ The Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage, making Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> harder to use.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/GuVOe7f.mp4
.
### 400K-0 HP
⬥ Black Stone Flames and Unstable Black Holes are no longer used.
⬥ Seiryu intervenes shortly after, healing you to full.

.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/q39LXoM.mp4
.
⬥ A circle of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena.

.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/lzYID2k.mp4
.
        ⬩ An unblocked projectile will heal the Ambassador for 2500HP.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/OJdaot8.mp4
.
        ⬩ Standing between the Ambassador and the projectiles will make them black, damaging you for a small typeless hit but will **not** heal the Ambassador.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/h6f0cFc.mp4
.
⬥ **Shadow Onslaught**
    • Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/xPYzNrs.mp4
.
### Strategy
⬥ **1M-650k**
*Note: All Unstable Black Holes will be cleared with Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> / Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546>.*

    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and equip Ruby bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>.

.
<:deathsswift:994921434633744455> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → improvise → Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> the Unstable Black Hole.

    • Due to the great variance of adrenaline with the usage of critical hits and bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>, this rotation can be tweaked if needed be.
    • Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be used by standing directly underneath him, or by standing South when he summons the Black Hands.

.
⬥ **Tribeam**
    • Activate Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> and Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> as soon as possible.
    • <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only once at the start.
    • At the 6th Fragment you will build to this rotation: Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> → Basics → Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> → Basics → Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> → Basics Defensives / Bleeds → Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> → More Basics.
        ⬩ The cue to start this setup is roughly at 46s from Spinner start. Any further increases the risk of having to rely on Hydrix bolt <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> and Relentless procs for the setup.

.
⬥ **After Tribeam**
    • With Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> active at all times, your priority is to **spam** Dark Bow's <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as much as possible, saving Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737> for the Ritual.
        ⬩ This rotation is RNG-reliant and demands improvisation if your procs / crits fall short.
    • Use at least one Seren Godbow spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
    • With a good damage output, your Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> will be on cooldown as ritual starts. Adapt accordingly with a Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> shortly before the Ritual begins.

.
⬥ **Ritual**
*Note: Not necessarily the start of the ritual, but rather when your Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> is finally off-cooldown.*

<:deathsswift:994921434633744455> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:vitality:654618235097972737> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → improvise

If you're going to get a second Mage Onslaught **don't** use Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> + <:rapid:535541270521708566>, save it for Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> + Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737>
