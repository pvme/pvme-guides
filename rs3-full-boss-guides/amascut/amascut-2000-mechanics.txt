⬥ Right hand <:melee:1096130867279171706> AoE attack on tank that ricochets as <:range:580168050121113623> attacks on the other players. <:range:580168050121113623> ricochet has a 10-tile range.
⬥ Three rapid <:melee:1096130867279171706> or <:magic:689504724159823906> swipes on the tank. The style depends on her last auto-attack: For example: if it was <:magic:689504724159823906>, the three hits will be <:magic:689504724159823906>.
    • The following autos are based on your protection or deflect prayer on the first swipe hit. If you prayed wrong against it, the following auto-attacks will be the same type as the swipe hit.
⬥ After three autos, Amascut starts a new mechanic at 100% adrenaline.

.
### Phase 1 (12000k)
⬥ 3 autos → Triple Tap → swipes → 2 autos → Summon Scarabs → 1 auto → swipes → 1 auto → Crushing Soul → 2 autos → swipes → Empowered Eruption → 3 autos → Triple Tap → swipes → 2 autos → phase 2

**Triple Tap**
⬥ Amascut says `Grovel`, `pathetic` or `weak` and will launch three projectiles in the air, with each colour corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>) on the tank. These will hit the tank two ticks apart.
    • `Grovel`: <:magic:689504724159823906> → <:melee:1096130867279171706> → <:range:580168050121113623>
    • `Pathetic`: <:melee:1096130867279171706> → <:range:580168050121113623> → <:magic:689504724159823906>
    • `Weak`: <:range:580168050121113623> → <:magic:689504724159823906> → <:melee:1096130867279171706>
.
**Summon Scarabs**
⬥ Amascut says `Tear them apart` and summons Volatile Scarab Akhs. They need to be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369> to take damage. Will explode if left alone, dealing typeless damage.
    • Damage can be blocked by <:cade:535541306353778689> and spawn prevented by being near their burrow location.
.
**Crushing Soul**
⬥ Amascut says `Bend the knee` and deals big typeless damage on the tank. Has defensive penetration. Damage can be shared with nearby teammates (3x3?).
    • At 2000% to tsurvive this solo, use <:immort:535541258538582017>
    • Teams can have the DPS pile <:voke:535541259465392143> to share this damage (with a defensive), then have base <:voke:535541259465392143> back.
.
**Empowered Eruption**
⬥ Amascut says `I will not suffer this.`, `Your soul is weak` , or , `All strength withers`, or and the arena turns a certain colour, corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>). Every player will take three hits from that style. <:devo:513190158728953857> is recommended.
    • `Your soul is weak`: <:magic:689504724159823906>
    • `All strength withers`: <:melee:1096130867279171706>
    • `I will not suffer this`: <:range:580168050121113623>
.
**Empowered auto**
⬥ When Amascut does her three rapid <:melee:1096130867279171706> or <:magic:689504724159823906> auto-attacks, Amascut deals another <:magic:689504724159823906> or <:melee:1096130867279171706> hit to the tank, same tick as the third attack. This auto will always be a different style from the original three.
.
**Tank pull**
⬥ Whenever the person with aggro is too far from Amascut, she will say `You dare to turn your back on me?` and drag them before her. This stuns <:stunicon:841419289428492369> and binds <:bindicon:1102897815073603685> you for 3s. Gives adrenaline to Amascut, likely replaces an auto-attack.
⬥ Amascut's health caps at 9000k <:constitution:689509250887712902>

.
### Phase 2
**Devourer's Destruction**
Amascut says `ENOUGH! Bring forth Crondis and Apmeken` and a destruction timer of 100.2s starts. When the timer ends, every player is instakilled.
⬥ Two Gatekeeper gorilla akhs on the sides. They can stun and be stunned/bound. One random player gets marked with Apmeken's Burden <:apmekensburden:1402579857648390224>. This debuff is a ramping bleed and can be passed to others by standing next to them, resetting the damage. Modest Crocodile Demons spawn at both northern entrances, deal heavy <:range:580168050121113623> and <:magic:689504724159823906> damage, and reflect non-basic ability damage. When their adrenaline bar is full, the target's adrenaline gain is reduced by 50%. Feline Guard Akhs and Lightstealer Salawa Akhs spawn as time progresses.

.
⬥ After the Gatekeeper Gorilla Akhs are dead, players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Apmeken and Crondis. Within they will find a Chainwarden Akh and three chains.
⬥ Every killed chain turns the respective statue yellow instead of green. A player in the main arena cleanses the corrupted statue every time, permanently killing the chain. Clicking the statue early deals damage. Chains respawn over time if the statue is not cleansed within ~12s.
    • Chains can be <:soulstrikeflank:1156683164593430579> from the west/east/north especially in the eastern gateways. This is favourable for necro users.
⬥ After all three chains are broken and cleansed, the player inside the respective room can liberate the god and receive their fragment of Tumeken (30s buff timer).
    • After Crondis' blessing, two more Modest Crocodile Demons spawn.
⬥ Bringing the blessing to the right statue will stun Amascut for 25s. You cannot use <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:dive:1049378668197195808> during this, but <:prismofsalvation:892342109431029761> and <:barge:535532853916860437> do work. The stuns of both blessings stack, and after they end phase 3 starts.
⬥ Lightstealer Salawa Akhs spawn from the south in group of three. Thes can charge a blue bar and barge on players, priotizing those carrying Tumeken's light. This hits 6-7k <:melee:1096130867279171706> damage per akh.
    • These should be prioritised to kill.

**Empowered Soulfire**
⬥ During phase 2 the main arena has waves of Empowered Soulfire passing over it, south to north. Along the Chains, Empowered Soulfire will also appear. These deal magic damage. <:devo:513190158728953857> blocks damage, but duration is reduced by 3s for each hit. Each hit taken gives one <:corruption:1402610315480535050> stack.
⬥ Amascut's health caps at 7200k <:constitution:689509250887712902>

.
### Phase 3 (`Ugh... No!`)
⬥ Similar to phase 1, but includes Devourer's Shockwave with every mechanic.
⬥ Rotation:
33% adren no auto → swipes → auto → Triple Tap → 2 autos → swipes → Summon Scarabs → 3x same auto → Crushing Soul → swipes → 2 autos → Empowered Eruption → auto → swipes → auto → Triple Tap → 2 autos → swipes → phase 4.

**Devourer's Shockwave**
Amascut concentric shockwaves spread from under her outward.
⬥ The pattern is always the same:
    • First only a "middle" ring of 3 tiles wide. MD is safe, far range is safe.
    • Second are three consecutive shockwaves moving from inner to outer.
        ⬩ Inner (9x9 including under Amascut)
        ⬩ Middle (ring of 3 tiles wide)
        ⬩ Outer (ring of 6 tiles wide).
⬥ Deals typeless damage, resets defensives, and puts them on a 6s cooldown. When hit, adds 1 <:corruption:1402610315480535050> stack.
⬥ Amascut's health caps at 4800k <:constitution:689509250887712902>

.
### Phase 4
**Devourer's Destruction**
Amascut says `Scabaras...Het... Bear witness!` and the destruction timer starts again similar to phase 2.
⬥ Players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Het and Scabaras after killing the Gatekeeper gorilla akhs. No modest crocodiles spawn.

**Scarab bombs**
⬥ Explosive Scarab Akhs spawn in the arena.
    • Scarabs will not spawn on players in a 3x3 area (can use <:dive:1049378668197195808> to stop spawns).
⬥ Every non-scarab mob NPC has a carapace that makes them immune to damage. Remove the carapace by killing and grabbing Explosive Scarab Akhs, then throwing Scarabs to the NPC and through the gateways. Weaken and kill the Gatekeeper Gorilla Akhs. You need 4 Scarabs per gateway for the Chainwarden Akh and the three chains. Scarab throwing has unlimited attack range but does require line-of-sight. Alive Explosive Scarab Akhs heal Amascut over time (100 LP/Scarab/1.2s). Dead Scarabs explode over time and deal minor typeless damage to all players in the arena.
⬥ Amascut's health caps at 3000k <:constitution:689509250887712902>

.
### Phase 5 Tumeken's Reformation
**Charging the fragment of Tumeken**
⬥ Amascut says `Tumeken's heart. Delivered to me by these mortals` and four fragments shoot out of each statue, and Tumeken appears in the middle.
⬥ Two Soul Obelisks appear west and east with 30k out of 50k <:constitution:689509250887712902>, and at full health they will deal <:magic:689504724159823906> damage to all players in their half of the arena.
    • Keep their health below 50k. Soul obelisks stop healing when taking damage.
⬥ Channel statue energy to the fragments by having one or multiple players link energy from the statue to the fragment.
.
**Altar Strike**
⬥ Amascut will say `your light will be snuffed out, once and for all` strike the fragments via the altars/statues, draining them of charge.
.
**Interception**
⬥ Have a player stand on the green line to intercept Amascut's attack. All lines can be blocked simultaneously by standing in front of Amascut. Taking two hits in a row is an instakill (Interceptor debuff), so switch out with your teammates. Lightstealer Salawa Akhs will continuously spawn from the southern stairs and drain charge from the fragments of Tumeken if reached.
.
**Blinking Strike**
⬥ After a fragment is fully charged, Reform Tumeken in the centre and Amascut will become attackable again. She will start dashing and attacking the Reformed Tumeken four times saying `GET OUT OF MY WAY!``I AM.` `THE GOD.` `OF.` `DESTRUCTION`. If not intercepted by the player called by Tumeken `(name) shield us from her shadow…` the attack will instakill the party. The intercept damage has 10% <:defence:689509250979987525> penetration and can ricochets to other nearby players, sharing the damage. After the four attacks, more fragments have to be charged if progress has not reached 100.
    • The called player should stand closest to Amascut's __Southwest tile__, others should keep their distance.
⬥ For every fragment charged, reform progress increases by 1 every 1.2s. If any Lightstealer Salawa Akh explodes near Tumeken this will instakill the party.
    • Killing the Lightstealer Salawa Akhs has high priority in this phase. Can use binds <:bindicon:1102897815073603685> to prevent them from getting too close to Tumeken (within its 5x5 area).
⬥ Amascut transitions to phase 6 at 100% reform progress.
⬥ Amascut's health caps at 1800k <:constitution:689509250887712902>.
    • This cap is at 4 charged fragments, each charged fragment allowing you to deal 300k damage.

.
### Phase 6
Amascut says Amascut says `I will not be denied!` and `Mwuahahaha` and an Engulfing Shadow spawns on Tumeken.
**Engulfing Shadow**
⬥ This Shadow has 500k <:constitution:689509250887712902> and is attackable. Amascut will start charging a 500k black health bar. The Engulfing Shadow and Amascut's health bar gain 1% LP based on the Engulfed Shadow's remaining lifepoints. Engulfing Shadow Tears will appear, healing the Engulfed Shadow for 1k rapidly and 15k if not absorbed in time. After absorbing tears, a green bar fills up on the player, exploding for <:magic:689504724159823906> damage (~800 per tear?).
.
**Soul Flare**
⬥ Amascut will make it rain, with 8 3x3 projectiles landing across the arena. These deal massive typeless damage.
    • These can target players current location. For players standing on symbols to pause Collapse: do not stand on the centre tile of the symbols.
.
**Platform Collapse**
⬥ A Collapse countdown of 24s starts, when the timer runs out, the jumper is instakilled.<:instakill:1104794644497309809>. Tumeken names one player (referred to as Jumper), and that player can take the path of Tumeken to a platform on the west or east and kill the Devourer minions, moving to the next platform every time.
⬥ The Countdown can get paused temporarily by having another player stand on the same symbol as the jumper is on. This symbol will light up when stood upon. After killing all Devourers, the Jumper takes Tumeken's Light and gets the Enlightened buff <:interceptor:1402585098527965275>, and a 5x5 light area surrounds them. The Jumper reenters the arena, and the Engulfed Shadow will disappear. Amascut says `I WILL NOT BE SUBJUGATED BY A MORTAL!`.
    • Note: If the Jumper with Enlightened dies in phase 6, Amascut will start emptying her black health bar immediately! This can easily wipe the party if unprepared.

⬥ Rotation: 20% start → 2 autos → swipes → 1 auto → Player Bomb → 2 autos → swipes → 2 autos → Player Bomb → auto → swipes → 3 same autos → Empowered Eruption → swipes → 3 same autos → swipes → Soul Prison

.
**Shadows of Amascut**
⬥ Amascut says `Fall to the shadow` and Shadows of Amascut appear that need to be killed, one for each player not tanking Amascut. The Shadows deal <:magic:689504724159823906> damage when dashing towards you, otherwise attack with <:melee:1096130867279171706> , and have the Shadow Link buff <:shadowlink:1403076345084379337>. Can be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369>.
    • Green bars fill on the Shadows after the first one dies, and they respawn when full. These bars reset when another Shadow is killed.
    • A common strategy is to deathdot, <:devo:513190158728953857> (or <:reflect:535541258786177064> + <:powerburstofvitality:654618235097972737> ) with <:deflectmage:544195487926845462>, then swap to <:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> after the Shadows divebombed you. Can use <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> → <:threadsoffate:1137809172335951933> → <:bloat:1159433682403201044> → <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> → <:deathguard90:1138809243143766118> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> or (early) <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> <:deto:535533833358016512> into <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> → <:omni:535533809664262179> to clear.
.
**Player Bomb**
When Amascut says `Your companions will betray you, as they always do.`
⬥ A green bar starts on one player and gradually appears on all players with a Shadow of Amascut attacking them.
    • When the green bar on the player is full, you take a 7x7 <:defence:689509250979987525> penetration typeless hit (12k). Standing in the Tumeken's Light 5x5 area of the Jumper greatly reduces this damage.
    • Note: Blasts outside the area still hurt those inside!
    • When a second bomb happens (same voiceline), __all__ players will get the green bar at the same time.

⬥ Killing all Shadows stuns Amascut for 25s, allowing you to DPS down the black health bar. Only after depleting all the black health can her true health be reduced.
⬥ After the stun all remaining black bar health will be dealt as damage to the team in rapid succession.
⬥ Amascut's true health caps at 600k <:constitution:689509250887712902>

**Soul Prison**
*Note: This mechanic only appears 2min 40s after the `Subjugated by a mortal!` voiceline, and is rarely seen.*
Amascut will say `You will take their place, and watch as this vision becomes reality` and one player (without tumeken's light) will get imprisoned on the glyphs.
⬥ This is on the same side as was used prior in phase 6. They will be in a 3x3 of tiles that will explode. This player has to have their shackles broken by another player, and be pushed towards the one safe tile.
    • The imprisoned player can  get divebombed on by their Shadow of Amascut, as will whoever frees them, if those shadows are still alive.

.
### Phase 7
Amascut says `YOU ARE NOTHING` and teleports everyone to the throne room (27x27 tiles, or 9 "9x9" sections).
⬥ Tumeken is directly north, Apmeken's altar northwest, Scabaras' northeast, Crondis' southeast, and Het's southwest. She gains the Inner Darkness buff <:shadowlink:1403076345084379337>, meaning she will take reduced damage from all sources not blessed by the Light Within buff <:interceptor:1402585098527965275>.

*Notes: Amascut stands one tile north of centre.
⬥ Every <:magic:689504724159823906> auto-attack gives every player 1 <:corruption:1402610315480535050> stack.
⬥ Tumeken has 400k health. When he dies, everyone gets instakilled.
⬥ EZK's Flamebound Rival <:ezk:903244090953588787> <:spec:537340400273195028> and storm shards <:stormshards:536256663641128971> remain during phase transition to phase 7.
⬥ Taking a typeless Hieroglyph or Shockwave hit deals 4k <:range:580168050121113623> damage to Tumeken per player hit.
⬥ You can share the Tumeken Strike damage with players in the same quadrant*

Rotation:
Starts at 66% adrenaline → 4 <:magic:689504724159823906> autos → 4.8s charge → Tumeken Strike

.
**Tumeken Strike**
⬥ Amascut will address one of the lesser gods by name and try to strike at Tumeken.
    • Crondis: `Crondis. It should have never come to this.`
    • Scabaras: `Scabaras...`
    • Apmeken: `I am sorry Apmeken.`
    • Het: `Forgive me, Het.`
⬥ Tumeken will aid the called god's altar to bear the brunt of the strike. Provoke <:voke:535541259465392143> Amascut so she faces towards the called altar. This will let the attack on you ricochet to the altar and send Tumeken's light back at Amascut, stunning her.

.
__When done wrong__
Amascut says `Heh Heergh` or `Hmmmwuahaha`, Tumeken takes 200k damage, and the party takes massive typeless <:defence:689509250979987525> penetrating damage. 16 Engulfing Shadow Tears appear, healing Amascut 1k each every tick.
    • Fail rotation: Tumeken Strike → 3 <:magic:689504724159823906> autos → Soul Crush → 3 <:magic:689504724159823906> autos → repeat

.
__When done right__
⬥ Tumeken takes a small hit (12.5k), Amascut says `This cannot be the end...`, all players get the Light Within buff <:interceptor:1402585098527965275> for 30s and Amascut gets stunned for ~7s. After this, Amascut will use Empowered Eruptions alongside Empowered Shockwaves or Empowered Hieroglyphs. After Light Within has expired, Amascut will repeat Tumeken Strike.
⬥ An effect dependent on the god is applied.
    • Apmeken: A random player gets Apmeken's Burden debuff <:apmekensburden:1402579857648390224>
    • Scabaras: Explosive scarabs spawn. kill, grab and throw multiple to break Amascut's Carapace <:carapace:1402585081624924210>.
        ⬩ Requires 3 scarabs.
    • Crondis: Two Modest crocodile Demons (with <:modesty:1402583151322071091> ) spawn in; one southwest and one northeast.
    • Het: Amascut gains Healing in Strength <:healinginstrength:1402585055297273896>. Heals herself for ~30% of damage dealt.

**Empowered Shockwaves**
⬥ Four versions have been observed:
    • Inner area is safe (9x9)
    • Middle ring is safe, 3 tiles wide (5 tiles from Amascut)
    • Far-middle ring is safe, 3 tiles wide (8 tiles from Amascut)
    • Outer ring is safe, 3 tiles wide
.
**Empowered Hieroglyphs (after Apmeken)**
⬥ Similar to the Nakatra fight, various 9x9 sections of the arena will glow blue and blow up. She divides the arena in 9 sections, of which 3-8 sections are about to be blasted. Getting hit resets defensive cooldowns.
