## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
This is an early mechanics guide on normal mode Amascut. Beware of mistakes and expect an update in the near future.
Parts of this guide were written based on Duo NM footage. Numbers may vary based on team size!

## __Mechanics__
.tag:mechs
**Auto-attacks:**
⬥ Three rapid melee swipes on the tank.
⬥ Right hand melee attack on tank that ricochets as ranged attacks on the other players.
⬥ Left hand magic attack to all players.
After three autos, Amascut starts a new mechanic (100% adrenline).

**Mobs:**
⬥ Gatekeeper gorilla akhs (45k LP). need to be killed to use the gateways.
⬥ Feline akhs (7.5k LP). Will target those carrying a fragment of Tumeken.
⬥ Volatile scarabs (2k LP). They need to be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369> to take damage, and will explode if left alone.
⬥ Modest Crocodile (15k LP). When its bar is full, -50% adren gain. Reflects non-basic abilities.
⬥ Chainwarden mage akh (30k LP). Protects the chains beyond the gateways.
⬥ Explosive scarabs (5k LP). can be killed and then thrown to remove Carapace. expire over time.
⬥ Lightstealer salawa akh (15k LP). Will target and drain Tumeken fragment charge.

.
### Phase 1 (4000k)
⬥ 3 autos → triple tap → 3 autos → summon scarabs → 3 autos → Uppercut → 3 autos → Assault → 3 autos → triple tap → 3 autos → phase 2

**Triple Tap:**
⬥ Amascut says `Grovel`, `pathetic` OR `weak` and will launch three projectiles in the air, with each colour corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>) on the tank. These will hit the tank one tick apart. Use protection prayers <:protectfrommelee:1052551452788269127> <:protectfrommagic:1052551456835768351> <:protectfrommissiles:1052551455078367313>
.
**Uppercut:**
⬥ Amascut says `Bend the knee` OR `All strength withers` and deals big damage on the tank and has defensive penetration.
.
**Summon Scarabs:**
⬥ Amascut says `Tear them apart` and summons volatile scarabs. They need to be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369> to take damage, and will explode if left alone.

**Assault"**
⬥ Amascut says `I will not suffer this.` and the arena turns a certain colour, corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>). Every player will take three hits from that style and should use protection prayers <:protectfrommelee:1052551452788269127> <:protectfrommagic:1052551456835768351> <:protectfrommissiles:1052551455078367313>

.
### Phase 2 (2800-2850k) Apmeken and Crondis
⬥ A destruction timer of 200s starts. When the timer ends, every player is instakilled.
⬥ Kill the two gatekeeper gorilla akhs. They can stun and be stunned/bound. One player gets marked with the Burden of Amascut. this debuff is a ramping bleed and can be passed to others by standing next to them, resetting the damage. Modest crocodiles spawn at the northern entrances, deal heavy damage, and reflect non-basic ability damage. When their adrenaline bar is full, it reduces your adrenaline gain by 50%. Feline akhs spawn as time progresses.

⬥ After the gatekeeper gorillas are dead, players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Apmeken and Crondis. Within they will find a chainwarden akh (30k LP) and three chains (15k LP each).
Every killed chain turns the respective statue yellow instead of green. A player in the main arena cleanses the corrupted statue every time, permanently killing the chain. clicking the statue early deals damage. Chains respawn over time if the statue is not cleansed within ~12s. After all three chains are broken and cleansed, the player inside the respective room can liberate the god and receive their fragment of Tumeken. Bringing the blessing to the statue stuns Amascut for 25s. You cannot use <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:dive:1049378668197195808> during this, but <:prismofsalvation:892342109431029761> does work. The stuns of both blessings stack, and after they ended phase 3 starts.

.
### Phase 3
⬥ Similar to phase 1.
⬥ 3 autos → triple tap → 3 autos → summon scarabs → 3 autos → uppercut → 3 autos → Assault → 3 autos → triple tap → 3 autos → phase 4

.
### Phase 4 Het and Scarabas
⬥ Players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Het and Scarabas. No modest crocodiles spawn.
⬥ Similar to phase 2, but every non-scarab NPC has a carapace that makes them immune to damage. Remove the carapace by killing and grabbing explosive scarabs, then throwing scarabs to the NPC and through the gateways. Weaken and kill the gorillas. You need 4 scarabs per gateway for the chainwarden and the three chains. Scarab throwing has unlimited attack range. Alive scarabs heal Amascut over time (100 LP/scarab/1.2s). Exploding scarabs deal minor typeless damage to all players in the arena.

.
### Phase 5 Tumekens light
**Charging the fragment**
⬥ Amascut says `Tumekens heart. Delivered to me by these mortals` and four fragments shoot out of each statue, and Tumeken appears in the middle. Two soul obelisks appear west and east, and at full health they will deal damage to all players. Keep their health <100%. Channel statue energy to the fragments by having one or multiple players link energy from the statue to the fragment. Have another player stand on the green line to intercept the Amascut attack. Taking two hits in a row is an instakill, so switch out with your teammates. Lightstealer salawa akhs will spawn from the stairs and drain charge from the fragments of Tumeken if reached.

**Protecting Tumeken**
⬥ After a fragment is fully charged, Reform Tumeken in the centre and Amascut will become attackable again. She will start attacking the Reformed Tumeken four times saying`I AM`. `THE GOD`. `OF.` `DESTRUCTION`. If not intercepted by the player called by Tumeken `(name) shield us from her shadow…`. The attack will hit all for double(?) the damage. After the four attacks, another fragment has to be charged. Every lightstealer salawa akh that explodes on Tumeken will remove 4 reform progress.
Amascut dies at 0 health, regardless of reform progress.
