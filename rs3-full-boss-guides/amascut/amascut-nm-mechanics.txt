## __Mechanics__
.tag:mechs
**Auto-attacks:**
⬥ Left hand <:magic:689504724159823906> attack to all players.
⬥ Right hand <:melee:1096130867279171706> AoE attack on tank that ricochets as <:range:580168050121113623> attacks on the other players. <:range:580168050121113623> ricochet has a 10-tile range.
⬥ Three rapid <:melee:1096130867279171706> or <:magic:689504724159823906> swipes on the tank. The style depends on her last auto-attack: For example: if it was <:magic:689504724159823906>, the three hits will be <:magic:689504724159823906>.
    • The following autos are based on your protection or deflect prayer on the first swipe hit. If you prayed wrong against it, the following auto-attacks will be the same type as the swipe hit.
⬥ After three autos, Amascut starts a new mechanic at 100% adrenaline.

.
**Mobs:**
⬥ Gatekeeper gorilla akhs (45k LP). Need to be killed to use the gateways. <:stunicon:841419289428492369> <:bindicon:1102897815073603685>
⬥ Feline akhs (7.5k LP). Will target those carrying a fragment of Tumeken. <:stunicon:841419289428492369> <:bindicon:1102897815073603685>
⬥ Volatile scarabs (2k LP).
    • They need to be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369> to take damage, and will explode if left alone.
    • Their spawn can be prevented by standing within one tile of their burrowing spots.
⬥ Modest Crocodile (15k LP).
    • When its adrenaline bar is full, <:magic:689504724159823906> attack, removing 20% adrenaline and applying a -50% adrenaline gain debuff on the target.
    • Have Modesty buff.
⬥ Chainwarden mage akh (30k LP). Protects the chains (15k LP each) beyond the gateways.
⬥ Explosive scarabs (5k LP). Can be killed and then thrown to remove Carapace. Expire over time when killed.
⬥ Lightstealer salawa akh (15k LP). Will target and drain Tumeken's fragment charge and reform progress. <:stunicon:841419289428492369> <:bindicon:1102897815073603685>

.
### Buffs and Debuffs
**Corruption**
⬥ The tank gains one stack of Corruption for every hit received, increasing damage taken. Getting hit by Soulfire waves and Shockwaves also gives Corruption stacks. Max 15 stacks, and stacks expire ~15s after the last one has been given.
    • In phase 7 every player gets Corruption stacks from Amascut's auto-attacks.
.
**Apmeken's Burden**
⬥ Is applied by Amascut early in phase 2. Deals damage every 1.8s and adds a stack. Can be transferred to teammates. Damage increases every hit, instakilling the player at 8 stacks.
    • Amascut will apply this debuff in phase 7 when Apmeken is invoked.
.
**Modesty**
⬥ Reflects non-basic attacks such as threshold and ultimate abilities, adren-costing <:necromancy:1148995625896120460> abilities, <:spec:537340400273195028> , <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> , plus extra hits from <:bolg:994189289623662702> and <:fsoa:869284271595069451>
    • Does **not** reflect basic abilities, auto-attacks, conjure damage, <:as4:712074245202772009> , <:crack4:712073087662686249> , and <:poisonicon:944649693500154006>
.
**Healing through Strength**
⬥ Mobs can have this effect during Phase 4, where any damage they deal heals Amascut for ~30%.
    • Amascut gains this effect in phase 7 when Het is invoked.
.
**Carapace**
⬥ Multiple mobs can have this effect during Phase 4, where they are immune to damage until an explosive scarab is thrown at them.
    • Amascut gains this effect in phase 7 when Scabaras is invoked. Requires 3-5(?) Scarabs to break.
.
**Interceptor**
⬥ Gained upon blocking Amascut's Altar strike once in phase 5. Taking another strike will be an instakill <:instakill:1104794644497309809>.

.
### Phase 1 (4000k)
⬥ 3 <:magic:689504724159823906> autos → Triple Tap → swipes → 2 autos → Summon Scarabs → 1 auto → swipes → 1 auto → Crushing Soul → 2 autos → swipes → Empowered Eruption → 3 autos → Triple Tap → swipes → 2 autos → phase 2

**Triple Tap**
⬥ Amascut says `Grovel`, `pathetic` or `weak` and will launch three projectiles in the air, with each colour corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>) on the tank. These will hit the tank two ticks apart.
    • `Grovel`: <:magic:689504724159823906> → <:melee:1096130867279171706> → <:range:580168050121113623>
    • `Pathetic`: <:melee:1096130867279171706> → <:range:580168050121113623> → <:magic:689504724159823906>
    • `Weak`: <:range:580168050121113623> → <:magic:689504724159823906> → <:melee:1096130867279171706>
.
**Summon Scarabs**
⬥ Amascut says `Tear them apart` and summons Volatile Scarab Akhs. They need to be stunned <:stunicon:841419289428492369> to take damage. Will explode if left alone, dealing typeless damage.
.
**Crushing Soul**
⬥ Amascut says `Bend the knee` and deals big typeless damage on the tank. Has defensive penetration. Damage can be shared with nearby teammates (3x3?).
    • Teams can have the DPS pile <:voke:535541259465392143> to share this damage, then have base <:voke:535541259465392143> back.
.
**Empowered Eruption**
⬥ Amascut says `I will not suffer this.`, `Your soul is weak` , or , `All strength withers`, or and the arena turns a certain colour, corresponding to a combat style (green: <:range:580168050121113623>, blue: <:magic:689504724159823906>, red: <:melee:1096130867279171706>). Every player will take three hits from that style.
    • `Your soul is weak`: <:magic:689504724159823906>
    • `All strength withers`: <:melee:1096130867279171706>
    • `I will not suffer this`: <:range:580168050121113623>
.
**Empowered auto**
⬥ When Amascut does her three rapid <:melee:1096130867279171706> or <:magic:689504724159823906> auto-attacks, Amascut deals another <:magic:689504724159823906> or <:melee:1096130867279171706> hit to the tank, same tick as the third attack. This auto will always be a different style from the original three.
.
**Tank pull**
⬥ Whenever the person with aggro is too far from Amascut, she will say `You dare to turn your back on me?` and drag them before her. This stuns <:stunicon:841419289428492369> and binds <:bindicon:1102897815073603685> you for 3s. Gives adrenaline to Amascut, likely replaces an auto-attack.

.
### Phase 2 (2800k) Apmeken and Crondis
⬥ A destruction timer of 200s starts. When the timer ends, every player is instakilled.
⬥ Kill the two gatekeeper gorilla akhs. They can stun and be stunned/bound. One player gets marked with the Burden of Amascut. this debuff is a ramping bleed and can be passed to others by standing next to them, resetting the damage. Modest crocodiles spawn at the northern entrances, deal heavy damage, and reflect non-basic ability damage. When their adrenaline bar is full, it reduces your adrenaline gain by 50%. Feline akhs spawn as time progresses.

.
⬥ After the Gatekeeper Gorilla Akhs are dead, players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Apmeken and Crondis. Within they will find a chainwarden akh (30k LP) and three chains (15k LP each).
Every killed chain turns the respective statue yellow instead of green. A player in the main arena cleanses the corrupted statue every time, permanently killing the chain. clicking the statue early deals damage. Chains respawn over time if the statue is not cleansed within ~12s. After all three chains are broken and cleansed, the player inside the respective room can liberate the god and receive their fragment of Tumeken (30s buff timer).
    • After Crondis' blessing, two more Modest Crocodile Demons spawn.
⬥ Bringing the blessing to the right statue will stun Amascut for 25s. You cannot use <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:dive:1049378668197195808> during this, but <:prismofsalvation:892342109431029761> and <:barge:535532853916860437> do work. The stuns of both blessings stack, and after they end phase 3 starts.

.
### Phase 3 (2000k)
⬥ Similar to phase 1
⬥ Rotation:
    • 33% adren no auto → swipes → auto → Triple Tap → 2 autos → swipes → Summon Scarabs → 3 same autos → Triple Tap → swipes → 2 autos → Empowered Eruption → auto → swipes → auto → Triple Tap → 2 autos → swipes → phase 4.

.
### Phase 4 (1200k)
⬥ Players can go into gateways west and east to free the Echoes of Het and Scabaras. No modest crocodiles spawn.
⬥ Similar to phase 2, but every non-scarab NPC has a carapace that makes them immune to damage. Remove the carapace by killing and grabbing explosive scarabs, then throwing scarabs to the NPC and through the gateways. Weaken and kill the gorillas. You need 4 scarabs per gateway for the chainwarden and the three chains. Scarab throwing has unlimited attack range. Alive scarabs heal Amascut over time (100 LP/scarab/1.2s). Exploding scarabs deal minor typeless damage to all players in the arena.

.
### Phase 5 (600k)
**Charging the fragment**
⬥ Amascut says `Tumekens heart. Delivered to me by these mortals` and four fragments shoot out of each statue, and Tumeken appears in the middle. Two soul obelisks appear west and east, and at full health they will deal damage to all players. Keep their health <100%. Channel statue energy to the fragments by having one or multiple players link energy from the statue to the fragment. Have another player stand on the green line to intercept the Amascut attack. Taking two hits in a row is an instakill, so switch out with your teammates. Lightstealer salawa akhs will spawn from the stairs and drain charge from the fragments of Tumeken if reached.

**Protecting Tumeken**
⬥ After a fragment is fully charged, Reform Tumeken in the centre and Amascut will become attackable again. She will start attacking the Reformed Tumeken four times saying`I AM`. `THE GOD`. `OF.` `DESTRUCTION`. If not intercepted by the player called by Tumeken `(name) shield us from her shadow…`. The attack will hit all for double(?) the damage. After the four attacks, another fragment has to be charged. Every lightstealer salawa akh that explodes on Tumeken will remove 4 reform progress.
Amascut dies at 0 health, regardless of reform progress.
