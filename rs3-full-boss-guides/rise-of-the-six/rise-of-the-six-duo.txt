> __**Introduction**__
This guide assumes you understand the basics of combat, equipment, and the RotS fight, including mechanics. If you’d like to know more about mechanics it is recommend to read <#1040075273099559033> or watch: <https://youtu.be/lN5vy1gEh4o> (**Important note:** Use this video **SOLELY** for explanation of mechanics. The methods are very outdated.).

RotS is generally done in a team size of 4 and the fight takes place in a split arena where the team is split into pairs. Each side will have 3 brothers, the order of which changes everyday. However you will spend more time running through tunnels than you will actually fighting the brothers, which is why it is important to be proficient at both dps rotations and movement.

<:persistentrage:739965637056659567> is a very crucial part of RotS, this relic allows you to start every kill at full adrenaline without <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and <:dummy:656844963522281473>

At RotS the meta is to AoE the brothers down as fast as possible. Most of the meta and strategy revolve around stacking and luring the brothers so that they can be killed at the same time.

With the rotations provided the kills that are lurable should all be either 6.6 seconds or lower.

Each RoTS kill is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!B186$.

⬥ Double <:surge:535533810004262912> and <:bd:535532854281764884> / <:dive:1049378668197195808> unlocked is crucial for high kph. They are important in exiting tunnels efficiently.
    • Equipment with the <:mob:689501908628799488> should also be used for this purpose.

⬥ Equipment with <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> for a flat 7% and 15% (for 10 seconds) respectively.
    • Both the perk and sigil work against the brothers.
    • Take note that <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and <:ghosthunterhelm:855865893808767016> do now work against the brothers.
    • You can now get an Undead slayer task and <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> will work against the brothers.

                                                                                                                  .
