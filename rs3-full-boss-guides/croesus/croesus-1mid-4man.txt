*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the mechanics and the general concept of Croesus. If not, please read <#892084479953358869>.

1mid is faster than standard 2 mid 4-mans and duo due to only doing the first energy fungus and not waiting for the second energy fungus. However, it does require alt accounts.

⬥ If done properly, all kills should be sub-4.

**__Tips__**
.tag:tips
⬥ <:huntercape:1014248192386273310> needs to be keybound, press the keybind every 2-ticks (1.2s) in order to utilise it.
⬥ Avoid clicking potions and rotting fungus from your inventory as this will stop you from gathering.
    • Keybinding them prevents this.
⬥ Only gather from the sparkling nodes to deplete faster.
⬥ Try to maximise the time you're gathering, the only specs you should move for are smokes and fairy ring.
⬥ Use movement abilities <:bdmobile:867678153668820992> <:surgemobile:867678153798975498> <:escapemobile:867678153769877514> to traverse between nodes.
    • More details in role specific section below.
⬥ Spam clicking the <:fishing:892342109938540564> & <:woodcutting:1014248186782699541> nodes will make you gather one tick faster per resource.
⬥ Using Walk Markers is extremely helpful so you know when you get to the tile you have clicked.
⬥ Use <:escapemobile:867678153769877514> → <:bdmobile:867678153668820992> back to node to dodge bombs.

**__Strategy Information__**
.tag:strat
Alting is used to scale the boss fight to get more points through the Energy Fungus (mid) and the Core so you don't have to wait for the second energy fungus.

.
There are 2 strategies, it is recommended for you to use alts to benefit the quality and speed of kills. In both strats you can use the alts to gather 15 resources and deposit them into the resource box which makes you gather 5 less resources.

⬥ 4 alts
    • Each player brings an alt.
        ⬩ These don't need any stats, they can be complete fresh accounts but you can also use alts with stats to benefit the kill.
        ⬩ If you're not using them to benefit the kill run them through the mushroom field immediately upon kill start so you don't gain any enrage through them tanking mechanics.

⬥ 6 alts
⬥ Two people double alt, the other two single alt.
    • Players ideally want their alt to have 80 in the skill they're doing and at least 50 Construction.
    • 2 alts can also help on the core with this method. Base 80+ on the 4 gathering skills is optimal.

.
**Your goal is to deplete your node, get to your statue and start repairing before the first mid. On the 6 alt teams you can use your alts to help repair statues (2 to 1 statue, no more). If done correctly you should all have depleted your nodes and fully repaired the statues before the first mid spawns.**

**__Strategy Execution__**
⬥ Gather 10 resources and rot it then gather another 15 resources with depletion then poison your node (25 in total before running).
    • If you're not using an alt to gather 15 resources and deposit into the resource box, don't rot 10, gather 5 more and deposit it (30 in total before running).

⬥ Running should be done efficiently utilisling both <:surge:535533810004262912> and <:bd:535532854281764884>
    • Go **2 quadrants anticlockwise** and deposit your resources in the statue.
    • Take the resources from the resource box and go **1 quadrant anticlockwise**.
    • Deposit the resources in the statue and start repairing the statue.

⬥ Statues repairing should be done using minimal time to dodge attacks.
    • <:surge:535533810004262912> through the statue at 2:23 for the energy fungus.
    • Once it's done pray on your statue, if someone hasn't finished repairing go help them after praying.
    • Drink the relevant soup and attack the core. If it's Hunter drink an Extreme Hunter dose too.
        ⬩ You can 2-tick Hunter cores.

⬥ Click all the particles that are not red, even on Hunter if 2-ticking you just have to spam click it (the damage may not show up).
