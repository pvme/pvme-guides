## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
The [Queen Black Dragon](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Queen_Black_Dragon>) resides in the lowest level of the Grotworm Lair which can be found just west of Port Sarim. 60 <:Summoning:583430259064569856> is required to be able to enter the arena via the Summoning portal. Before attempting the fight it is _highly_ recommended to have at least level 80 in your preferred combat style (generally <:range:580168050121113623> or <:Magic:689504724159823906>) and access to super antifire potions.

*Note: Completion of the [Song from the Depths](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Song_from_the_Depths>) quest is recommended as well to reduce the amount of damage received.*
