## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
This is a mechanics guide for 4-man Nex: Angel of Death. It is assumed that you know how to deal with mechanics in 7-man AoD, described in <#1020818825840689262>.

Due to the meta heavily favouring ranged at the time of writing, this guide will assume that the team consists of **Ranged Minion Tanks**. The base can either Necro or Range.

The current rotations can **consistently reaver skip** if executed correctly.

.
## __Mechanics__
.tag:mechanics
Dealing with mechanics in 4-man AoD is slightly different to how they are dealt with in 7-mans. The following summarizes the major mechanics of the fight and how to deal with them.
### Phase 1 (3,000,000 - 2,100,000 HP)
⬥ Elements
    • Quadrant with elements:
        ⬩ Tank it as you would in larger teams.
    • Quadrant with reavers:
        ⬩ Throw sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> at the reavers until AoD hits her phase hp.
        ⬩ Sticky bombs last 6s / 10t.
        ⬩ Before getting bound by consecutive sticky bombs, the reaver will always walk at least 1 tile.

*Note: Fast teams should not need to tank elements and do not require sticky bombs as you should consistently reaver skip.*

.
### Phase 2 (2,100,000 - 1,800,000 HP)
Handle mechanics exactly the same as in Phase 1.

.
### Phase 3 (1,800,000 - 600,000 HP)
⬥ Smoke Pool
    • All tanked pools taken deal 14k damage spread evenly among the people inside.
    • Base is to tank the first pool making use of a vitality potion <:vitality:654618235097972737>. If the base is using range, the Fumus Minion Tank may instead handle the first pool with a vitality potion <:vitality:654618235097972737>.
    • If there are any other pools, they have to be tanked by at least 2 people both with >7k hp.
⬥ Ice
    • Assist the team member who is trapped ice by doing damage on the ice to free them.
⬥ All other mechanics work the same as in 7s.

## __Dummy Placement__
.tag:dummy
.
⬥ Important Notes
    • Dummies <:dummy:656844963522281473> **CANNOT** be placed during Nex's *elements* special attack since squares are blocked for placement
    • Familiars <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> block dummies, they are 2x2
    • Conjures <:conjurearmy:1166094935066423348> block dummies, they are 1x1
    • Prisms <:prismofrestoration:938475261366784070> <:prismofloyalty:1016651066684756070> block dummies
    • Make sure before placing a dummy that nothing blocks it
        ⬩ Call your familiars
        ⬩ Move your conjures (Target the Glacies Amalgamation)
        ⬩ Don't place prisms near where dummies are supposed to be placed

## __Minion Lure__
.tag:lure
To lure the minions using 3 minion tanks (UG Tank, C Tank and F Tank) players need to do the movement correctly.
⬥ UG Tank will do the following:
    • <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> at the Fumus detonation spot and move to the center line to avoid elements
    • Move behind the umbra amalgamation (1) while targeting the amalgamation
    • Pre vuln umbra, and surge north after umbra spawns (to 2).
    • Vuln glacies, and surge through nex to lure (to 3).
    • After luring, you may move to the center line to be closer to first pillar (4).
⬥ C Tank will do the following:
    • <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> at the Umbra detonation spot and move to the center line to avoid elements
    • Surge the minion through nex as you would in a 7-man team at the timing listed in rotations
⬥ F Tank will do the following:
    • <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> at the Umbra detonation spot and move to the center line to avoid elements
    • Surge the minion through nex as you would in a 7-man team at the timing listed in rotations
    • Move back into after minion is fully lured
