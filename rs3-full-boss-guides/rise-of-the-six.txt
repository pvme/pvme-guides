__**Introduction**__
This guide assumes a strong understanding of everything within <#1040075273099559033>.

Each RoTS kill is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!B186$. Advanced players can get up to $data_pvme:Bosses!B189$ kph, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C189$ gp/hr.

.tag:presets
Bladed dive is critical to being able to exit tunnels efficiently and increase KPH. One important thing for RotS is to use the Undead Slayer perk, as it will increase your DPS by a flat 7%. Undead Slayer ability, if owned and activated, will also increase your damage against the brothers by 15% for 10 seconds. Trips are generally ~30 minutes long, it is rare to eat during kills and the majority of your food will be used while in tunnels. This negates the downsides of using sara brews + solids i.e. stat drain will be nullified by the time you are back at pads and since you are out of combat you won't lose adrenaline from solids.

__**Beginner Preset**__
The amount of food can be adjusted once you get familiar with the boss. Using either an adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic is highly recommended to stall adrenaline between kills. At the higher ends an adrenaline urn will start falling off generally around ~40+ kills per hour.

> __**Positioning**__
.tag:position
The brothers starting positions change everyday, hence your starting position will also change. On each side, three brothers spawn on three seperate squares, spawning alphabetically going from North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil.

.
Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it’s ADG, you would only move from the starting spot if:
(1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner
(2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side
(3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage.

Only move when you see one of these things happening:

.
**__Dharok__**
The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin.

.
**__Guthan__**
Guthan can melee spin. Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don’t want the Incite to move at all).

.
**__Torag__**
The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin.

.
**__Verac__**
Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move.

.
**__Ahrim__**
Ahrim’s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won’t take damage.

.
**__Karil__**
Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move. His **firespin attack** is the same as Ahrim’s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His **bomb attack** can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. If you are low on food or it’s shadow realm, you need to move quickly.

**__Notes__**
⬥ If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks.
⬥ Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk any frag shots. They will need to walk under Ahrim in order to walk all three brothers’ frag shots. For example, if it’s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting.
⬥ Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target. That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side.

.
**__Ahrim + 2 Melee__**
Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> / <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:needle:535541259108876293> / <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise

Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks. Relure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275>

**__Karil + 2 Melee__**
You will be skipping auto in order to burst down karil asap to avoid specs. However this will also mean that sometimes Karil might not be the first to die in which case the DPS has the option to replace snipe with greater ricochet.
<:mechchin:641669268722810881> → (tc) + <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe/needle hits) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:gricocaroming:867678153966878740> → Improvise

.
When K is mid, the incite for this side will start the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where Karil spawns to make sure none of the brothers end up behind you. If Karil specs, start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks and relure them ASAP onto Karil when he is attackable. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=154>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=290>

If K is south, the DPS stands 1 square south of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square south of where the middle brother spaws. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=174>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=308>

If K is north, the DPS stands 1 square north of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square north of where the middle brother spawns. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=193>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=326>

.
**__Triple Melee__**
Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> / <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise

.
The 3M incite always starts the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where middle brother spawns. In order to prevent aggro onto the DPSer, It is recommended that the incite wait until after his first bleed (Corruption Shot) to start running. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=249>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=390>

**__AK (Middle)__**
West (Surge rotation): (<:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:gricocaroming:867678153966878740> + <:surge:535533810004262912> (During GCD) → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise
East (Door rotation): (<:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:gricocaroming:867678153966878740> + (Side step) → (tc) + <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise

With Karil as the middle brother it is possible to use the surge rotation on both west side. This implies that you stand on the 2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins dbow > improvise. If you do not have a 9 tile range weapon you can do the intial auto + ability on the melee brother. If you are on the east side you will use the door method with a side step. This implies that you will start on the eastern tile and walk one tile west after auto + ability. Examples can be seen here:
East: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=231>
West: <https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=342>

.
**__AK (South)__**
Start on the east tile infront of the door, after your Auto + bleed, walk one tile west.
(East): Auto + <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> / <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise

If you are west there is no effcient way to DD the brothers. The current meta is to DD north of Ahrim and finish Karil with high burst damage, then continue on with the kill as normal.
(West): Target Karil → Auto + <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Switch targets once Karil is dead and improvise

Examples can be seen here: (Note the example for east rotation does not side step, however it is still recommended to do so)

> **__Miscellaneous Tips and Tricks__**
.tag:misc
**__Kill Priorities__**
Generally, the kill priority order goes Karil → Torag → Dharok → Guthan → Ahrim = Verac.
With everyone chinning, the kill order is not as important as it used to be. If there is ever an opportunity to chin brothers, do so (and when chinning you cannot control, really, which brother takes the most damage). However, if brothers are not stacked for some reason (e.g running from a spec), then this order becomes important.

Karil is the highest priority target because his specs are the most dangerous and most damaging. Torag is next because his hammer spec has a lot of KO potential if it ever occurs simultaneously with any other spec (spin, bomb, lightning, etc). Dharok is next because he hits hard when low HP and can prolong a kill if he does a Give Me Everything special. Guthan is slightly less annoying than Dharok. Ahrim and Verac do very little damage and have mundane specials, so they are last.

.
**__How to Keep Track of Karil__**
Karil is relatively dangerous, and it is possible to die because you didn’t see Karil leaving a bomb in the pile. The most consistent way to know where Karil is speccing is to watch for changes in the soul split animation. When Karil flies away to do a spec, the cloud-like animations that travel between the player and target will often track with him. By watching the clouds, you can know if and where Karil is speccing. If they suddenly fly towards somewhere on your side, he’s probably doing a firespin. If they fly towards one of the pillars on the chasm, it’s probably a lightning attack (might still be a bomb!). If they fly somewhere to the other side, you know it’s a bomb. This tip is useful for people on and opposite of Karil’s side.

.
**__Conserving Food__**
⬥ Most importantly, learn to avoid special attacks and kill the brothers quickly.
⬥ Perfect your surges and bladed dives in the tunnels
⬥ Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: <https://youtu.be/7OhoZcO2gXY>).
⬥ Activate fortitude when you activate Excalibur. You’ll heal about 30 more lp per Excalibur heal, and those extra lp will stick around after you deactivate fortitude.

__**Introduction to Duo**__
This guide assumes you have a good knowledge of the boss fight already.

This method aims to kill Karil consistently before he does a special attack whilst also doing good damage to all brothers for fast kill times. With good tunneling, you can get 40+ kills per hour.

For this method to work, you must swap sides every kill so Karil side always has <:enhreplen:634350450887622656> / <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> up.
Upon exiting the tunnel, the first person out will drop a <:dummy:656844963522281473> and build on it (alternatively have an alt outside with a dummy).
Non Karil side will <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> <:gricocaroming:867678153966878740> then make an instance whilst building with defensives (<:prep:535541258546970624> <:res:535541258844635148> <:anti:535541306475151390> <:freedom:535541258240786434>) whilst going to the pad.
Karil side will build to at least 78% before entering then building with defensives (<:prep:535541258546970624> <:res:535541258844635148> <:anti:535541306475151390> <:freedom:535541258240786434>) whilst going to the pad.

**__Karil Middle 2 Melee Rotaton__**
.
For this method, you will not need <:bolg:994189289623662702> but it does help for last brother cleanup.
You can use <:enhreplen:634350450887622656> or <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> for this rotation to work,, but you have to be tick perfect with <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> otherwise you will be off tick and Karil can do a special attack. The non-Karil side will specifically not kill any brothers until the Karil side is entirely dead so they don't get healed. This is because the Karil side has a lack of adrenaline after their rotation which gives them a lack of good abilities to cleanup.

**__AK Melee South (Surge) Rotation__**
