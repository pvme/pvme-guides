*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

The Temple of Aminishi, is the first Elite Dungeon, a 1-3 player combat/narrative experience that rewards unique loot, such as Ancient Scales <:ancientscale:643162215137935360> to make the Elite Sirenic <:elitesirenicbody:643846908305211413> armour, aswell as Dungeoneering experience and tokens <:dungtoken:762960358930907156>.

The Temple of Aminishi is located on the island of Aminishi and requires completion of Impressing the Locals to access, additionally, the grouping system is required in order to form a team of 2-3 players.

**__General Notes__**
⬥ The rotations listed for the bosses are for an advanced setup, lower tiered set-ups will require improvisation.
⬥ It's recommended to set your anti-spam delay for your Double Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to 1 via the Lectern at Anachronia.
⬥ You can Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> a tick before each gate unlocks to save a tick on every entry.
⬥ <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** will **not** improve the number of scales dropped.

The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared.

Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand south of the boss, otherwise Arhats/Anagami will aggro you and AoEs will not work (<:cleave:535532878616985610>, <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

**Phase 1 Notes**
⬥ <:ds:535541258924326912> further away from head (East / West) so you can dodge Seiryu's tendril attack without leaving Flank <:flank4:712073088296157185> range.
⬥ Lower HP to ~5k before Shadow Tendrils, only heal up to ~3k before each mage hit after Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, camp mage prayer after <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> to lower your HP even more (~1.5k).
    • This is so that you can benefit from the Berserker's Fury <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> relic power.
⬥ Make sure to end on 90%+ adren so that you don't have to rely on <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> procs.

**__1 Cycle Notes__**
⬥ Never Soul Split unless under <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> to keep HP as low as possible.
⬥ Use <:limitless:641339233638023179> to get to thresholds if low adrenaline.
⬥ Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> for all Dark Bow specs <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
⬥ If you are not using Heightened Senses <:heightenedsenses:697808773573771344>, it is important to time your <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> during <:rapid:535541270521708566> properly for the 3rd Crystal, if it's late then you won't get enough adrenaline in time and if it's too early you will overboost.
    • Ideally use it on the 6th tick of Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>.
