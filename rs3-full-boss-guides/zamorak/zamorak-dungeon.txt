### Introduction
.tag:intro
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

Zamorak, Lord of Chaos is the fifth and final installment in the Elder God Wars. This guide will primarily focus on clearing the dungeon segment, for help defeating the boss visit <#1251104943566491710>.

.
## __General Notes for Senntisten Undercity + Zamorak__
.tag:miscinformation
⬥ Lucky charms for the dungeon can be bought from Thoksdottir at Daemonheim
⬥ A **LOT** of mobs can be ignored throughout the dungeon, but note that **Menders and Dark Wizards will heal mobs/drain your adrenaline**
⬥ The only required minibosses are the Jailer on the second floor (who teleports to different floors after 50k damage dealt x Team Size) and Eterna being the second boss before Zamorak.
⬥ A Demon / Greater Demon slayer task will affect a great number of mobs present in the dungeon.
    • Kuradal offers the best chance for this task.
