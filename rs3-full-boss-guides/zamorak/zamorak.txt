## __Fight Overview__
.tag:overview
.
Zamorak has 6 phases that are progressed by depleting his health bar and charging the 6 edicts, or pads, located around the arena. During each phase he will cycle through 3 health bar colours, each with their own effects that dictate the progression of the fight:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/XvTHsFcxSC.png
⬥ **Grey HP:** The health bar Zamorak starts with and regains between each phase
    • Zamorak will have accelerated 4-tick attack speed and deal 50% more damage, but **won't use special attacks**
    • Cannot be fully depleted through damage and will constantly regenerate itself at an increasing rate
        ⬩ Healing is prevented on ticks that Zamorak takes damage, meaning DoT and multihit abilities can be used to stall the healing somewhat
        ⬩ At 900% enrage, regeneration increase will start **carrying over between grey HP phases**, meaning healing will keep scaling to become drastically higher in later phases
    • Upon activating a pad, all remaining **grey HP** will be converted into **red HP**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/TZEQHE85wb.png
⬥ **Red HP:** The health bar Zamorak gains upon the player activating a pad
    • Zamorak will have accelerated 4-tick attack speed and deal 50% more damage, and **will do his next special attack every 10 auto attacks**
        ⬩ The **first mechanic in red HP** will carry over attacks from the previous **green HP** phase, see the __**Special Attack Order**__ section for more information
    • Must be depleted by dealing damage and will be followed by **green HP**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/GRgpCe9WAg.png
⬥ **Green HP:** Zamorak's **main health bar**, and is split into 6 sections representing each phase
    • Zamorak will have 5-tick attack rate and deal normal damage, and **will do his next special attack every 5 auto attacks**
        ⬩ The **first mechanic in green HP** on each phase will happen after **1 auto attack**
    • Upon depletion of each section, Zamorak will **regain Grey HP and start the *Channelers* mechanic**

.
Overall, the progression of the first 6 phases can be summarised as:

**Grey HP > charge pad > deplete red HP > deplete green HP section > *Channelers* + grey HP > repeat**

⬥ Zamorak's **green HP** scales between 300,000 and 1,600,000 <:constitution:689509250887712902> per player, capping at 1740% enrage
    • Phases 1-5 each take up 16% of the total **green HP** bar, while phase 6 takes up 20%
⬥ At 100%+ enrage, Zamorak will gain an additional 7th phase that will be explained in its own section

.
## __Special Attacks__
.tag:specs
⬥ **Channelers**
    • Automatically triggered upon phasing Zamorak from **green HP** into **grey HP**
    • A message will appear saying **`Zamorak begins to draw power and energy from something within Infernus.`** , this will spawn a Chaos Witch Channeler in Infernus
    • Players must enter Infernus with the extra action button <:realmmovement:1073955377537876089> and defeat the witch before being able to charge the next pad
    • The witch has 33,000 health <:constitution:689509250887712902> + 132 <:constitution:689509250887712902> for every 10 enrage increase
    • It is advised to <:anti:535541306475151390> / <:freedom:535541258240786434> before <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the witch since it is able to stun
    • At 500%, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 50% adrenaline and their first ability is <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • At 1000%+, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is <:omni:535533809664262179>

.
⬥ **Flames of Zamorak**
    • Zamorak will yell **`This world will burn.`** and slam into the ground, dealing 2 melee hits and spawning a line of black smoke between himself and a "random" player
    • Picking up the smoke by walking over it will start a timer over the player that deals typeless damage at the end
        ⬩ The damage increases and gains additional **defence piercing** the more stacks that are picked up
        ⬩ If the smoke is left on the ground, Zamorak will gain stacks reducing his damage taken
    • To deal with this, be close to the boss, <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>, use defensives <:disrupt:535614336207552523> <:devo:513190158728953857> if low HP, and use <:res:535541258844635148> / <:divert:787904334377648130> on the timed damage
    • Entering Infernus with the timer running will detonate the damage immediately with **increased defence piercing**
    • Although the smoke spawn is supposed to be random, players standing on the northeast side of Zamorak are higher priority to be targeted for the smoke

[Flames of Zamorak example](https://youtu.be/2YZ5tD-7_1g) using <:disrupt:535614336207552523> + <:divert:787904334377648130>

.
⬥ **Adrenaline Cage**
    • Zamorak will say **`Chaos, unfettered!`** then temporarily drops overhead prayers and spawns a cage on the bases' location to bombard with 5 magic attacks
    • If no player is standing on the cage location, all players will take heavy typeless damage, have their adrenaline drained, and suffer a heavy adrenaline gain debuff
    • Remain still, <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> and use <:devo:513190158728953857> / <:reflect:535541258786177064> + <:vitality:654618235097972737>
    • At 1500%+ the player taking the hits will have <:devo:513190158728953857> disabled
        ⬩ <:devo:513190158728953857> + <:cept:543478434509357098> from another player will still work

⬥ **Chaos Blast**
    • Zamorak will curl up and begin charging his attack shouting **`I will tear you asunder!`**
    • During this time Zamorak may be stunned enough (equal to team size) and will require a damage check right after, which will then force him to release the attack
        ⬩ If Zamorak is not stunned the attack will be released after 18 seconds
    • He will yell **`Feel the rage of a god.`** and send a red projectile that deals damage based on how long he was allowed to charge
        ⬩ The attack has a base **defence piercing** of 40%
    • Use a combination of defensives <:vitality:654618235097972737> / <:res:535541258844635148> / <:disrupt:535614336207552523> / <:reflect:535541258786177064>, at higher enrages you may opt to simply not stun and <:immort:535541258538582017> instead

.
.tag:infernaltombtimingclip
⬥ **Infernal Tomb**
    • Zamorak says `Step into the dark... meet your death.`, assigns a rune over each players' head, and transports them to Infernus where chaos demons (amount equal to team size) are marching towards a portal to the main arena
        ⬩ Each Chaos Demon has 15,000 - 70,000 health <:constitution:689509250887712902>, capping at 1470% enrage
        ⬩ Use abilities such as <:ent:567727987274022924> / <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> to keep the demon(s) in place and kill them
    • Players must go to the same corresponding rune they received overhead to exit Infernus
        ⬩ Going to the wrong rune will deal heavy damage to all players
    • As players are sent into Infernus at the beginning of the mechanic, Zamorak will start charging his *Chaos Blast* mechanic, with only the stun portion required to force him to release the attack
        ⬩ It is highly suggested to pre-stun Zamorak to keep this damage manageable without <:immort:535541258538582017>
        ⬩ [Example clip of proper stun timing here.](https://img.pvme.io/images/URj54bk2bF.mp4)

.
⬥ **Rune of Destruction**
    • Zamorak will say `You're already dead.` and lay a massive red rune around him with a disc-shaped gap
    • Black sludge will spawn SSW (South South-West) of the rune and rotate clockwise or counterclockwise sometimes changing direction and stuns those who get hit by it twice
    • The red areas deal constant typeless damage to those standing in it
    • The player cannot teleport to Infernus <:realmmovement:1073955377537876089> for the duration of the attack

.
    • The rune can be divided in 12 pineapple pizza slices as showed in the diagram, the black sludge occupies 2 and always moves in steps of 1 slice
        ⬩ The black sludge will either spawn in 12-11 moving clockwise or in 1-2 moving counterclockwise
        ⬩ The black sludge will move around the ring, changing position every 2 ticks, 18 times
        ⬩ The black sludge can randomly change the direction it is moving towards up to 2 times
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/m1UJDNgR4E.png

.
    • Using the image below, you can position yourself in optimal spots depending on the spawn point of the black sludge
        ⬩ This will buy more time to react to the sludges' movement, allowing you to stay in your damage-boosting ultimates
        ⬩ If you are unsure, starting SSW, or between 12 and 1 in the diagram, will assure that you won't be hit twice and stunned on the first rotation
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/vxsy6VH1YY.png
.
### Special Attack Order
.
.tag:specorder
.
The following diagram outlines the pattern of special attacks used by <:zamorak:994914159969976440> and how they vary based on when you transition between phases:
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/yK52L3k.png
.
⬥ The special attack order updates to a new phase when **red HP** is depleted. Special attacks that occur during **red HP** will still use the previous attack order from **green HP**
⬥ Zamorak's first special attack in **red HP will carry over auto attacks from the previous green HP** phase
    • *E.g. if Zamorak uses Adrenaline Cage in phase 3 followed by 2 autoattacks before phasing into **grey HP**, after the next pad is charged Zamorak will use 3 autoattacks followed by Chaos Blast, then resume using special attacks in 10-autoattack intervals*
    • Phase 1 **red HP** doesn't have a previous **green HP** so the first special attack will simply happen after 10 autoattacks
⬥ Zamorak's first special attack in **green HP** will always happen after 1 autoattack before he resumes using special attacks in 5-autoattack intervals

.
## __Hexes and Edicts__
.tag:pads
⬥ **Charge Pads**
    • The arena has 6 pads that you can stand on to charge.
    • When it is fully charged, Zamorak will stop attacking for a while and your adrenaline bar will be refilled. After this, you will gain an **Edict** while Zamorak gains a **Hex** depending on the pad charged.
    • You will become unable to charge pads during the *Channelers* mechanic. To continue charging the next pad, you must enter Infernus <:realmmovement:1073955377537876089> and kill the witch present.

.
⬥ **Hexes and Edicts**
    • Every time a pad is charged, all players and Zamorak will gain a stack of currently active stacking edicts and hexes, respectively
    • This makes it such that earlier pad effects become stronger as the fight progresses
        ⬩ Note that pads 3 and 5 don't have stacking effects
        ⬩ *E.g. if you activate pads 2 → 4 → 1 → 3 → 6 → 5, once 5 is activated rune 2 will have 6 stacks, rune 4 will have 5 stacks, rune 1 will have 4 stacks, and rune 6 will have 2 stacks*
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/pAOYodBn8H.png
    • **During phase 7, all stacking edicts and hexes have their stack amounts reversed**
        ⬩ *E.g. Using the pad order in the above example, phase 7 will act as if the pad order were 5 → 6 → 3 → 1 → 4 → 2*
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/tOouJ4IzhG.png
⬥ A calculator has been made to gauge the effects of each activated Edict & Hex: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Combat/Rune_pads>

## __Hex: Twinshot__
.tag:twinshot
.
Twinshot <:twinshotrune:994206062498549780> from pad 1 and Disintegrate <:disintegraterune:994206018680668171> from pad 4 will result in the largest increases in incoming damage, especially when they are ramped up in later phases

⬥ **Twinshot** <:twinshotrune:994206062498549780> deals a **second hit 1 tick after all of Zamorak's autoattacks**, equal to 10% of the possible max hit per stack, which allows for less <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> uptime and creates special hit timings to be wary of once it's active
    • During **grey HP** and **red HP**, Zamorak will have an accelerated 4-tick attack rate, meaning <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> <:deflectrange:544195488317046812> will have to be active 1/2 of the time with twinshot <:twinshotrune:994206062498549780> active
    • During the *Flames of Zamorak* mechanic, if the black smoke is picked up immediately, the timed damage will occur on the **same tick as a twinshot hit during grey HP and red HP**
        ⬩ This will make it impossible to <:res:535541258844635148> / <:divert:787904334377648130> the timed damage unless <:devo:513190158728953857> is also used
        ⬩ Note that entering Infernus <:realmmovement:1073955377537876089> or phasing Zamorak between **red HP**/**grey HP** and **green HP**, causing his attack speed to change, while the timer is running can cause the damage to line up with an attack regardless of twinshot being active or not

.
## __Hex: Disintegrate__
.tag:disintegrate
⬥ **Disintegrate** <:disintegraterune:994206018680668171> from pad 4 grants Zamorak **7% defence piercing per stack on his attacks**, stacking with existing defence piercing values such as *Chaos Blast*: 40% and *Flames of Zamorak* Smoke damage: 1% per stack
    • This only affects the following defensives:
        ⬩ Disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>
        ⬩ Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689>
        ⬩ Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>
        ⬩ Divert <:divert:787904334377648130>
        ⬩ Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>
        ⬩ Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729>
        ⬩ Shield dome <:shielddome:537341954392850442>
    • The % damage taken through a defensive affected by disintegrate is calculated as follows
        ⬩ `= floor(Defensive_value * (Disintegrate_stacks * 0.07 + Base_piercing) + (100 - Defensive_value))/100`
    • Given the way some defensives are calculated through this effect, this results in a buff and debuff on certain aspects of them:
        ⬩ Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> damage **increases** as more damage taken results in more damage reflected
        ⬩ Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> healing **decreases** since disintegrate results in less damage blocked

.
## __Hex: Chaos Traps__
.tag:chaos
Once the Chaos Traps rune <:chaostrapsrune:994206002658431016> is active from pad 5, traps will spawn in **__set__** locations. The locations on the map below are possible locations where the traps may spawn
⬥ Note that **traps respawn on every pad each time a new pad is charged**
⬥ To avoid being stunned and taking heavy damage, you can:
    • Step off each pad right as it finishes charging (new traps spawn with a slight delay)
    • Pick up the buff <:swordofedictsedict:1006128082266107954> near the sword before charging a new pad
    • <:anti:535541306475151390> + <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> + <:devo:513190158728953857> / <:reflect:535541258786177064> / <:res:535541258844635148> to step on a new pad without the <:swordofedictsedict:1006128082266107954> buff

## __Phase 7__
.tag:p7
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/73kNFau.png
At 100% enrage, phase 7 is introduced. Zamorak will enter Infernus and force the player in along with them.
⬥ When the phase starts:
    • The pad order from phases 1-6 is reversed
    • Zamorak starts immune to damage
    • A Chaos Demon will spawn which should be killed
    • Zamorak sends 2 <:Magic:689504724159823906> hits to all players
.
### Rune Calls
⬥ An amount of runes (2 in solo, otherwise equal to team size in group) will appear before Zamorak and stay there temporarily, **the order in which they appear is the order they must be defeated in**
⬥ At the same time Zamorak will begin charging a **new red HP bar, referred to as the chaos bar**, that determines the damage of upcoming mechanics
    • <:smiterune:994206048334393385> may be shown twice
    • Killing a rune will delay Zamorak from charging for 9 ticks (4 ticks at 1600%+ enrage)
    • Killing a rune out of order will deal heavy damage to all players
    • Runes uber heal after they are defeated, be careful not to kill it twice.
    • The rate of charge increases with enrage and caps at 8850%

⬥ After the last rune is defeated Zamorak stops charging, becomes damageable, and uses in this order:
    • [1] A single moderate <:melee:1096130867279171706> hit
    • [2] A large chaos damage hit
        ⬩ Soft typeless damage that is **equivalent to the chaos bar** that charges while killing runes
        ⬩ Make sure your team is spread out as it does damage in a small area around each player
        ⬩ Has a base **defence piercing** of 50%
    • [3] 4 additional small chaos damage hits
        ⬩ Deals damage based on a portion of the chaos bar and the amount of time it was allowed to charge for
        ⬩ Does not have base defence piercing but is **affected by Twinshot**

⬥ If Zamorak is not defeated before becoming immune on the 4th small chaos hit:
    • [4] Another Chaos Demon spawns
    • [5] Another moderate <:melee:1096130867279171706> hit
    • [6] Another large chaos damage hit
    • [7] Runes are called
    • Resets to [1] once last rune is defeated

.
⬥ Zamorak will have 100,000 to 250,000 health <:constitution:689509250887712902> per player during phase 7, capping at 1000% enrage
⬥ The Chaos Demon is the same as during the *Infernal Tomb* mechanic and will have 18,750 to 70,000 health <:constitution:689509250887712902>, capping at 1470% enrage
⬥ At 1000% enrage the **chaos bar** charge no longer resets between cycles, meaning the chaos damage will likely become unmanageable in a second cycle
    • It's generally expected for Zamorak to be low enough at this point to defeat before the large chaos hit reaches the player, <:rod:513190159462825984> can also be used to buy more time

⬥ Each small chaos damage hit is calculated as follows:
    •  `= floor(Iteration * Chaos_bar/100)` where `Iteration` refers to how many times the Charge value has increased (this gets delayed when killing a rune)

.
**Final phase (Solo <:Magic:689504724159823906> 440%)**

.
### Phase 7 General Strategy

**After entering Infernus:**
⬥ Team kills the Chaos Demon
⬥ Team kills runes as soon as they appear, **being careful not to kill them twice unintentionally**
⬥ Before killing the last rune, team gets ready to ult <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> and deal as much damage as possible in a short amount of time, **making sure to be spread out**
⬥ Team kills last rune and immediately get on Zamorak
    • You will want to <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and <:devo:513190158728953857> the melee hit
    • Use <:vitality:654618235097972737> + <:disrupt:535614336207552523> + <:reflect:535541258786177064> on the large hit, less defensives will be required with lower (<10k) charge
⬥ Repeat cycle if necessary

*Note: See enrage and style-specific Zamorak guides for full working rotations*

## __Enrage-Based Mechanics__
.tag:enrage
Zamorak's damage and HP scales with enrage, and additional mechanics are introduced at specific enrage thresholds:

⬥ **100%** Phase 7 is introduced.
⬥ **500%** During *Infernal Tomb*, all players must be on their rune at the same time to exit Infernus.
⬥ **500%** The chaos witch channelers in Infernus spawn with 50% adrenaline and the first ability they use will be Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>.
⬥ **750%** During *Infernal Tomb*, demons will move faster towards the portal.
⬥ **900%** During *Channelers*, **grey HP** will heal faster upon each Pad activation. Making depletion gradually impossible.
⬥ **1000%** During *Channelers*, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is Omnipower <:omni:535533809664262179>.
⬥ **1000%** On phase 7, charge damage is no longer reset between cycle(s).
⬥ **1000%** On phase 7, Zamorak's life points cap at 250,000 per player.
⬥ **1470%** The life points of chaos demons cap at 70,000 while on Infernus.
⬥ **1500%** During the Adrenaline Cage attack, the targeted player will have their Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> deactivated.
⬥ **1600%** Zamorak's stagger after killing a rune on Phase 7 reduced from 10 to 5 ticks.
⬥ **1740%** For phases 1-6, Zamorak's starting life points cap at 1,600,000 per player.
⬥ **3500%** On phase 7, the life points the runes revive with are capped at 60,000.
.
## __Helpful Tips__
.tag:tips
⬥ **Grey HP** won't regenerate on the ticks Zamorak takes damage, meaning DoT abilities such as <:dismember:535532879376023572> / <:bloat:1159433682403201044> / <:comb:535533833098100745> / <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> can be used before entering Infernus <:realmmovement:1073955377537876089> to prevent some healing
⬥ As Infernal Tomb starts, you can __on tick__ stun Zamorak by using <:freedom:535541258240786434> / <:anti:535541306475151390> as he assigns runes and using a stun as your character is lifted. [Example clip of proper stun timing here.](https://img.pvme.io/images/URj54bk2bF.mp4)
    • This will greatly reduce the damage dealt to players
⬥ You can stack <:stormshards:536256663641128971> to use with <:Shatter:536256673904328704> during phase 7
⬥ At high enrages the base can use <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> or <:enfeeble:567727986409734145> to reduce the damage dealt by autos
⬥ Ring of Death <:rod:513190159462825984> effect clears upon entering phase 7, along with Special Attack <:spec:537340400273195028> cooldowns
⬥ You may <:Cept:543478434509357098> other players and <:immort:535541258538582017> if multiple players will take a fatal attack at the same time
