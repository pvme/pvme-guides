> **__Enrage-Based Mechanics__**
.tag:enrage
Zamorak's damage and HP scales with enrage, and additional mechanics are introduced at specific enrage thresholds:

⬥ **500%** During Infernal Tomb, all players must be on their pad at the same time to exit Infernus.
⬥ **500%** The chaos witch channelers in Infernus spawn with 50% adrenaline and the first ability they use will be Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>.
⬥ **750%** During Infernal Tomb, demons will move faster towards the portal.
⬥ **900%** During Channelers, grey health will heal faster upon each Pad activation. Making depletion gradually impossible.
⬥ **1000%** During Channelers, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is Omnipower <:omni:535533809664262179>.
⬥ **1000%** On phase 7, charge damage is no longer reset between cycle(s).
⬥ **1000%** On phase 7, Zamorak's life points cap at 250,000 per player.

⬥ **3500%** On phase 7, the life points the runes revive with are capped at 60,000.

.
> **__Attack Rotation__**
.tag:attack
⬥ **Auto-attack cycle**
    • 5 Magic autos → 5 Ranged autos → Repeat (Special attacks get woven in)

.img:https://i.imgur.com/oFnot0X.png
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/K1u9v5j.png
.
*Notes: Phases end when the **draining HP bar is depleted.** Channeler HP carries over to draining, at 900% this becomes irrelevant as Zamorak will heal roughly ~22k hp per tick*

.
⬥ **Channelers**
    • A message will appear saying **`Zamorak begins to draw power and energy from something within Infernus.`** , this will spawn a Chaos Witch Channeler in Infernus
    • Players must enter Infernus with the extra ability button and defeat the witch before being able to activate the next rune
    • It is advised to <:anti:535541306475151390> / <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the witch
    • At 1000%, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is <:omni:535533809664262179>

⬥ **Flames of Zamorak**
    • Zamorak will yell **`The world will burn.`** and slam into the ground, dealing 2 melee hits and spawning Flames of Zamorak between the player with aggression and Zamorak
    • To deal with this, all players walk under boss, <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and use defensives if low hp
    • Black smoke (Flames of Zamorak) goes towards the a random player, the more smoke that is absorbed by a player the higher the typeless hit on them will be

.img:https://i.imgur.com/VtqJmsu.mp4

.
⬥ **Adrenaline Cage**
    • Zamorak will say **`Chaos, unfettered!`** then drop the prayers of those affected by the attack, preparing to bombard base with heavy magic attacks.
    • Remain still, <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> and use <:debil:535541278264393729> , <:reflect:535541258786177064> or <:devo:513190158728953857>

⬥ **Chaos Blast**
    • Zamorak will charge up his attack shouting **`I will tear you asunder!`**
    • To deal with the mechanic successfully stun him enough times, after such a damage requirement will appear to force him to launch the attack early
    • He will yell **`Feel the rage of a god.`** and send a red projectile that deals up to 25,000 soft typeless damage - this is reduced based on how fast he is interrupted
    • Use <:vitality:654618235097972737> / <:res:535541258844635148> / <:disrupt:535614336207552523> , at higher enrages you may need to use <:immort:535541258538582017>

.
⬥ **Infernal Tomb**
    • Zamorak says `Step into the dark... meet your death.`, targets players, assigns a rune to them overhead and transports them to Infernus where greater demons are marching towards a portal to the main arena
    • Most players elect to use a quick couple abilities to kill the demons (ideally <:caroming4:791281588792590336> <:gchain:787904334495088672> → ability)
    • Players must go to the pad with the same corresponding rune they received overhead
        - At higher enrages, it is highly suggested to pre-stun Zamorak and defeat all demons before exiting

*Note: 2 of the runes are the same, it doesn't matter which you exit from, another rune looks very similar. Going to the wrong pad will inflict massive damage to all party members.*

⬥ **Rune of Destruction**
    • Zamorak will yell `You're already dead.` and lay a massive red rune around him, with a gap between two circles
    • Black sludge will run clockwise or counterclockwise sometimes changing direction and applies stuns to those caught in it
    • Standing in the red areas will deal rapid soft typeless damage
    • The player cannot teleport to Infernus and runes cannot be charged for the duration of the attack

.tag:mech
⬥ **Charge Pads**
    • The arena has 6 pads that you can stand on to charge
    • When standing on an pad, it charges up at a speed relative to your distance from the center of the edict
    • When it is full charged, Zamorak will stop attacking for a while and your adrenaline bar will be refilled. After this, you will gain an **Edict** while Zamorak gains a **Hex** depending on the pad charged
    • You will become unable to charge pads when Zamorak says **`HEED MY CALL`**. To continue charging the next pad, you must enter Infernus and kill the mage present.
        - This happens after charging every pad.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/UOtlSkO.png
.

.
⬥ **Hexes and Edicts**
    • Every time a player activates a pad, they and Zamorak will gain a stack of currently active stacking edicts and hexes, respectively
    • This makes it such that stacks are accumulated as additional runes are activated
        - In other words, if you activate pads 6 → 5 → 4, once 4 is activated rune 6 will have 3 stacks, rune 5 will have 2 stacks and rune 4 will have 1 stack
        - A calculator has been made to gauge the effects of each activated Edict & Hex: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Calculator:Combat/Rune_pads>
    • *E.g. If the Affliction-Balance of Power pad is activated, after all pads are active the player will only heal 40% from food and have outgoing damage increased by 36% when below 60% lifepoints*

.tag:p7
.img:https://i.imgur.com/73kNFau.png
At 100% enrage, phase 7 is introduced. At the point where the fight would end before enrage, players will now be pulled into Infernus.
⬥ Once the phase has started:
    • A Chaos Demon will spawn which should be killed.
    • 2 <:Magic:689504724159823906> hits sent to all players
.
__**Rune Calls**__
⬥ An amount of runes (2 in solo, otherwise equal to team size in group) will appear before Zamorak and stay there temporarily, **the order in which they appear is the order they must be defeated in.**
    • **The same rune may occur twice.**
    • Killing a rune out of order results in players taking a large amount of damage.
    • Runes uber heal after they are defeated, be careful not to kill it twice.

⬥ After the last rune is defeated, Zamorak is attackable and uses in this order:
    • [1] A heavy <:melee:615612332521029632> hit
    • [2] A large soft typeless hit along with 4 additional hits.
        - The original hit before mitigation is **equivalent to the red HP bar** in place of the green HP bar visible when killing runes.
        - Make sure your team is spread out or it may hit over 10k even at 100% enrage.

⬥ If Zamorak is not defeated before becoming immune on the 4th additional typeles hit:
    • [3] Demon spawns followed by a heavy <:melee:615612332521029632> hit
    • [4] A large soft typeless hit
    • [5] Runes are called
    • Resets to [1] once last rune is defeated

**__Suggested Phase 7 Method__**

**After entering Infernus:**
⬥ Team kills the Chaos Demon
⬥ Team kills runes as soon as they appear, **being careful not to overkill them**
⬥ Before killing the last rune, team gets ready to ult <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> and deal as much damage as possible in a very short amount of time, **making sure to be spread out**
⬥ Team kills last rune and immediately get on Zamorak
    • You will want to <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>, <:vitality:654618235097972737> and <:debil:535541278264393729> before the attacks hit you
⬥ Repeat phase starting at killing the runes as many times as necessary

It doesn't matter if <:incend:535541258429661215> is without <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>'s buff.*

__**Suggested Low Enrage Strategy (Courtesy of <@190066298338803712>)**__
In 5-person team, assign people to NW/NE/SE/SW/Middle

⬥ Each person is responsible for the 2 runes close to them
⬥ Get all runes to about 10K HP while Zamorak starts giving the order
⬥ Once Zamorak gives the first rune, the respective people calls it out and kills the rune
⬥ Kill the runes one by one according to the order (not more than 2 people per rune to not overkill)
⬥ <:nat:535541258131865633> and <:tsunami:535533809995874304> / <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> on Zamorak meanwhile
⬥ Once runes are killed, spread out (the NW/NE players go behind the boss, other three spread around the boss) and DPS the boss as hard as possible

.
> **__Helpful Tips__**
.tag:tips
⬥ Stack <:stormshards:536256663641128971> and <:Shatter:536256673904328704> during phase 7
⬥ Walk under Zamorak as he does the melee slam to avoid spawning Flames of Zamorak
.
⬥ At high enrages the base should use <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> to reduce the damage dealt by <:Magic:689504724159823906> autos
⬥ DPSers should use <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on summoned coven and demons
⬥ Avoid using <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> right before phase 7 due to cooldown issues
⬥ If using <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> on phase 7, autocast <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> to heal losslessly during Zamorak's attacks
⬥ As Infernal Tomb starts, you can __on tick__ stun Zamorak by using <:freedom:535541258240786434> / <:anti:535541306475151390> as he assigns pushes the rune towards you and using a stun as your character is lifted
    • This will greatly reduce the damage dealt to players
⬥ You may <:Cept:543478434509357098> other players and <:immort:535541258538582017> if multiple players will take a fatal attack at the same time
