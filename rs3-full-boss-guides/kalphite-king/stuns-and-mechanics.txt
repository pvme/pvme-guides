## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
The [Kalphite King](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Kalphite_King>) <:kalphiteking:513212971409866765> is a powerful kalphite found within the [Exiled Kalphite Hive](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Exiled_Kalphite_Hive>) just north of Menaphos. KK can use three combat styles, but he will only use one style at a time with a set attack rotation for each style. At any time throughout the fight, KK can randomly change attack style, starting a new attack rotation.

KK is a significant step up in difficulty in comparison to other mid-tier bosses, requiring close tracking of auto attacks and specs, and the use of specific abilites at certain times to dodge one-hit mechanics.

Being on a Kalphite slayer task <:slayer:797896049548066857> is recommended as you gain the benefits of the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> and Genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870>

## __Kalphite King Attack Pattern__
.tag:attackpattern
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/oXYt0ZL.png
.

.
## __Player Stun Timings__
.tag:playerstun
Stunning KK at the right time is essential, allowing you skip certain mechanics that either waste time (charge & dig) or result in a death/failed kill (Green).

.
### Ranged Phase: Skips Green
2 Autos → Stun → 2 Autos → **Your Stun** → 2 Autos → Dig → Repeat

.
### Melee Phase: Skips Charge
2 Autos → Push → 2 Autos → **Your Stun** → 2 Autos → Green → Repeat

.
### Mage Phase: Skips Dig
4 Autos → **Your Stun** → 2 Autos → Charge → Repeat

.
## __Step-by-step Bladed Dive Guide__
.tag:bdguide
Don’t <:bd:535532854281764884> during ranged phase. Always skip green with a stun. If you use <:destroy:535532879330148352> remember to cancel after 1 GCD.
.
⬥ Melee charge happens or is skipped.
    • If learning, **not** skipping charge is recommended so you can learn how to get an accurate count on attacks.
⬥ Count 2 KK autos.
    • Equip shield or defender if you are learning. Can be done after <:bd:535532854281764884> when more experienced.
⬥ Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>
⬥ Let the boss green you
⬥ Queue <:bd:535532854281764884> and aim away from walls and minions
    • Never <:bd:535532854281764884> through KK
⬥ Look at the stun timer
⬥ As the timer drops from 4 to 3 seconds, click the Bladed Dive spot
⬥ Quickly equip shield or defender if not already equipped
⬥ <:devo:513190158728953857>, <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> (Only <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> if there are no minions)

*Note: If you get greened solo, you can spam Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and a teleport to avoid death.*

.
## __Strategies and Tips__
.tag:strats
### General
⬥ Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> before and Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> at the start of every kill.
⬥ Never stun outside of proper stun timings.
⬥ Stay close to the tank during digs but not in the surface radius.
⬥ Run with the boss during charges.
⬥ Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> at the start of Ranged <:range:580168050121113623> and Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> phases, use the other defensive when your first runs out.
⬥ Don’t stand directly between KK and a wall during melee or mage phase or you will be hit up to 5k.

.
### Melee Form <:Attack:689509250472476758>
⬥ Use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> on melee phase only after you receive both bleeds. If you <:freedom:535541258240786434> a Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> before you get Slaughtered <:slaughter:535532879237873666> be prepared to take hefty damage, especially if you get pushed.

.
### Ranged Form <:range:580168050121113623>
⬥ The amount of times you get hit by the standard attack while the Incendiary Shot icon <:incend:535541258429661215> is on your buff bar is the amount of times you will be hit by the Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>.
⬥ If you get a stun with the Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> after green, don’t freedom. Either wait until the stun clears and GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to KK when he surfaces or GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to minions to clear and then Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> back to KK.

.
### Magic Form <:Magic:689504724159823906>
⬥ Use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> during the first 4 autos of this phase so you can continue to attack the boss without moving.
⬥ Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> during charge.
⬥ Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the blue ball.
    • Usually happens the attack after charge if you forget how to count.

.
## __What you must avoid__
.tag:nop
### General
⬥ Never use Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>, Unload <:unload:535541258664411169>, or Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581>.
⬥ Attack minions at a time where the Kalphite King is still attackable.
⬥ Never stun outside of proper stun timings. If you do you could cause:
    • Early greens.
    • Early charges.
    • Early digs.
    • Skipped attacks.
    • A sped-up attack rotation.
⬥ Never stun during a Green. If you do you could cause:
    • Multiple greens.
    • Early digs.
    • Multiple digs.
⬥ Never Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for longer than 1 GCD or stun immediately after a dig or charge. If you do you could cause:
    • Early greens.
    • Multiple greens.
    • Early digs.
    • Infinite digs.

.
### Ranged Form <:range:580168050121113623>
⬥ Never use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> during the middle of a ranged phase rotation. Wait for the cycle to reset after dig.

.
### Magic Form <:Magic:689504724159823906>
⬥ Never use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> during mage phase unless the boss spawns in form.
