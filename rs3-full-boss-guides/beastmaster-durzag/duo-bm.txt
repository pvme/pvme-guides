**__Introduction__**
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

This guide assumes that you already have an understanding of mechanics of the fight - <#1020559520977666080>

.
**__The Strategies__**
⬥ There are two main strategies to duo BM:
    • **AoE stack strategy** - stacking and tanking everything at once, dealing damage with AoEs
    • **Entangle strategy** - uses entangle to get the 2nd pet stuck, reducing damage taken

.
**__General Notes__**
⬥ It will be significantly easier if the base tank uses <:eofspec:746403211908481184> with <:staffoflight:841419289319964763> , especially if they are tanking pets at the same time for the AoE strategy.
⬥ <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> Blood reaver with scrolls results in minimal food required
⬥ Cryptbloom <:cryptbloombody:892819107253194762> with animate dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382>


> __**AoE Stack Strategy**__
.tag:aoeStrat
⬥ Stand by the north gong where the 2nd pet spawns, and ideally deal damage to both the pets and BM using AoE attacks, i.e., standard <:soa:869284271595069451> FSOA rotation with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> blood barrage.

.
**__Stacking Phase__**
.

.
⬥ Stay in melee distance to the pet to only take melee damage whilst stacking the enemies.
⬥ Walk the pet/BM to stack them for AoEs if necessary.
⬥ Focus on killing one of the pets, particularly if stacking BM on the pet fails
⬥ <:prismofrestoration:938475261366784070> Prisms of restoration may not be able to spawn if surrounded by enemies - place the prism before starting, and extend it during the fight

⬥ The 3rd pet and chargers will spawn once the 2nd pet's health is lowered sufficiently - continue to deal damage with AoEs.

.
**__One Pet Dead__**
⬥ Base tank - run BM to avoid taking too much damage; stacks are only received from melee hits. Using emerald aurora <:emeraldaurora:914077639784935424> for additional damage reduction is helpful.
⬥ DPS player - finishes off the remaining pet. provoke <:voke:535541259465392143> and tank the pet, using <:voke:535541259465392143> again if it jumps onto the base tank.

.
**__Both Pets Dead__**
⬥ DPS player helps to kill BM - the DPS player can act as the backup tank, allowing the base tank to do their damage rotation.
⬥ Try not to run BM too far from the non-tank player's damage-boosting ultimate.

.
> __**Entangle Strategy**__
.tag:entStrat
⬥ Uses entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> to manipulate the 2nd pet, preventing it from attacking until you are ready to kill it.
⬥ This strategy aims to use chargers to block the 2nd pet.
    • Therefore, BM must not be in combat until you are ready to have it summon the chargers and 3rd pet.

.
**__Pet 2 Lure__**

.
*Note: Do **not** aggro BM*
1) Stand at the closest charger cage that is south of the west gong as the fight starts.
2) Wait for pet to jump to you → cast entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> on pet.
3) Do not attack, move to the southwest corner of the arena and wait for the pet to jump again.

.
4) Attack the pet; lower its health to around 25k.

.
**__Pet is Lowered - Getting it Stuck__**
1) Run towards the middle to aggro BM, cast reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> whilst doing this
2) Run back towards the pet - cast entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> on the pet as BM comes close, and use freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> or anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> as you will be stunned by the 3rd pet
3) Wait for chargers to spawn - just as the chargers start to move, surge <:surge:535533810004262912> east and go to the southeast corner
.

.
⬥ If done correctly, the entangle will prevent the pet from moving until the chargers get into position. Once in position, the chargers will block the pet.

.
**__Southeast Corner__**
⬥ Lower the 3rd pet/BM as you see fit.
⬥ Base tank - run BM when the 3rd pet dies to avoid taking too much damage; stacks are only received from melee hits. Using emerald aurora <:emeraldaurora:914077639784935424> for additional damage reduction is helpful.
⬥ DPS player finishes off the pet that is stuck.

**__Killing BM__**
⬥ DPS player can act as the backup tank, allowing the base tank to do their damage rotation.
⬥ Try not to run BM too far from the non-tank player's damage-boosting ultimate.
