> __**Duo BM**__
.tag:[tagname]
This guide assumes that you already have an understanding of mechanics of the fight - #beastmaster-basic

There are two main strategies to duo BM:

**AoE stack strategy** - stacking and tanking everything at once, dealing damage with AoEs
**Entangle strategy** - uses entangle to get the 2nd pet stuck, reducing damage taken

⬥ It will be significantly easier if the base tank uses :eofspec: with :staffoflight: , especially if they are tanking pets at the same time for the AoE strategy.
⬥ :reaverpouch: :reaverscroll: Blood reaver with scrolls results in minimal food required
⬥ Cryptbloom :cryptbloombody: with animate dead :animatedead:


> __**AoE Stack Strategy**__
Stand by the north gong where the 2nd pet spawns, and ideally deal damage to both the pets and BM using AoE attacks, i.e., standard :soa: FSoA rotation with :bloodbarrage: blood barrage.



**Stacking phase**

⬥ Stay in melee distance to the pet to only take melee damage whilst stacking the enemies.
⬥ Walk the pet/BM to stack them for AoEs if necessary.
⬥ Focus on killing one of the pets, particularly if stacking BM on the pet fails
⬥ :prismofrestoration: Prisms of restoration may not be able to spawn if surrounded by enemies - place the prism before starting, and extend it during the fight

The 3rd pet and chargers will spawn once the 2nd pet's health is lowered sufficiently - continue to deal damage with AoEs.


**One pet dead**
⬥ Base tank - run BM to avoid taking too much damage; stacks are only received from melee hits. Using emerald aurora :emeraldaurora: for additional damage reduction is helpful.
⬥ DPS player - finishes off the remaining pet. :voke: and tank the pet, using :voke: again if it jumps onto the base tank.


**Both pets dead**
DPS player helps to kill BM - the DPS player can act as the backup tank, allowing the base tank to do their damage rotation.
Try not to run BM too far from the non-tank player's damage-boosting ultimate.





> __**Entangle Strategy**__
Uses entangle to manipulate the 2nd pet, preventing it from attacking until you are ready to kill it

Do not aggro BM
1.  Stand at the closest charger cage that is south of the west gong as the fight starts.
2.  Wait for pet to jump to you → cast entangle :entangle: on pet.
3.  Do not attack, move to the southwest corner of the arena and wait for the pet to jump again.

4.  Attack the pet; lower its health to around 25k.


**Pet is lowered - getting it stuck**
1. Run towards the middle to aggro BM, cast reflect :reflect: whilst doing this
2. Run back towards the pet - cast :entangle: on the pet as BM comes close
3. Wait for chargers to spawn - just as the chargers start to move, surge :surge: east and go to the southeast corner

If done correctly, the entangle will prevent the pet from moving until the chargers get into position. Once in position, the chargers will block the pet.

**Southeast corner**
⬥ Lower the 3rd pet/BM as you see fit.
⬥ Base tank - run BM when the 3rd pet dies to avoid taking too much damage; stacks are only received from melee hits. Using emerald aurora :emeraldaurora: for additional damage reduction is helpful.
⬥  DPS player finishes off the pet that is stuck.

**Killing BM**
DPS player can act as the backup tank, allowing the base tank to do their damage rotation.
Try not to run BM too far from the non-tank player's damage-boosting ultimate.
