### General
Any weapon that isn't a spear will deal half damage, so melee is the only style that should be used at this boss. If you don't have a T92 spear then a reaper necklace is greatly preferred over the amulet of souls, as you do not have 100% hit chance. The Masuta's Warspear does work at Corporeal Beast and may be used in a solo situation as you will not have to prayer flick for melee swipes, however this is less optimal.
