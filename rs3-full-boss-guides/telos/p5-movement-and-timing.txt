## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
This quick reference aims to address two common pain points for aspiring Telosers in P5:
⬥ Understanding the timing for targeting Telos and starting your rotation
⬥ Learning how to efficiently move into, and switch between beams

.
## __Start Timing__
.tag:timing
### Visual Cue
During the P5 cutscene, fonts will execute a brief "shifting" animation. The tick **after** this animation is the first tick that Telos can be target-cycled ("tc"). This animation + 1t delay will serve as the starting point for the opening rotation, for example:

⬥ (font shift) → (wait 1t) → (tc) + <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>
⬥ (font shift) → (wait 1t) → (tc) + <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> → (wait 2t) → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:splitsoul:1137809168368148490>
⬥ (font shift) → (wait 1t) → (tc) + <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:grico:787904334812807238>
⬥ (font shift) → (wait 1t) → (tc) + <:divert:787904334377648130> → (wait 2t) → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:reflect:535541258786177064>

*Notes:
⬥ Make sure your target cycle maximum distance is set to **9**
⬥ These example starting rotations may be out of date - check the respective guides*

## __Movement & Positioning__
.tag:movement
### Overview
There is no "one right way" to move efficiently in P5. The player can experiment with each method and find what works best for them. The primary goals are to:

⬥ Move into the initial green beam spawn efficiently so as to maximize adrenaline gain
⬥ Switch beams efficiently, either as part of moving into the green beam, or at a later time in order to acquire a buff or clear a virus <:redvirus:853191856350560266> <:greenvirus:853191856182657064> <:blackvirus:853191855856287746>

.
### Positioning & Movement Inputs
In order to move well throughout P5, it's important to first have a basic understanding of positioning, and how it affects what movement abilities you can use. To keep it simple, **always aim to be 1 to 3 tiles away from <:telos:513212949033123840>**.

__**Side Beam Switching**__
If you are in a **side** beam, and you are **1 to 3 tiles away**, you can:

⬥ <:surge:535533810004262912> + <:dive:1049378668197195808> directly into the opposing side beam ([demo](<https://youtu.be/z3_azrtzXm0>))
⬥ <:surge:535533810004262912> + walk or <:dive:1049378668197195808> into back beam ([demo](<https://youtu.be/mJXEZznIBUw>))

.
*Note: if you are using <:surge:535533810004262912> diagonally though <:telos:513212949033123840> from a side beam as part of your movement strategy, it is important to click <:telos:513212949033123840> first while in the beam. This will force your character to face him and ensure you <:surge:535533810004262912> the right way.*

.
__**Back Beam Switching**__
If you are in **back** beam, and you are **1 to 2 tiles away**, you can:

⬥ <:dive:1049378668197195808> directly into either side beam ([demo](<https://youtu.be/MP4z0bUPPK0?si=4BfaWB3AwrEaooKH>))

If you are in **back** beam, and you are **3 tiles away**, you can:

⬥ Take 1 step diagonally → <:surge:535533810004262912> directly into either side beam ([demo](<https://youtu.be/f11Jjp_TYKk>))


### General Approach to Beam Entry
Entering the initial green beam spawn efficiently is key. The beam's position is random, so the player has to adapt accordingly. As mentioned earlier, there is no "one right way"; however, most players follow one of these two approaches - experiment with what feels best.

**__Option A: Run Towards Left Beam__**
⬥ On first actionable tick, **start running towards the left beam** spawn while casting abilities
⬥ As beams spawn, note which one is green, and adapt accordingly:
    • If **left** beam, simply **continue to run** into position
    • If **back** beam, **enter left beam position**, then use the above strategies to **switch beams** from left → back ([demo](<https://youtu.be/hEDHrJ3sLrU>))
    • If **right** beam, either:
        ⬩ **Click above & right** of <:telos:513212949033123840>, **wait** until character rounds the corner, then <:surge:535533810004262912> + **walk** north → click <:telos:513212949033123840> next tick to stop perfectly in beam ([demo](<https://youtu.be/nFjiKdA_guQ>))
        ⬩ Or, **enter left beam position**, then use the above strategies to **switch beams** from left → right

.
**__Option B: Surge to Centre__**
⬥ Cast opening ability and wait specified time as per rotation (e.g. 2 ticks), then <:surge:535533810004262912> directly towards the centre of <:telos:513212949033123840>
⬥ As beams spawn, note which one is green, and adapt accordingly:
    • If **left or right** beam, simply <:dive:1049378668197195808> into position ([demo](<https://youtu.be/ReXIiJVFpNM?si=ZJRmX2cyrCwa_cF2&t=361>))
    • If **back** beam, <:dive:1049378668197195808> **into side beam position**, then use the above strategies to **switch beams** from side → back
