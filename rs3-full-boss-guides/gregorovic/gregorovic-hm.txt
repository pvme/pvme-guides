## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
Sliske's general in the Heart of Gielinor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be one of the harder GWD2 bosses for learners. He requires 80 prayer and 40 Sliske killcount to fight. In challenge mode (herein called Hard Mode) he gains additional phases.

This guide is primarily aimed at those needing 100 killcount for the Insane Final Boss title.

If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned. The ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium.
