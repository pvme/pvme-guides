.tag:intro
Sliske's general in the Heart of Glienor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be one of the harder GWD2 bosses for learners. He requires 80 prayer and 40 Sliske killcount to fight. In challenge mode (herein called Hard Mode) he gains additional phases.

Note: This guide has high requirements and is primarily aimed at those needing 100 killcount for the Insane Final Boss title.

> **__Tips and Tricks__**
.tag:tips
⬥ <:dive:1049378668197195808> +<:surge:535533810004262912> upon entering ensure your conjures are in the arena.
⬥ With a swift DPS rotation Greg's Phase 1 mechanics and poison damage can be ignored. <:darkness:1137809209782698024> can be used if damage taken is high, or eat <:blueblubber:689530593742291033>
⬥ On Phase 2 conjures, familiars (at time of testing) and dreadnips do **not** work. <:poisonicon:944649693500154006> **does** work and is therefore recommended, despite HM Greg being <:poisonicon:944649693500154006> immune.
⬥ On phase 2 <:surge:535533810004262912> into a corner helps group up the wights to bring them down quickly.
⬥ On phase 2 wights might need to be reclicked multiple times as autoattacking halts when eating or moving.
⬥ Adrenaline can be build while killing wights, which speeds up the final phase. Similarly, you can use <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> and <:commandskeleton:1137809194423160883> while killing the 6th wight to save time for phase 3.
