This is a guide that focuses on how to achieve the pvme feat "nopenopenope" in the featsmastery and feats. This guide will focus on the ranged style as it's the easiest style to get a successful kill.

.
## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
This is an **advanced guide** which assumes a strong underlying knowledge of all mechanics and information presented in <#1020559475511406632> and also assumes great understanding of ranged abilities and combat style in order to successfully complete this challenge.

*DISCLAIMER: You must wear bronze armor and mainhand bronze crossbow throughout the entire fight and **cannot unequip it during the fight!** This limits your DPS and lack of mainhand weapon perks as well as armor perks.*

*You can only attempt this challenge/feat when the minion path is open. Whether you choose to attempt the feat on top path/bottom path rotation or top path/middle path rotation is a matter of preference. Every 4 days Araxxor changes it's rotation by closing one of the three paths and opening one of the other paths.*

*Since Araxxor's daily enrage starts at 0%, it would require 15 kc to reach 300 enrage and during the push towards 300 enrage, feel free to get through the kills as fast as possible and be efficient.*

### Preset Notes

⬥ It is recommended to have the *NopeNopeNope* <:nopenopenope:1006123123994808370> perk from Player Owned Farms active.

⬥ Have the spirit spider pre-summoned so you can save inventory space. It will likely die during the encounter, but as part of the challenge it is just there for the thematics.

⬥ Don't be afraid to use defensives <:reflect:535541258786177064>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:debil:535541278264393729>, <:immort:535541258538582017>, <:devo:513190158728953857>, and <:cade:535541306353778689> throughout the fight to reduce damage taken as this will be a long encounter.

⬥ Additionally, having <:ingen:641339234111848463> unlocked will be very helpful, especially when using strong abilities such as <:sgb:626466665848242186><:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, as your accuracy will be low.

.
⬥ Prioritizing <:sharp:643505377291534366> over <:reckless:643505179378974748> will help with taking a bit less damage at the cost of slightly less DPS. Also, having either <:deathward:697808774068699286> or <:fontoflife:698225967679930408> is helpful too as bronze armor has almost no damage reduction and poor armor ratings.

⬥ The <:zemouregalsnexus:1179716261681307728> in inventory allows <:greaterboneshield:1137809118283976814> to cast defensive abilities as well as <:darkness:1137809209782698024> incantation.

⬥ <:blessedflask:659122178704408598> saves inventory space allowing more room for supplies.

⬥ <:graspingpouchblue:892816437406728252> and <:graspingpouchgreen:892816437385756752> for runes to cast <:sbslunars:565726489467682816> + <:disrupt:535614336207552523>.

⬥ Having <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226> active prefight helps with mitigating prayer drain and getting prayer back as one will take a lot of damage over the course of the encounter.

⬥ Having <:firemaking:1011705727041163396> (or <:pantheonaura:982264010126819380> might of het boost) and an thermal bath or <:thermalflask:689530593796423724> will help with survivability too as you need all the hp boost you can get.

⬥ <:p6:712073088769982475> for <:ascoh:513190159362031631> because every bit of damage helps in this long encounter and <:absorbative4:890542428556230666> for <:elysianspiritshield:690976217792250007> to reduce more damage overall.

### Top Path (You must take this path!)
.tag:top
⬥ **Phase 1**

    • This phase is timegated, but with the low amount of DPS that you will be doing, it will take you significant time to get Araxxor's HP down to less than 5k. It will still be imperative that one starts the web burning right as Araxxor climbs down from the hive.

    • After burning the web, use strong ranged abilities such as <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386>, <:snap:535534127131394088>, <:rapid:535541270521708566> while in <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> after burning the web to deal good damage on Araxxor. Also, be mindful of Araxxor's special mechanics especially the web shield.

    *• Araxxor will never use the same special mechanic twice in a row. (e.g if he uses web shield, the next special mechanic after 5 auto attacks will either be cocoon or cleave.).*

    • Make sure to have <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:anti:535541306475151390> off cooldown at least by the 4th-5th autoattack in order to prepare for any special mechanics. This is important when you get webbed or cocoon mechanic as having either <:freedom:535541258240786434> or <:anti:535541306475151390> active will mean you can break out of the cocoon faster.

    *• Hint: Try not to use strong attacks (especially <:sgb:626466665848242186><:eofspec:1257438999794946099>) right after the 5th auto-attack as if the next mechanic is a web shield, you would end up taking A LOT of reflect damage.*

.
⬥ **Phase 2**

    • Do not start immediately go towards the middle long path but try to keep Araxxor at the starting path and kill ALL minions as each minion alive is a drain on supplies, nuisance, and may even be dangerous if left alive.

    • When dealing with minions, prioritze killing the mirrorback and pulsing spiders, and try to save <:devo:513190158728953857> when killing them as each dead minion will extend the duration of <:devo:513190158728953857> up to 20s.

    • It is recommended to kill off all the minions in Phase 2 so that way it doesn't spawn in Phase 4, and you would take less damage from them. Utilizing some AoE abilities such as <:grico:787904334812807238>, <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> are helpful, but be careful if Araxxor has web shield on or if a mirrorback spider is alive.

    • Also remember to lure the flaming projectile onto the eggs as to not as much damage and no additional minions spawn as that would only waste your supplies and increase your likelihood of death.

.
⬥ **Phase 3**

    • Depending on whichever path is open, be aware of Araxxor's specials depending on which path is open.

*If acid (middle) path is open, then Araxxor will summon highly acidic spiders as part of the mechanics.*

*If darkness (bottom) path is open, then Araxxor will submerge the arena in darkness with a spotlight to stand in to avoid damage while the mechanic is going.*

In this phase, it is important to get Araxxor LP down to 0 to continue onwards to Phase 4. If Araxxor's LP has been depleted in Phases 1 and 2, then in Phase 3, he shouldn't have a lot of LP healed through the spiders above.

Continue to have <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:anti:535541306475151390> off cooldown and only use it around each 4th auto attack or so.
.
## __Phase 4__
.tag:p4
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/tre38AT5bW.png
You have made it to Phase 4, and in this phase there are a few mechanics to keep in mind.

Araxxi will continue to use the mechanics that Araxxor has and she can attack with all styles so prayer switching is a must!

Additionally, she will still use special mechanics and it's important to have <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:anti:535541306475151390> off cooldown.

Utilize defensives such as <:reflect:535541258786177064>, <:anti:535541306475151390>, <:debil:535541278264393729>, <:immort:535541258538582017>, <:devo:513190158728953857>, and <:cade:535541306353778689> to help reduce damage, however, keep in mind if you get the cocoon mechanic or dragged in via the cleave, your defensives will be cancelled.

Araxxi, similarly to Araxxor will not use the same special back to back. However, she may either absorb any leftover acid from the previous phase or use darkness depending on the path opened.

.
Also, the use of <:ingen:641339234111848463> + <:sgb:626466665848242186><:eofspec:1257438999794946099> to deal good damage to Araxxi and getting her to lower than 50k lp is important. Preferably if it is done while inside a <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121>.

At less than 50k lp, Araxxi stops using special attacks and starts to get enraged, so she only uses auto-attacks. During this time, you can freely use defensives without worry of Araxxi's mechanics cancelling or taking them off.

*⬥ Optionally, having <:elysianspiritshield:690976217792250007> to tank some hits can also help too.*

At less than 25k lp, Araxxi will release a putrid sludge that does a lot of typeless damage if it hits. Also the ability <:reprisal:513190159462694912> will be very helpful as your DPS will be very low and every bit of damage you deal to Araxxi will help in finishing the encounter.

*⬥ Using <:reprisal:513190159462694912> will take some time but you are free to cast abilities and move around while it is still active. Keep in mind if you <:signoflife:1005552211847295076> before <:reprisal:513190159462694912> goes off then the effect will prematurely end. However, if <:rod:513190159462825984> effect activates, it will still retain it's effect.*

(More mechanics and details coming soon).
