.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/sY7JVkg9No.png
.
## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
*Note: a **Table of Contents** can be found in the pins.*

⬥ Solo Hardmode Vorago is one of the hardest PvM challenges in the game and will require good improvisation skills. Therefore, a strong understanding of the combat system is required.
⬥ A basic understanding of the boss and P10/11 pushback is assumed and strong knowledge of solo normal mode P5 will translate well to hardmode and save time learning
    • It is recommended to read <#1237150284317200524> first to make sure you have a base knowledge of solo Vorago
    • It is assumed you have 6/6 solo NM Vorago before attempting this
        ⬩ A good goal before starting is to solo all normal mode weeks before 2nd spec

## __Phase 3 - Phase 8 Overview__
.tag:p38
.
⬥ The P3-P8 written below **focuses on surviving even if substantial time is lost**
    • There are instances where a phase is elongated to add ease to the follow phase by waiting on cooldowns
        ⬩ Turn away if looking for speed

⬥ **The start of most phases starts the exact same** (will refer to this as the pre-phase)
    • <:conjurearmy:1166094935066423348> → <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> → <:commandghost:1159434409913634816> → <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174> → <:commandskeleton:1137809194423160883>
        ⬩ If done without tick loss, the next ability can be target cycled on the first tick Vorago is attackable
    • Aim to also re-set <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> autofire to 1 during each pre-phase
⬥ Besides these starting abilities, most of the phases rely on improvisation and only general rotation guidelines will be provided

.
### __P3: Ceiling Collapse__
.tag:p3
.
⬥ Target cycle + <:ingen:641339234111848463> + <:deathskulls:1159434663903899728>
    • If you miss a tick you will hit yourself on reflect
⬥ <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> during reflect
    • <:divert:787904334377648130> 2nd bomb
    • You can <:deathskulls:1159434663903899728> before reflect ends due to its travel time

### __P4: Scopulus__
.tag:p4
.
⬥ Can omit <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> from the pre-phase since it will be applied later in the phase
⬥ Start south so that you can tc + <:deathskulls:1159434663903899728> and have it bounce between the south two Scopulus
⬥ <:touchofdeath:1137809175980810380> second ability to be able to quickly build <:necrosis:1139452791878856805>
⬥ Run up either east / west wall while building <:necrosis:1139452791878856805> + <:residualsoul:1139453152169558046>
    • You will run in a giant circle during this entire phase, **direction does not matter**

⬥ At 8 <:necrosis:1139452791878856805> and 2 <:residualsoul:1139453152169558046>: target cycle + <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> → <:threadsoffate:1137809172335951933> → <:soulsap:1137809140476031057> → <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> → <:deathguard90:1138809243143766118> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>
    • Target cycle to a different scop since you are likely to kill the one you have been focusing on with volley
⬥ Scops are low health so <:devo:513190158728953857> can be used to get +10s from killing 2 of them
⬥ <:bloat:1159433682403201044> is also recommended since it will spread to the other scops when one dies with <:bloat:1159433682403201044> on it
⬥ End on high adrenaline for the next phase

.tag:p5
.
⬥ Can omit <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> from the pre-phase since it will be applied later in the phase
⬥ Very important to set reaver to 1 + <:prismofrestoration:938475261366784070> as part of the pre-phase

        ⬩ This will kill all the Vitalis around you and let you run to clear bleeds

⬥ Pre-run away from Vorago and the next Vit orb to clear bleeds
    • Save <:freedom:535541258240786434> for emergencies
    • <:surge:535533810004262912> <:dive:1049378668197195808> to clear bleeds but always keep running
        ⬩ Aim to stay away from the Vitalis
    • <:vitality:654618235097972737> can be used to tank bleeds in a pinch
        ⬩ If you do this, remember it next phase since you wont have it for green bomb

### __P9: Waterfall__
.tag:p9
.
⬥ Same as normal mode
⬥ Set up in preparation for P10/11
    • Make sure <:darkness:1137809209782698024> <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> are applied
    • <:grim:568262896375824385> is turned on
    • If Vit week, summon <:icenihil:854475442164334592>
    • Cast <:disrupt:535614336207552523> in the last waterfall except on Ceilings/Teamsplit since they start with Teamsplit P10
    • <:maul:736524968174682132> Build the maul

.
## __P10/11 Overview__
.tag:p10
.
### __Stalling Vorago__
.
⬥ One of the most important thing for this phase is extending the amount of time you have to do damage
⬥ Keep Vorago moving (Push/Pushback) because this stalls out his next attack
    • String together lots of damage at the same time
        ⬩ <:omniguard:1138809234922934282> <:spec:537340400273195028> used during <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> to keep the push going
    • Do not waste <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, instead use it only when about to maul or if the blue would not extend your DPS window
        ⬩ For example, the blue right before you bomb stack usually lands after reflect starts. This is the optimal bomb to <:disrupt:535614336207552523>
⬥ When you <:cade:535541306353778689> since there is minimal push and no push-back Vorago will quickly throw out autos

.
### __Applying Debuffs__
.
⬥ Aim to apply <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174> <:commandghost:1159434409913634816> <:darkness:1137809209782698024> when in a TeamSplit or when running out to bomb stack
    • <:commandskeleton:1137809194423160883> <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> can also be used at the end of these to maximise the damage window from them
    • This is VERY important on P10 TeamSplit week due to the minimal damage windows

.
### __Defence Scaling__
.
⬥ Upkeeping <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174> is of utmost importance to raise your hitchance from ~87% to 100%
    • Stacks applied P10 carry over into P11
        ⬩ On Ceilings / Scopulus / Purple Bomb it is important to end P10 at 100% hitchance <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174>

.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/0Q3BRGz.png
.
⬥ Vorago will increase its defence based on how close it is from maul spot, starting at 90 defence and scaling up to 97.
    • If you get pushed back from the starting point it won't decrease below 90.
    • For P11 this means he starts with the higher defense, and loses it as you push him

.
### __Stacking Bombs__
.
⬥ Anytime you are melee distance to Vorago, you run a chance of either getting a blue or a melee hit + blue, so stacks are not perfectly consistent

⬥ **3 auto stack:**
    • Consists of a 9-11 tile blue → 2-3 tile blue → md auto to potentially negate 2 autos worth of pushback
    • So, stand 9-11 tiles away, wait for the first blue to release, <:dive:1049378668197195808> into 2-3 tile range, wait for the second blue to release, then walk md
    • This requires the player to not attack the boss in order to prepare for a 9-11 square auto. Also, pushing the boss during a triple stack will ruin it
    • For solo hm in particular, this is useful for P10/P11 reflects that are not barricaded <:cade:535541306353778689>
.

.
⬥ **2 auto stack:**
    • Consists of a 2-3 tile blue → md auto to potentially negate 1 auto worth of pushback
    • If done outside of a reflect, take this time to use weaker abilities to build adrenaline. Pushing the boss while trying to stack will stagger the auto timings
    • For solo hm in particular, this is useful for P10/P11 to stack 1st and 2nd autos of reflect if close to instakill ledge
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/PNOiPlW.mp4

.
⬥ **PB stack:**
    • Consists of a PB landing + blue to potentially negate 1 auto worth of pushback
    • Can go a step further and combine this with other stack methods to negate even more pushback

.
### __Broken TeamSplit__
.
⬥ A broken TS <:brokents:975012160675647538> will occur for every teamsplit immediately after a reflect
    • **TeamSplit Week**: Even-numbered TeamSplits during P10
    • **Scopulus Week**: TeamSplits during P10
    • **Green Bomb Week**: TeamSplits during P11

⬥ Vorago will be able to attack much sooner than normal during a <:brokents:975012160675647538>
    • If Vorago pushes you due to receiving damage after the <:brokents:975012160675647538> spawns the teamsplit will be more broken than usual
        ⬩ It will throw 2 blue bombs <:bluebomb:923249600276615200> one a tick next to each other during or before the explosion
    • If Vorago doesn't push you back it will result in a usual broken teamsplit, throwing the first blue bomb during or shortly after its explosion

⬥ Use one of the following to un-break TS: <:deathspark:1143642264850141205> / <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> / <:deathguard90:1138809243143766118> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:omniguard:1138809234922934282> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • Using <:commandskeleton:1137809194423160883> / <:commandzombie:1137809191231295549> during the TS can help immensely as well

    • Example of an extremely broken teamsplit, where you get pushed back after the teamsplit spawns:

    • Example of a usual broken teamsplit, where you **don’t** get pushed back after the teamsplit spawns:

### __Vitalis Orbs and Red Bombs__
.
⬥ **2-4 Vitalis spawn every orb in hardmode**
    • Often you will not have line of sight of all of them
    • Multiple can spawn on the same tile
⬥ **The goal should be to instantly deal with vits**, and often you will want to be under <:cade:535541306353778689>
⬥ Necromancy alleviates most of the issues of vits once you get used to the timing
    • <:dommine:662249620579155968> + <:invokedeath:1137809121983336548> → <:threadsoffate:1137809172335951933> → <:volleyofsouls:1159435029592686642> / <:deathguard90:1138809243143766118> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> should deal with them
        ⬩ Make sure to have 5 <:residualsoul:1139453152169558046> or at least 8 <:necrosis:1139452791878856805>

⬥ Target cycle before you can see them physically spawn (usually on vit orb explosion)
    • It is worth it to lose ticks while vit orb is coming out to get the target cycle timing correct
    • In this example, watch for when the EoF keybind (on the bottom action bar) lights up for the target cycle timing
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/62f4JyxcH3.mp4

.
⬥ Stay roughly in the center of where vits spawn to have the highest likelihood of no LoS issues
⬥ If you miss the target cycle or do not have LoS of some of the vits, focus on maintaining LoS with Vorago above all
    • Otherwise he will free walk forwards and you will lose a lot of squares of push
⬥ This clip misses target cycle but manages to keep LoS of Vorago and then maneuver to a position to get LoS to kill the vit which ran away
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/dRmPHHeLmN.mp4

.
⬥ Vitalis will **still block LoS even during death animation**. Make sure to get back into LoS of Vorago by running MD
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/QDZAkc4xQ2.mp4

.
⬥ After 24 Vitalis have spawned, no more can spawn
    • The vit orb explosion will still deal 1 square of pushback, but just dont get hit by it
    • If only 1 Vitalis spawned on a Vit orb, the cap has been reached (since at minimum 2 will spawn in other scenarios)
        ⬩ This does NOT happen on Vitalis week
⬥ If Vorago is within 3 tiles of pushing you off P10 or 6 tiles P11, he will throw out a red bomb instead of a vit orb
    • This comes with the standard non-homing blue
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/tquHWoDjTP.mp4

.
⬥ This can be utilised to slowly work towards vit cap by greatly staggering when vits come out
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> will always be up when dealing with vits this way
⬥ This can lead to "Red Bomb Hell"
    • Since you are close to the edge, you are no longer able to do a 3-stack during reflect
    • It takes a lot of push to get away from the edge and get back to spawning vit orbs
    • Having <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> ready for the push immediately after the red bomb spawns can help alleviate this

.
### __Mauling__
.
⬥ **It is very important to maul at a specific time rather than whenever Vorago is in maul spot**
.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/9tJk0aI.png

.
⬥ The goal for maul-timing is **to avoid Vitalis for the longest period of time**. There are two options for this:
    • First option is to maul whenever it would take the longest for the Vit orb spec to happen
    • Second option is to maul whenever Vit orb is next, but you force the red bomb special instead

⬥ **There are a few main exceptions to this rule**
    • Teamsplit does not have Vitalis either phase
        ⬩ Maul on Reflect
    • Green bomb does not have Vitalis on P11
        ⬩ If you do not vit-cap, maul whenever as long as you believe you can consistently do the P11
        ⬩ If you do vit-cap, maul on Reflect
    • Vitalis has Vitalis on P10 and P11
        ⬩ Maul on reflect to be able to deal with bleeds effectively P11

.
## __Ceilings P10/11 Overview__
.tag:p10ceilings
.
⬥ **P10 is TeamSplit/Green Bomb:**
    • Stall out this phase to be able to reach 100% hitchance <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174> before going into P11 to be able to deal with vits
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> after TeamSplit
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> the end of reflect
    • <:vitality:654618235097972737> / <:wardentop90:1142770709530161192> <:wardenlegs90:1142770705688174652> to tank the Green Bombs
⬥ Maul either on GB release or on Reflect
    • If mauling on reflect you will want to bait out the red bomb start of P10

⬥ **P11 is TeamSplit/Vitalis:**
    • When learning, <:threadsoffate:1137809172335951933> may not be off cooldown every vit orb for target cycle
        ⬩ Just <:threadsoffate:1137809172335951933> when possible and potentially you will have to kill vits during TeamSplit
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> either after TeamSplit or before Vit orb
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> during reflects
        ⬩ <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> is **needed** to maximise <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> due to tight damage windows this week
        ⬩ Do not rely on <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> + <:divert:787904334377648130> without <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541>

.
## __Scopulus P10/11 Overview__
.tag:p10scop
.
⬥ **P10 is PB/Broken TS:**
    • Stall out this phase to be able to reach 100% hitchance <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174> before going into P11 to be able to deal with vits
    • Very large damage window after broken teamsplit to do a full <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> rotation
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> during PB such that it lasts through reflect
⬥ Mauling on reflect and baiting out the red bomb the start of P11 is the easiest
    • It is hard to maul on TS

⬥ **P11 is PB/Vitalis:**
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> end of reflect to be able to deal with vitalis
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> end of reflects when you dont have <:cade:535541306353778689>
    • <:bloat:1159433682403201044> isn't cleared by either mechanic and will always run the full duration, making it very strong

.
## __Vitalis P10/11 Overview__
.tag:p10vit
.
⬥ **P10 is Vit/PB:**
    • Use <:cade:535541306353778689> solely for dealing with Vitalis
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> at the end of reflect or during purple bomb
    • <:bloat:1159433682403201044> isn't cleared by either mechanic and will always run the full duration, making it very strong
    • Resummon <:hellhoundpouch:921410226475925514> once you are at 100% hitchance <:invokelordofbones:1176968330582700174>
⬥ Maul on reflect
    • To do so, get Vorago into maul position before vit orb spawns
    • <:cadeturtling:867678153883516958> and run melee distance

⬥ **P11 is Vit/Bleeds:**
    • **The beginning of this phase is where you are most likely to fail**
    • Save <:disrupt:535614336207552523> for start of P11
        ⬩ Vorago will throw 3 blue bombs before bleeds start
        ⬩ If using <:escape:535541258832052231> to clear bleeds, you need to stand melee distance + have not lost any tiles
        ⬩ <:omniguard:1138809234922934282> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotation works well to get the 2 tiles you need
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> is for dealing with vitalis
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> end of reflects
    • <:bloat:1159433682403201044> isn't cleared by either mechanic and will always run the full duration, making it very strong

.
## __Green Bomb P10/11 Overview__
.tag:p10gb
.
⬥ **P10 is GB/Vit:**
    • This is the hardest phase to aim to vit cap
    • <:vitality:654618235097972737> / <:wardentop90:1142770709530161192> <:wardenlegs90:1142770705688174652> to tank the Green Bombs
    • Red Bomb Hell is even harder to deal with since to trigger a red bomb you must be even closer to the edge on P10 than in P11
    • <:cade:535541306353778689> to deal with vits
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> end of reflects
    • <:bloat:1159433682403201044> isn't cleared by either mechanic and will always run the full duration, making it very strong
⬥ Maul on reflect if you have vit-capped
    • If not, maul at any point if you believe you can salvage the P11

⬥ **P11 is GB / Broken TS:**
    • <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> in broken TS
        ⬩ Aim to always have <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541>, do not rely on <:livingdeath:1159434908486357072> + <:divert:787904334377648130>

⬥ Maul on Reflect
    • <:disrupt:535614336207552523> the 3rd bomb after TS while Vorago is in maul spot to do so
