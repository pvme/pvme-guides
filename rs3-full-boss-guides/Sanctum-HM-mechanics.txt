## __Introduction__
.tag:intro
The Sanctum of Rebirth is a boss dungeon set in the Underworld. Formerly owned by Amascut, three soul devourer bosses can be fought after completion of the [Soul Searching](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Searching>) miniquest. This guide focuses on the boss's rotations and mechanics for the **Hard Mode** version. Only in Hard Mode is the [Shard of Genesis Essence](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Shard_of_Genesis_Essence>) dropped that upgrades Tier 95 weapons to Tier 100.

.
## __Vermyx, Brood Mother__

.
### __Auto-attacks__
⬥ Vermyx uses both [Melee](<https://img.pvme.io/images/C31eiH1xcj.mp4>) <:melee:1096130867279171706> and [Ranged](<https://img.pvme.io/images/yDjvHTmoY8.mp4>) <:range:580168050121113623> auto-attacks, while Coilspawns only attack with Ranged <:range:580168050121113623>
    • Auto-attacks cause 2% armour break per successful hit
⬥ Every auto-attack Vermyx's adren bar fills by 50%, starting a new mechanic when full.
⬥ Starts at 4 Brood Mother Bond stacks in HM
        ⬩ 15% extra damage dealt by Vermyx per coilspawn alive
⬥ You can flank <:flank4:712073088296157185> by standing right next to Vermyx's head.*

.
### __Vermyx Rotation__
### Phase 1 (start: 600k/player)
3 autos →
Moonstone Shards → 2 autos → Wyrmfire + 2 autos → repeat

### Phase 2 (start: 450k/player)
3 autos →
Moonstone shards → 2 autos → Soul Bomb → 1 auto + bomb hit (in that order) → 1 auto → Wyrmfire → 8 autos + Scarab Healer → Moonstone Shards

### Phase 3 (start: 300k/player)
3 autos → Scarab Healer (+ autos continue) → 3 autos → Moonstone shards → 2 autos → Soul Bomb → 1 auto + bomb hit (in that order) → 1 auto → Wyrmfire → 7 autos + Scarab Healer → Wyrmfire

.
### __Vermyx Mechanics__
### Moonstone shards
Vermyx will shout `Snaaaarl!` then the following pop-up will appear: `Shards of moonstone mark your feet. Prepare to move!` sprouting moonstone shards (10.5k LP)
⬥ 2 appear per player
⬥ Hits 4k typeless if not evaded
    • Binds, stuns, and disables protection prayers for 2 seconds
⬥ Second shard location is aimed 1t after first (1-2 squares from first)
    • Blocks movement, line-of-sight, and persists through the remainder of the fight
⬥ To deal with this mechanic, move out of the way of the light blue sections which will appear underneath you
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/L7ucraCzQO.mp4

.
### Soul Rush
⬥ Vermyx will shout `Rarghh!` then the following popup will appear: `Vermyx channels power from the Sanctum towards the west/east.`
    • Green arrows will appear to indicate where to stand to redirect the soul; it will always be 3 souls per player) and the west side will always be first
    • Directly after redirecting the souls, Vermyx reappears and the next phase starts.
    • Shortly after the third set of green arrows appear, that section of the room gets Wyrmfire. An example of this mechanic can be seen [here](<https://img.pvme.io/images/KS7S2YftJk.mp4>)
⬥ To deal with this mechanic, focus on redirecting souls by standing between the green arrows
    • Coilspawns will keep respawning if you kill them and the phase will keep **repeating until [3 souls are redirected](<https://img.pvme.io/images/egjbOb6Z5w.png>) (3 per player per phase)**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/gE0dSb2yJG.mp4

.
### Wyrmfire
Vermyx stops auto-attacking and any of the heads can start using AoE breath attacks.
⬥ West and East Coilspawn use a breath attack that goes across the middle of the arena.
⬥ Vermyx, NW Coilspawn, and NE Coilspawn use a 19x19 AoE breath attack
    • After Soul Rush, Wyrmfire is guaranteed and only in:
        ⬩ [Northwest](<https://img.pvme.io/images/KS7S2YftJk.mp4>) (phase 1-2)
        ⬩ [Northeast](<https://img.pvme.io/images/aiq08Q48Mi.mp4>) (phase 2-3)
    • If not after Soul Rush, all alive heads **including Vermyx** will Wyrmfire in an unknown order
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/xkICDlIRJY.mp4

    • Moonstone obelisks face outward and can be flanked <:flank4:712073088296157185> easily.
⬥ If failed to destroy after 25s (40t), the obelisks becomes invulnerable again and Kezalam retaliates
    • A Soulfire Wave goes back and forth over the arena. This wave is **not** telegraphed
        ⬩ Deals 8k soft typeless damage. Can be safespotted behind the obelisk

### Obliterate
Nakatra says `Prepare for death…` & `Be obliterated!` before blasting you three times with a ramping <:magic:689504724159823906> hit.
⬥ How to deal with it:
    • <:deflectmage:544195487926845462> + <:devo:513190158728953857> or <:reflect:535541258786177064> / <:debil:535541278264393729> / <:shielddome:537341954392850442> → <:res:535541258844635148>
    • Damage-forward option: <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> + <:reflect:535541258786177064> → <:reprisal:513190159462694912> + <:vitality:654618235097972737> → <:res:535541258844635148>
        ⬩ <:res:535541258844635148> / <:divert:787904334377648130> the **second** hit. <:divert:787904334377648130> is riskier
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/Y7CzDkN4sS.mp4
.
<:reflect:535541258786177064> method example [here](<https://youtu.be/G9Nf8pPd8bQ?t=1565>)

.
### Soulfire Wave
Nakatra says `The soulfire erases all.` and two soulfire waves will run over the arena in bands (West-East or South-North), dealing high magic damage.
⬥ Position yourself between the two wave edges to step out of the way.
    • Alternatively, you can [run](<https://youtu.be/Q7BAS0xSvbw>) (or <:dive:1049378668197195808> / <:surge:535533810004262912> ) through them

.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/WYhCcEMaz6.mp4
*Soulfire Waves and Summon Scarabs*

.
### Sanctum Hieroglyphs
Nakatra shouts `Feel the power beneath your feet!` or `Face judgement foul wretch.` and she divides the arena in 3x3 sections, of which 3-8 sections are about to be blasted.
⬥ Locations are foretold by one of sixteen hieroglyphs on sides of the arena, up high. Picture them as they fall face down onto the arena. The sections that are safe are hightlighted.
    • First: west wall hieroglyph
    • Second: east wall hieroglyph
    • Third: north wall hieroglyph (P4 only)
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/eSfpTNmJac.png

.
⬥ How to handle: Stand as shown in the GIF. Northeast and Southwest are the best corners for Phases 1-2, Southwest corner is the best for phase 4.
    • One of the adjacent four sections (42/48 chance) is safe, or
    • The section diagonally across (6/48 chance) is safe: use <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:dive:1049378668197195808>
⬥ If you don't get hit, your mobility ability's ( <:dive:1049378668197195808> <:surge:535533810004262912> <:escape:535541258832052231> ) cooldowns is reset

.
### Summon Nefthys
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/ZwdqJxMIAK.png
At the start of phase 3, Nakatra shouts `Nefthys!`; summons Nefthys, the Split Soul (90k LP); and becomes immune to all damage.
⬥ Two are summoned per player, at 75% adren.
⬥ Deals melee damage in halberd-distance
⬥ When you move out of halberd-distance Nefthys howls (blue bar fills up) he takes reduced damage, go halberd-distance to stop it and reset the bar.
    • When the blue bar is full, Nakatra gains +50 stacks (line: `RAAR!`)
⬥ When their adren bar is full, the next attack disables protection prayers.

### Heal Nefthys
Nakatra says `Be healed!` or `Nefthys, be retored.` and heals all Nefthys at once for 45k LP.
⬥  This occurs roughly every 22 seconds.

### Soulfire Crosswave
Nakatra blasts the arena with an eight-pointed Soulfire crosswave from the centre while Nefthys are alive.
⬥ Nefthys and star wave [video example](<https://youtu.be/DhCuBYnVC4Q?t=660>)
.

.
### Shadowsands Devour
When all Nefthys are dead, Nakatra shouts `Suffer the full power of the Sanctum!` & `The Devourer will consume you soul!`, and you get dragged to the Shadowsands. Leave within 30 seconds or you get hard instakilled <:instakill:1104794644497309809>
⬥ Release the Soul Storm in MD (<:deflectmelee:544195488447201300> for the gorillas)
⬥ Kill the Shadowsands feline akh (22.5k LP, 2/player in solo)
⬥ **Remember the two shown hieroglyphs next to the Devourer**
    • These are personal
    • Four hieroglyphs if it's the fourth time being devoured
⬥ Recover the three soul fragments to go back

Back outside, Nakatra says `Impossible...` or `WHAT ARE YOU` & `Your death is inevitable.`Prepare for the incoming barrage
⬥ Nakatra takes reduced damage for ~10 seconds and gains +50 stacks
⬥ How to handle: Step on the hieroglyph that was not shown in the shadowsands to block the barrage
    • This is personal: Group members might have a different location!
⬥ If failed: The barrage deals heavy typeless and <:magic:689504724159823906> damage every 0.6 seconds for 1.8 seconds. Nakatra gains +10 stacks for each barrage hit.
    • How to handle: <:immort:535541258538582017>

*All possible shadowsands hieroglyphs*
⬥ [Video example of phase 4](<https://youtu.be/DhCuBYnVC4Q?t=710>)
.

.
### Sanctum Shockwave
As Nakatra shouts `You cannot stop me!`, concentric shockwaves spread from under her to the arena's edge.
⬥ This happens twice back-to-back
    • You will also get 3 autos during this mechanic.
⬥ Each blast comes in four consecutive hard typeless hits: 4-3-3-3 squares, measured from Nakatra to the edge
    • Breaks through defences and puts them on cooldown.
⬥ How to handle, two ways:
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/33wYHp0Bje.mp4
*<:escape:535541258832052231> method (more forgiving)*

.
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/1t7BkZ9xJn.mp4
.
*sectionstep method (staying in <:deathskulls:1159434663903899728> range)*
For more details there is a phase 4 video guide [here](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=304boTBWrnY>)

.
Further Notes:
⬥ Shadowsands gorilla akh do not need to be killed, but if killed they do not reappear.
⬥ P2 Scarab healers can heal Nakatra on P3. This 30k LP can be removed again to reach the cap HP
⬥ P3 Nakatra is briefly damageable (~2 GCDs) after killing the last Nefthys, the moment her adren bar is full again.
⬥ Nakatra can be flanked <:flank4:712073088296157185>
    • During Sanctum Hieroglyph, she will face in the direction of the hieroglyph (never south)
    • After Shadowsands Devour she will always face north (taking full damage for ~6 seconds)
