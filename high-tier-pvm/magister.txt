> **__Introduction__**
The Magister is a boss residing at the very end of the Sophanem Slayer Dungeon. The fight requires 115 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858><:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>.

It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a Berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> and Genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> perk effects do not work.

Each Magister kill is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!B606$, with <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C228$ of that being profit. Advanced players can get up to:
⬥ $data_pvme:Bosses!B233$ kph kph with Magic, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C233$ gp/hr.
⬥ $data_pvme:Bosses!B232$ kph kph with Melee, earning on average $data_pvme:Bosses!C232$ gp/hr.

**__General__**
⬥ Bring as many keys as you're comfortable with. When starting out you can have more food and less keys, but food should generally be removed. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance, so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended.

⬥ Additionally, a Luck of the Dwarves <:LotD:566453486913323042> is viable at Magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit.

⬥ Vital spark drop enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks <:vitalspark:656426807893032963>. It awards an additional vital spark upon receiving one as a drop, and is consumed in the process. They are obtained from Bryll Thoksdottir's reward shop for 1000 Dungeoneering tokens <:dungtoken:762960358930907156> each.

⬥ It is recommended to bring 2 Super Restores <:restore:642708657825644554>. However if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> instead.

**__Familiar Choice__**
Magister has very high defense so if undergeared, it is generally a good idea to consider using a Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388> to limit splashing. However, with T92 weapons and zerk aura <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:mani:643505153709965322> you are able to obtain essentially 100% accuracy (always slightly less due to how curse drain works) so a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls is a stronger choice. Note that although you should bring Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> when using a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, you do not want to juice them as maximizing inventory space for keys is more important than the dps juicing would achieve.

High end melee with a Vampyrism Scrimshaw can utilize a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> to achieve more passive dps than a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls. This does not work for magic and range.

.
> **__The Fight__**
.tag:fight
The Magister rotates between a set of special attacks randomly with 3 actions in between. This action counter resets back to 3 at 150k, 100k, and 50k hitpoints remaining. His actions include an auto attack, Resonance, Freedom, Siphon, and Dashing. He can do some of these actions very rapidly in succession which makes his special attack timings relatively unpredictable.

.
**__150k HP__**
The Soul Obelisk used to start the fight will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too), causing food to heal less if your level falls below that which is required by the food to heal to its full potential (Saradomin Brews <:Brew:565726489400573962> and Guthix Rests <:grest:689530593901412578> are exempt from this effect). 3 Constitution levels are lost each time the effect triggers.

This drain may be counteracted by drinking a Super Restore <:restore:642708657825644554>. Damaging this pillar will also restore your maximum HP, however this pillar should always be ignored. If you kill the Magister quickly enough, this mechanic becomes irrelevant.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/o8hitZZ.png
.
**__100k HP__**
An additional soul obelisk spawns at the south side of the room, dealing 600 damage every 5-7 seconds and raising the player's corruption level by 4%, causing player's damage dealt and taken to go up by the same percentage.

This is beneficial as the boss is very DPS focused so just ignore the obelisk. The maximum value this can reach during a fight is 50% however this resets to 25% when Magister dies (if the player was below 25% corruption it does not go up to 25%, only down).
.
.img:https://imgur.com/D3nIbDG.png
.
**__50k HP__**
The Magister goes berserk, increasing his damage output while losing some defence. Kill him off quickly before he can deal too much damage onto the player.

.
> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
__**Resonance**__
Magister will heal for the damage you would have dealt, if you spot this mechanic and you have not yet used an ability, it is best to use a bleed or a weak ability to minimise his healing. Mutated dazing shot's puncture bleed does a good job of stripping this effect off semi-consistently.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/HcUrNlA.mp4
.
**__Freedom__**
Magister cannot freedom while stunned, he will only use freedom when he is bound, including 0.6s micro-binds at the end of abilities such as impact. While he will not directly aim to clear bleeds using this, he can indirectly do so should you bind him before or during your bleed. As such you should be mindful of using ability combinations such as:
⬥ <:dismember:535532879376023572> / <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:barge:535532853916860437>
⬥ <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>
⬥ <:comb:535533833098100745> → <:impact:535533809655873556>
.
.img:https://imgur.com/GkerL8m.mp4
.
**__Siphon__**
Magister will only use this when the player is at or above 70% adrenaline, draining some of their adrenaline.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/8h2rcWI.mp4
.
As such the player should aim to maintain a level of adrenaline below 70% during their ultimates so that they don't lose adrenaline which should have been used for critical thresholds. They should also be wary of  this mechanic just before using their ultimates as it can cause the player to be drained and accidentally drink an Adrenaline potion from 90-100% instead of inside their ultimate after being drained.

This can be avoided by delaying drinking your apot until after you know you have used your ultimate, or by using a stun such as Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>, Horror <:horror:535533833261547520> and the like before using their ultimate. These last long enough to prevent the magister from siphoning the player if they use their ultimate immediately after.

*Note: The three abilities mentioned above happen replace an auto attack and instead delay Magister's next auto attack by only 0.6s.*

.
> **__Specials__**
.tag:specs
**__Power Blast__**
The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack towards the player. This attack deals ranged damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> or by using Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>. If you are struggling for food on trips you can use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>. This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/S1fJmLr.mp4
.
**__Barge__**
This mechanic is signaled by the voice line **"You dare fight me?"** After a 1.8s delay, the Magister will barge to 1 sq south of player's location, dealing around 2300 melee damage in a 5x5 area and disabling protection prayers for a small duration.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/ier7amn.mp4
.
This can be avoided by moving out of the way, it is recommended you move North as this gives you a 1.2s time window to react, moving East or West leaves you with only 0.6s and to dodge it by running South is always an accident as you already have to be running that way when the mechanic starts. If you find this time window small, Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or simply ignoring it is an easier way of dealing with this mechanic.

⬥ Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the Barge. Melee should use Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>

⬥ Move 1 square away afterwards, as being melee distance to the boss can trigger the following mechanic.

.
**__Stand Still__**
The Magister will yell **"Stand still!"** and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a Mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and pray Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/UeOso18.mp4
.
This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using Melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well.  This mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> not an option.

*Note: This mechanic replaces the **Barge** mechanic while the player is in melee distance.*

.
**__Dashing__**
Magister will only dash away from the player during his **Stand Still** special attack. Magister will dash away from the starting pillar in a random direction up to 8 tiles if he is stood too close to it, this usually happens after he uses his **Barge**  special attack on a player stood close to the starting pillar.

The Magister can chain these actions together, even up to three in a row (although extremely rare) between special attacks and go spec to spec without any auto attacks inbetween whatsoever.

.
**__Unstable Mixture__**
A bomb will be thrown in the general vicinity of the player and will explode after the bar above it fills, dealing typeless damage in a 5x5 area, if caught in the radius this is 4000 damage to the player, 4000 damage to the magister (multiplied by vuln) and 2000 damage to the player's familiar.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/EqOep9I.mp4
.
There appear to be 3 versions of this special attack: a fast bomb, a slow bomb, and a bomb with no visible timer. Furthermore, if the player stands on the tile the bomb is about to land on, the bomb does not spawn. If you restart a kill quickly enough, a bomb from a previous kill can hit him in the next kill.

Bombs can be clicked on to kick it in the opposite direction of the player -- doing so removes the area of effect properties.

*Note: If the player is stood on top of the bomb, it will always be kicked south by default.*

.
**__Asphyxiate__**
The Magister will asphyxiate the player, doing a consistent amount of magic damage for 3 hits and healing off the base damage (Berserker <:Berserk:513190158468907012> multipliers and any mitigations are not counted, although corruption is). This ability does not stun and can be dealt with by moving or by using a melee threshold. This is 100% accurate on each hit, each hit can deal anywhere between 1500-3000 damage unmitigated however every hit deals the same amount of damage as the others.

The player should take care to not stun him during this special attack as this will cause him to resume auto-attacking as soon as the stun wears off, even in the middle of his Asphyxiate, causing unnecessary damage. If stunned by accident, the player should make an effort to chain their stuns to keep him stun locked.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/WTSVZKC.mp4
.
**__Restore Me__**
The Magister will regain several thousand lifepoints. He is much more likely to use this after falling below 50k lifepoints and it is often the first special attack he will use at that point. This can be avoided by stun-locking him, dealing damage and killing him before he gets the chance to use a special attack.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/3siuSRJ.mp4
.
Try not to burn too many thresholds for this purpose as you may end up wasting more damage in the long run than the healing you're aiming to prevent. You can also ignore this point but keep in mind it may take a bit longer than it seems to finish him off.

.
**__Minions__**
This mechanic only happens once the magister has performed a sufficient number of special attacks beforehand, it is particularly cumbersome and powerful and as such the player should aim to avoid it at all costs:

⬥ Two Soul Devourer minions will spawn using random combat styles. These have 10,000 HP and will remain until either they die or the fight ends. These deal moderate damage and it is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with ranged and magic.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4rbODea.mp4
.
⬥ To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the Magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end.

*Note: Players with consistent kill times less than 1 minute should never see this special.*

.
⬥ If the player finds they are taking too much damage, they can use a Feather of Ma'at to cleanse their corruption and gain some breathing room, this does however make the next kill or two slower, if the player has to resort to this consistently, it is recommended they practice their DPS more before continuing.

*Note: The Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s.*

.
> **__Protecting Your Familiar__**
.tag:familiars
As mentioned previously, the main recommended familiars are a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, a Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>, or a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> (high end melee only). All of these familiars have relatively low lifepoints, particularly the ancient summoning familiars, so some attention is needed in order to keep your familiar alive.

.
**__Tricks to Protect Your Familiar__**
⬥ Try to kick the Unstable Mixture at the Magister as often as you can instead of avoiding it, as this will otherwise frequently hit your familiar for 2,000 damage.
    • This means 5 Mixtures hitting your Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> during your trip will kill it, 6 Mixtures will kill your Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, and 10 will kill your Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>.

.
⬥ Avoiding kicking the bomb when the Magister is dead.
    • In the case that your familiar is stood in the direction you kick the Mixture, it can hit your familiar for 4,000 damage.

⬥ Pray at War's Altar in War's Retreat between trips to restore your familiar's hitpoints.

.
> **__Strategy__**
.tag:strats
**__General__**
⬥ Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers.
    • Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, where it may hit 20k+ in <:zerk:535532854004678657 but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> hits under Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> / Guthix Staff EoF <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> / Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> under Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as well.

.
⬥ Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase.
    • This only really applies to the Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> and Noxious longbow <:noxbow:513190159425208342> at 9 tiles when he is bound.
    • This also has the implication that he sometimes will phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of, meanING you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated.

.
⬥ For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill for the entire kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall.
    • Don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill.

⬥ If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set.

.

.tag:magic
**__Introduction__**
Magister is not immune to stuns or binds although he possesses the ability to freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> occassionally. Despite this, a player doing proper 4TAA with ice spell auto attacks <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> should be able to consider him near permanently bound for the purpose of using Bound Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658> to improve overall damage output. Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> should be optimally paired as the autocast spell; however, undergeared players may find more success with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> autocast for better sustain.

To improve at killing Magister with magic, you must look to optimize 3 things:

⬥ **Consistent Dps**
⬥ **Self-Sustain**
⬥ **Downtime between Kills**

.
These three things are interrelated and can be improved upon by looking to improve in 3 key ways:

⬥ **Improving your Consistent Dps**
    • This will also improve your ability to self-sustain as you heal more through Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>

⬥ **Learning to Efficiently Chain Kills**
    • Chaining kills is the secret reaching the top kph's with magic as it leads to higher Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> uptime and more consistent dps
    • An important aspect of chaining kills is reducing the downtime between kills as being slow will often lead to lost time in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Looting every few kills with Area Looting rather than every other kill will assist in reducing the downtime between kills
        - Recent changes allow you to keep the Area Loot interface open throughout your entire trip, allowing you to repeatedly loot from several squares away without interrupting your rotation.
        - It is recommended to turn on the Always use Loot Interface setting as the most difficult part of Area Looting is openning the interface early every trip.

⬥ **Maximizing Kills Per Trip**
    • Possibly your single biggest loss in downtime between kills is banking at Wars Retreat
        - A single tele, bank, and tele back takes around 30s.
        - Banking also resets your corruption stacks which take 3-4 kills to fully rebuild every trip.
    • Improving your self-sustain through <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and dps is essential to achieving this goal.
        - Bringing very little but strong food is the ideal.
        - At the top end, you should rarely if ever need more than Excal <:excal:641337999170207763> and a few brew doses.
        - Magister is one of the few bosses where using Super Saradomin Brews <:supersara:642708771344482314> is advised as you will at max consume 2 an hour, and they offer the security needed to avoid death if a trip goes down hill in a single inventory slot.

.
**__Ultimate Usage__**
⬥ Start with a Sunshine <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: You want to <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of Magister (1 square away), this gives you ample space to avoid the Unstable Mixture while staying in your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.*

.
⬥ Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds.  With good DPS, the ideal is to chain <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> across kills to maximize uptime, for example using <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> for the last 100k HP of kill A then the first 100k HP of kill B.
    • Until you are comfortable chaining kills try not to <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> below 60K HP.  This will ensure you maximize the value of Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>.
    • With good DPS and experience chaining kills, maximizing overall <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> uptime should be prioritized at the cost of <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> / <:limitless:641339233638023179> value.

.
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ **If using mainly <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Auto Attacks or Not using 4TAA**
    • Walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> and Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is very strong and should be utilized heavily outside of <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
    • Shock <:shock:535533809932697610> and Horror <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time.
        - <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> if you have extra adren, followed by a Bound <:wrack:856662355952795658>.

.
⬥ **If using mainly <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> Auto Attacks**
    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> allows for consistent usage of Bound <:wrack:856662355952795658> -- a 188% basic with a 3s cooldown -- to greatly increase your damage.
    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> can trigger Magister's <:freedom:535541258240786434> mechanic.
        - This is not an issue for the <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> combo; however, it will lead to Magister commonly clearing bleeds.
        - <:comb:535533833098100745> should be avoided as Magister will be consistently bound on top of the clear risk.
        - <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is still strong due to its frontloaded damage.
        - A good way to still use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is to try to pop his <:freedom:535541258240786434> immediately before using it with ability combinations such as <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>.
    • The Energising perk does not actually decrease the damage of <:wrack:856662355952795658> while providing consistent bonus adren.
        - This makes the Energising 4 perk BiS for mage Magister when utilizing <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> -- replace either Enhanced Devoted or Invigorating.
        - Energising is especially nice when siphoned at 100 adren right before activating <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as <:wrack:856662355952795658> will always generate the 10 adren lost.

.
⬥ **Using <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> Autocast and <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>**
    • Ideally use alongside <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> auto attacks
        - All <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> notes above still apply while using <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
        - If stuggling with sustain, opt for <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> auto attacks at the cost of spamming <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658>
    • Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> should be treated similarly to Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> on task
        - Look to use as soon as it is available
        - Beware of Hp thresholds and avoid using less than 10k before cap.
        - Like on task <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> is capable of early phasing when used in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

> **__Melee__ (~85 KPH)** <:melee:615612332521029632>
.tag:melee
For melee you'll have to be watching his actions closely and when you expect him to be able to spec, stall your abilities outside of MD and click back onto him once he either performs his next auto attack or does his special attack, when you click back on him to release your stalled ability, press your next ability to stack them on top of eachother, this allows you to losslessly leave melee distance. You will develop an instinct/gut feeling for this in time, however for beginners you will be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of melee distance.

.
**__Kills__**
⬥ Every other kill, Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> + Adren Pot <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack.
    • Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> bleed.

⬥ Threshold order: Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (or Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>) first, Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> second (and Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next.

.
⬥ Finish the kills with Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD.
    • If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025> or Stomp <:stomp:535532879552315412> to walk the bleed instead.

⬥ In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>/Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

.
⬥ If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for example, you can interrupt <:destroy:535532879330148352> on the 3rd hit with Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> and run outside of melee distance on the same tick.
    • Magister can attack before you get your 4th <:destroy:535532879330148352> hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area.
    • However, you can keep channeling your <:destroy:535532879330148352> through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

⬥ **Kill 3**
<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-hit) → (dw) <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → (improv, finish with 75%+ adren)

.
⬥ **Kill 4** *repeat Kill 2 rotation*

.
⬥ Repeat these four rotations for the remainder of the trip. On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, you can use <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606><:eofspec:746403211908481184> to burst the last 50k.

.
⬥ On the kills you Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, if 91%+ adren, target him, <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>. After walking Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren.
    • The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.

⬥ Dual wield Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as <:assault:535532853979512842> with 2h has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp.

⬥ Use Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips.

⬥ Walk Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025>.

.
Following these rotations, with  good perks and BiS gear, you generally won't have to worry about actual mechanics until the last 50k hp, as if done right he will either be stunned or you do quick enough damage between every 50k hp he doesn't have time to do a special attack. If you feel the phase is going slower than it should, consider running away between every ability as his stun/dash/stand still are the most annoying specials to deal with.

**__Kills__**
⬥ Start with a Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Again, depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away).*

.
⬥ Demoralise <:demoralise:535541258559553546> and Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> in tandem.
    • Sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds.

⬥ With an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> **shouldn't** be used at all in order to conserve HP. Feel free to use them otherwise.

⬥ If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, you can use its special attack in combination with Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> followed by Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> while Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> is on cooldown.
    • Hydrix bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> can be used to cover the adrenaline cost to have 100% in time for Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and these will likely proc within this time frame.
    • Onyx bolts <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> can alternatively provide healing if needed.

> **__Low Effort Ranged Strategy__ (65-80kph) (Courtesy of <@!406876547283157004>)**
.tag:hells
__**Profit**__
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> varies largely on the selling price of khopeshes and the buying price of keys, but this method will make $data_pvme:Bosses!C235$ gp/h profit on average at $data_pvme:Bosses!B235$kph.

.
__**Explanation**__
⬥ This method will require you to manually activate the obelisk with a key each kill, as well as throw a vuln bomb at the magister at the beginning of each fight.

⬥ This method has a substantially high startup cost and a moderately high upkeep cost.

⬥ Your main source of healing comes from soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> effects, so it is very important to have it activated.

.
⬥ It is preferable that you do this method on a soul devourer slayer task, as the extra damage dealt by Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> and the Genocidal perk <:genocidal:689503091539705870> is significant. However, it is perfectly fine to do off task.

⬥ At the beginning of each kill, it is important to throw a vulnerability bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> directly onto the magister (i.e. click the magister when throwing the bomb).

⬥ Due to the unpredictable and hard-hitting nature of the Magister's special attacks, eating food to survive is required at times, although this happens rarely.

.
**__Aura Choice__**
Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:

⬥ **Reckless Aura** <:reckless:643505179378974748> is the best aura to use, as this method suffers with accuracy issues due to magister being a boss with high defence.

⬥ **T4 Sharpshooter Aura** <:sharp:643505377291534366> may also be used, due to the aforementioned accuracy issues. May require a little more supervison.

*Note: All other auras are not recommended due to you otherwise having an extremely low hitchance.*

.
**__Weapon Choice__**
Weapon choice can vary, but will affect how afk/fast kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:

⬥ An **Eldritch Crossbow** <:ecb:615618531937222657> is the best weapon of choice for this method. The 2h crossbow range allows you to stand next to the obelisk, minimizing movement and inputs needed, while concistently maintaining a very low killtime.

⬥ **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> is also a good budget weapon to use due to its strong poison passive.

⬥ A **Hexhunter Bow** <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> may also be used. However this means that you will need to run back to the obelisk after each kill to activate it, and you risk getting stunned by the Magister's 'Stand Still' mechanic. This method has higher kph than wyvern, but is less reliable on sustain.

⬥ Lower tiered weapons will not work as this method requires you to kill the Magister before he spawns his soul devourer minions.

.
**__Recommended Familiar__**
There are two familiar options for this method: **Ripper Demon** <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203> or **Shadow Nihil** <:shadownihil:854475441946230855>. Follow these guidelines to determine the better option for you:

⬥ If using **Sharpshooter** <:sharp:643505377291534366> aura instead of Reckless <:reckless:643505179378974748> aura, <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> is preferred

⬥ If using **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> + **Anguish** <:anguish:583429936665198592>, <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> is preferred

⬥ If using **Eldritch Crossbow** <:ecb:615618531937222657> or **Desolation** <:Desolation:513190159018098713>, <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls is preferred

.
__**Mandatory Requirements**__
This setup should reliably allow you to semi-afk the Magister. **However, the following need to be done or else this method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners will result in failure**:

⬥ You are standing *next to the obelisk*

⬥ Adrenaline retention <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> <:adrenurn:656426717413507074> is active if you are not activating the obelisk as soon as the previous kill ends

⬥ **Greater Ricochet** <:grico:787904334812807238> and **Salt the Wound** <:stw:535541259109138463> are unlocked

.
⬥ **Caroming 4** <:caroming4:791281588792590336> is on your weapon

⬥ **Soulsplit** <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is active

⬥ **Anguish** <:anguish:583429936665198592> or **Desolation** <:Desolation:513190159018098713> is active
    • Desolation <:Desolation:513190159018098713> is __much__ more highly recommended due to the aforementioned accuracy issues

.

__**Preset**__
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage Relic** - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an Adrenaline Urn <:adrenurn:656426717413507074>. Can be completely removed if player is doing kills back to back with minimal delay.
⬥ <:deathward:697808774068699286> **Death Ward Relic** - Highly recommended since it provides a substantial reduction to damage taken throughout the hour.
⬥ <:thermalflask:689530593796423724> **Ogre Flask (Thermal)** - Used before the hour to increase a player's total hp. Can be stacked with of bonfire boost. This helps negate the Soul Obelisk mechanic where it will activate and continuously reduce the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too).
.
⬥ <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** - Provide extra poison damage.
⬥ <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> **Spirit Weed Incense Sticks** - Used if using a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203> to increase the spec-rate of the ripper.
⬥ <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive.
.
⬥ <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** - Used to increase phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> chance from 1/18 to 1/17, greatly increasing the profit obtained.
⬥ <:GuthixBook:574290439356809216> **Book of Balance** - Decent passive pocket item, provides extra poison procs and damage when activated. A scrimshaw of cruelty <:Cruelty:513190159546712074> is also a good alternative.
⬥ <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> **Onyx Bakriminel Bolts (e)** - Used __only__ with Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>. Necessary for the healing they provide. Without them you cannot expect to survive a couple of kills in a row at best without having to bank. ~500/hr are used.
.
⬥ <:DragonstoneBakri:565726489144852511> **Dragonstone Bakriminel Bolts (e)** - Used with Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> for their extra damage.
⬥ <:restore:642708657825644554> **Super Restore Potions** - Used to restore prayer throughout the hour if on a shadow nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> or a ripper <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> without scrolls. If using a ripper <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls, replace with spiritual prayer potions <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787>.
⬥ <:bluesmallpouch:690848914676383755> **Rune Pouch** <:Airrune:536252658986647589> <:Lawrune:536252661406760970>
(Runes for Telegrab)

**__Adjusting for Better Gear__**
⬥ If using **Eldritch Crossbow** <:ecb:615618531937222657> replace enchanted onyx bakriminel bolts <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> with enchanted dragonstone bakriminel bolts <:DragonstoneBakri:565726489144852511>. Replace super restores <:restore:642708657825644554> with spiritual prayer potions <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> since you should be using a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203>.

⬥ If using **Hexhunter Bow** <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, replace ammo with araxyte arrows. Replace super restores with spiritual prayer potions since you will be using a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203>.

.
⬥ You can optimise kph by bringing more keys per trip. This can be done by:
    • Using a rune pouch <:bluesmallpouch:690848914676383755> to store telegrab runes.
    • Replacing food with keys.
    • If on a shadow nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855>, replacing super restores <:restore:642708657825644554> with a blessed flask <:blessedflask:659122178704408598>.

⬥ It is also important to note that if bringing more keys, more than one dose of weapon poison +++ <:weppoison:689525476158472288> may need to be brought, as well as more super restores <:restore:642708657825644554>/spiritual prayer potions <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787>.

⬥ 18 keys/inventory is the best quantity for reaching maximum kph.
