.tag:intro
The Magister is a boss residing at the very end of the Sophanem Slayer Dungeon. The fight requires 115 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858><:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>. It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> and Genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> perk effects do not work.

**__General__**
⬥ Bring ⬅📉 as many 💯 keys as 💰🍑 you're comfortable with. When 👌💦 starting 🍆🍆 out you can 💰😡 have 👏👏 more 💹➕ food 🍔 and less keys, 🔑 but 🚼 food 😩 should 👶👌 generally 😄 be 🏿😡 removed. With 👏👈 max gear you 👈 will have 😄👏 100% 💯💯 hit 👊😤 chance, so 🔫 a ripper demon 👺👹 is 😇☺ recommended. If 🎵 you have 🈶🍴 lower 😌 tier 👑 gear, a 💦😷 nihil is recommended.

⬥ Additionally, a Luck of the Dwarves <:LotD:566453486913323042> is viable at Magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. 

⬥ Vital spark drop enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks <:vitalspark:656426807893032963>. It awards an additional vital spark upon receiving one as a drop, and is consumed in the process. They are obtained from Bryll Thoksdottir's reward shop for 1000 Dungeoneering tokens <:dungtoken:762960358930907156> each.

⬥ It is recommended to bring 2 super restores <:restore:642708657825644554>. However if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use spiritual prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> instead.

.tag:fight
The Magister rotates between 👈 a 👌👌 set 😠🥝 of 💦🗜 special ✌ attacks randomly with 3 👏😭 actions in 🚪👏 between. 👏 This action 🍆 counter resets back 📬🔙 to 3 🔀😩 at 🍪 150k, 100k, and 👏 50k hitpoints remaining. 🕵 His 👑🦊 actions ♂♂ include 😠😠 an auto 🤖🤖 attack, ⚔ resonance, freedom, siphon, and 💆👏 dashing. He 🅱 can 🍆💦 do some 🍭🐔 of 💦👏 these 🚱 actions very 🙌💎 rapidly 💨💨 in ⤵⤵ succession which ♀ makes 💘👏 his 💦 special 😂💯 attack 🤼🤼 timings relatively unpredictable.

.
**__150k HP__**
The ⭐ soul obelisk used to 🅱 start the ♀ fight 💥 will 🐼👏 activate and ➕👏 continuously reduce the 😼👏 player's 💰🤷 constitution level (and 💨👀 therefore 👉🔥 their 🍆👩 maximum lifepoints too), causing food 🍝 to heal less ➖➖ if ☔ your 👆 level 🍒🍒 falls below ⬇ that 😔😂 which 👏 is 🌸😍 required ✅📋 by 😈😀 the food 🍗🌭 to ✌😱 heal to its full 🈵 potential (Saradomin and 💦🍆 Guthix 💚 brews are 😍🔢 exempt from 👉💥 this effect). 📣 3 😭 constitution levels 📊📊 are lost each time ‼⌛ the effect 🐆📣 triggers. This 😤 drain may 💖 be 🐝 counteracted by 😈 drinking 🍺🥃 a 😜 super 😅😅 restore. Damaging this pillar will 🏿 also 🙇 restore your 😍👈 maximum HP, however 🖐🖐 this 👈 pillar should always 💯🤦 be ignored. 😒 If 👏👏 you 👇 kill the 👏♂ Magister quickly ⏰ enough, this 💯 mechanic becomes 📉 irrelevant.

.
**__100k HP__**
An 〰 additional soul obelisk spawns 🤑🤑 at 👌👏 the 👶👭 south 👇 side of 💰 the 🔭💦 room, dealing 600 damage every 😰 5-7 😱 seconds 🕚 and raising the 😈 player's 😤📅 corruption level by 😈 4%, 🍆 causing player's ♀ damage ☠ dealt and 👏 taken 😔😔 to 👉 go 🚴✅ up 🙅 by 😈 the ✊✊ same ♂♂ percentage. This 👁 is beneficial as 💎👦 the boss is very 😲 dps focused 😤😤 so 👅 just ignore the 🔯😈 obelisk. The 😜 maximum value 💵💵 this 🔜🏻 can reach during 🚣 a 👌 fight 🤜 is 50% however 🤔💯 this 🖖⁉ resets to 🎀 25% 👏👏 when Magister dies ⚰⚰ (if 🅱 the player was below ⬇😫 25% corruption it 💦💰 does 😻❓ not 🚫🌪 go 🏃 up to 🗣 25%, 👏 only down). ⬇

.
**__50k HP__**
The 🌟🏽 Magister goes 😩 berserk, increasing his 👣👀 damage ☠☄ output while 👱🕗 losing some defence. Kill him 🛐👏 off 😝 quickly ⏰⏰ before 🔙 he 👨🤖 can 💦 deal too much 🙌🌊 damage ☠ onto the ✊🕵 player. 🤷📅

.tag:mechanics
__**Resonance**__
Magister will heal for ✋🍆 the damage ☄ you would have dealt, if you 👈 spot 😂⏺ this 👈 mechanic and ➕ you 👨🌐 have 💴🈶 not 🙅 yet used 🎶 an 👹👹 ability, 👉 it 👸 is best to 👏 use ✊ a 🅰🅰 bleed or 🅱 a weak 🤒😭 ability 👉 to minimise his healing. Mutated dazing shot's 🔫😰 puncture bleed 😳 does a good 😌👌 job of 🗼💅 stripping this effect 📣 off 🎇 semi-consistently. 🤖

.
**__Freedom__**
Magister cannot 👀 freedom while 🕗 stunned, 😨 he 👨 will only 🏼 use 🖐 freedom when 🕙🍑 he 😨 is ✅ bound, including 💨💨 0.6s 🅱 micro-binds at 😠🍆 the 📅🏛 end 🏽 of 💰 abilities such 😢😲 as 🏿 impact. While he will 🙏 not 🤔😅 directly aim to 💦 clear bleeds using this, 🙋🤔 he 😩❤ can 💦 indirectly do so 💯💯 should you 😘 bind 🙌🙌 him 🔱 before ⏪ or 💁😇 during 🏃🏃 your bleed. 😳 As 🕛 such 🤤😱 you should 👍 be 🐝 mindful of using ability combinations such 😢💦 as: 👦🍑

.
**__Siphon__**
Magister will only use 👏 this 😷👏 when 😂 the 🔫 player 👨🤺 is 💦💦 at 👨 or 🚻 above 😩👆 70% adrenaline. 💉 As 😊🎨 such the 🐫 player 🤷📅 should 💦💘 aim to 💰 maintain a 👴 level 🔻 of adrenaline below 😫⬇ 70% during their 🏻 ultimates so that they don't 🚫 lose adrenaline 💉💉 which should 💘 have 👏🈶 been 🍀🏼 used 👨 for 👏 critical thresholds. They 😱👥 should 😀💘 also be wary of 🏧🤔  this mechanic just 🅾 before ⬅ using 🏻🤳 their 🏿🍷 ultimates as 💰👦 it 💯 can 💏 cause 💋😮 the player to be 👏🐝 drained 📉 and accidentally 😣😣 adrenaline 💉 pot 🍲🏿 from 🍆😮 90-100% ❌💯 instead 👽 of 💦💦 inside 👸 their ultimate after 😩👀 being 😑😑 drained. 📉 This 😤 can 💦💦 be avoided by 👀 delaying drinking 🥃🍺 your apot until 🕑 after you 😂👨 know you 👆‼ have 🍆😋 used 🎶🎶 your 💪💦 ultimate, or by using 🏻🤳 a stun such 😯 as impact, backhand, horror and 🌚💦 the like 👉 before using their ultimate. These 📄 last ⏳ long enough 💦 to prevent 🚫🚫 the 👏 magister from 💥🙃 siphoning the 😶📢 player 💰🤺 if 🚟 they use their ultimate immediately after. 👀

*Note: The three abilities mentioned above happen replace an auto attack and instead delay Magister's next auto attack by only 0.6s.*

.
**__Dashing__**
Magister will only dash ♀🌫 away 😬😱 from 🙃⛔ the 🙏👏 player 🎮😤 during 🚣🚣 his 🚹♂ "Stand Still" ⁉ special attack ⚔⚔ (detailed below). Magister will 👏🤔 dash away 🚞 from 🌎 the starting ✅🤠 pillar in 🙌👮 a 💰 random 🔀🔀 direction up 🍅👀 to ♀🌬 8 tiles if ☝ he is 🐠 stood ♂👫 too close 😍 to it, 👊 this ⁉ usually happens after 🏃 he 😋👉 uses 🆒🆒 his "Barge" (detailed below) 😫 special ✈🏽 attack on a 💯🅱 player stood 🕺 close 😜 to 👉 the 🏆❌ starting 🤠🤠 pillar.

The 👏👩 magister can chain 💎🏅 these 🥜 actions together, 👨 even 🌃💦 up 🛑 to 💦👉 three 🕛🕛 in 🕒 a row 💦 (although 😛 extremely 🏆 rare) ☯ between 🍼🖕 special 💯👩 attacks and go ➡🏃 spec to 💰🗣 spec without any auto 🤖🤖 attacks inbetween whatsoever.

.
> **__Specials__**
.tag:specs
**__Power Blast__**
The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack towards the player. This attack deals ranged damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> or by using Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>. If you are struggling for food on trips you can use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>. This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated.

.
**__Barge__**
This ☣ mechanic is signaled by the voice line 👧 **"You dare 🚫🚬 fight 👏 me?"** After 👀💯 a 🖼🍬 1.8s 🤜☠ delay, the 🚀😜 Magister will 👑 barge to 🆔💦 1 sq south 👇 of 🤔💦 player's 🤷 location, 👌 dealing around 🔄 2300 melee damage ☄☠ in 🍆 a 💰 5x5 area and disabling protection 🛡😎 prayers for 👏 a 👌🍆 small duration. This can 😫💦 be 😱☃ avoided by 🏼💕 moving out ▶🤔 of 💰💦 the 🔙 way, 😉 it 😢 is 😂😂 recommended you move 👊 north ☝ as this gives you a 😵😝 1.2s 🐁🤜 time window 🏙 to 😣👉 react, ✂ moving east or west leaves you with 👏👏 only 😬 0.6s 😊❌ and 👏🍟 to 💦🏼 dodge it ‼ by 😈😈 running 🏃 south 👇 is always an 👌🏼 accident 💩 as you already 😃 have 👏☣ to 💦🤔 be running 🏃🏃 that 🚟 way ↕ when 🍑 the 👏 mechanic starts. 🏁🏁 If 👏😳 you 🎵👉 find this 👈👇 time 🕐👋 window 💻 small, 😂😂 resonance or 💰 simply ignoring 🤐 it 🎈💦 is 💦 an 👏 easier way of 💦 dealing 👦🏾 with 👏 this 💦 mechanic.

⬥ Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the barge. Melee should use Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a scrimshaw of vampyrism.

⬥ Move 😎👊 1 square away 😱😝 afterwards, as 👍 being 🐝👏 melee distance to the 🍗😂 boss 👨 can ♂💦 trigger 😤😤 the following mechanic.

.
**__Stand Still__**
The Magister will yell **"Stand still!"** and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and pray Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. This mechanic replaces the "Barge" mechanic while the player is in melee distance. This mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes resonance not an option.

.
**__Unstable Mixture__**
A 💰 bomb will be 🐝🐝 thrown in the 👩 general ♂ vicinity of 💦👊 the 🎇👨 player and will explode after ❌👅 the 👏🕸 bar 🍻🍻 above 🔝🔝 it fills, dealing typeless damage in 🙌📥 a 👹👦 5x5 area, if caught 🔍👮 in the 👑 radius this 👏👈 is 4000 damage ☄ to ♂💦 the player, 4000 damage to 🏼💦 the 👏⏩ magister (multiplied by vuln) and 2000 😨😮 damage ☠ to 💦 the 🌈 player's ♀🎮 familiar. This can 🔫🔫 be 😳❌ clicked on 🏿🔛 to 💦 kick it in 👉 the 💰 opposite direction of 👩 the player, 😤📅 if 👀 the 💦 player is 😘💦 stood 👯 on 💯🔛 top 🔼👆 of 🤤 the bomb, it will always 👌👉 be 😐 kicked 😠 south 👇 by 🔥 default. There 💕 appear to be 💄 3 😩🏼 versions of this special 💯 attack: a 🅱 fast bomb, a 👌 slow ⏰ bomb, and 👽 a bomb 💥 with 💦 no visible timer. Furthermore, if 🤔🔎 the 👱🍒 player stands 🕴 on 🍽 the ♀👧 tile the ❄👏 bomb 💦💥 is about to 😵🏼 land 💯 on, the 👏 bomb 💣 does 🏋 not 🚫 spawn. If 👏 you 🕛☝ restart a 🐶 kill 💀 quickly enough, 👏💦 a bomb 💦💣 from 💰➡ a 💰❌ previous kill 🔫 can hit 👊 him 😝 in 😩 the next ☃ kill.

.
**__Asphyxiate__**
The Magister will asphyxiate the player, doing a 🤴 consistent amount 🔢🔢 of 💦 magic ✨ damage for 3 hits 💥 and ➕ healing off 💦 the base 👺 damage (berserker multipliers and any mitigations are not counted, although 😛😛 corruption is). 💦 This 😋 ability 👉👉 does 🏋 not 😡❌ stun and 👏 can 💸 be dealt with by 👀😈 moving or 👱 by using 📤🏻 a 👌 melee threshold. This is 100% 💯 accurate on 🔛🔛 each 👏 hit, each 👏👏 hit can ☺😧 deal anywhere between 1500-3000 damage ☄ unmitigated however 🖐 every hit deals the 👏🔭 same 💩 amount 🔢📉 of damage as 🏃 the 💰👏 others. 🙌 The player should take 👀🐤 care to 😘 not stun him during this 😠 special ✌ attack ⚔⚔ as this will 🎬 cause 🎗 him 😪🦊 to 💦😘 resume 😩 auto-attacking as 👌 soon 🔜⏰ as 💰 the 😩👏 stun wears off, 😝 even in the 👏 middle 👈👈 of 💦👀 his 👈👏 asphyxiate, causing unnecessary damage. ☠ If 💯 stunned 😨😨 by accident, the 🌎⤵ player 🤷👨 should 😫 make ♀ an ✒ effort 💯🙄 to 💰 chain ⛓ their 💴😴 stuns to 👍 keep 👌 him ✅💬 stun locked.

.
**__Restore Me__**
The Magister will 🎧 regain several 🔟♂ thousand 🌊🌊 lifepoints. He 🅱🚹 is much 🎁🎁 more likely to 👁✨ use 👏 this 👩 after 🅱👀 falling 🍂🍂 below 50k lifepoints and 🔫 it 🐐 is often 💰💰 the ⏪📐 first 🕐 special attack he 🔑👦 will 🏿👏 use 👏 at that 😐👆 point. This 💦🍆 can be 🤔🐝 avoided by 😈 stun-locking him, dealing 🚬👦 damage and 🅱😁 killing 🔪🔪 him 🦊 before 🤔😥 he 😵 gets the 👑👏 chance ♂🚫 to use ⚒😂 a special 👾 attack. ⚔ Try not to 👮⏸ burn 🔥🔥 too 😡👉 many thresholds for 🖋🙃 this purpose 😀 as 🕐👍 you 😘😭 may 🗓🏻 end 😂🍑 up wasting 🗑 more 💦🍆 damage ☄ in ⬅👏 the ☃🔍 long 🕑⌛ run ♂ than the healing you're 👨😠 aiming to prevent. 🚫 You 💦💯 can also ➕➕ ignore 🔇 this 🛏🍆 point ⬆🈯 but keep in 👇👏 mind 🍆💪 it 🍆👌 may 📅 take 👆 a 😩😱 bit longer 😒🍆 than 💉⬆ it 😍😂 seems 🔥👏 to finish 🏅 him 😪 off.

.
**__Minions__**
This mechanic only happens once 💯🏳 the magister has performed 💃 a 💰 sufficient number ☎ of 💦 special 😂👾 attacks beforehand, 😫🍑 it 😭 is 👉🔥 particularly cumbersome and 💡 powerful 🔋😈 and as 🍑🏿 such 🔝 the ⛪👧 player should 😑👶 aim to 💦💦 avoid it 😏 at all 💯💯 costs:

.
⬥ Two 💑 Soul Devourer minions will 💯🤔 spawn using 📤🏻 random 🔀 combat 🗡🗡 styles. These have 10,000 HP and 🔄👌 will remain 🔕 until 🙄 either 😗😙 they 👩 die ✖⚰ or the fight ends. ♂😤 These ❌🔫 deal moderate damage ☄☠ and it is recommended to 😳💦 kill 👻🗡 them unless 💁👏 the fight 🙀✊ is at 😂 least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with 💦💥 ranged and 👏💰 magic. ✨✨

⬥ To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. This makes dreadnips a very powerful ally, especially for players with lower DPS. The stuns they provide can also be used to boost the damage of Slice <:slice:535532879594258432>, Punish <:punish:535532879439069184>, Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> and Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> for free, and also cause you to take less damage.

*Note: Players with consistent kill times less than 1 minute should never see this special.*

.
⬥ If 🤔🤔 the player 🎮 finds they 👧 are 🏄 taking too much damage, ☄ they ✨👸 can 👍🔫 use 👏 a 💰👌 feather of 💦💦 Ma'at 💰👩 to ⚔ cleanse their corruption and 👏 gain some breathing 🐳 room, this 👇 does ✊❓ however make 🖕♀ the 😠 next 💕 kill 🔫👏 or 😇 two slower, if 👀👏 the 😎 player 🎮🤷 has 👩 to resort to 🙌💦 this 😭 consistently, it 😏 is 💦 recommended they practice 🎯🎯 their 😴🍆 DPS more 🙅🅱 before continuing.

*Note: The Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s.*

.
> **__Strategy__**
.tag:strats
**__General__**
⬥ Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, where it may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> hits under Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>/ Guthix Staff EoF <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> under Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as well. Using this to your advantage can help reduce damage lost to phase caps.

.
⬥ Magister's phasing is based 😎💰 on 🔛 him ⬆ attempting to auto 🤖 attack 🤼 or 💁 taking a 👌 hit of 💦 damage within 🅰😱 attack ⚔ range 💦💦 (which 🐱 is instead 💴💴 mitigated), as such, 😲 if 👏 you 👦😍 are outside of 🔟😰 his attack range, 🤤💦 he will not 🚫🙅 phase. This 📍👈 only 🙇😂 really 😍 applies to 👏⬆ the 👮💞 SGB and 🚙 Noxious longbow at 9 ♍🅰 tiles when 🕐 he ♂🏠 is 💰💦 bound. 🤐 This 🎁⬇ also ➕ has 👏 the 👏 implication that 🍑😐 he 👦 sometimes 🕑 will phase 🌗🌓 a 👌 few 🔢👇 ticks after 🏻 reaching 👉 his 🙏🏻 HP threshold 🤝 instead of 💦 instantly 💯💯 which is 😍 something to 🅱💦 be aware of. 💦🔍 This means 🍒😏 you 🚀 should be even more ➕ wary about using 📤 strong 😍 abilities around his 👨 HP thresholds, lest they 🙍🙋 get ♀♂ mitigated.

.
⬥ For 👀 corruption stacks, the speed ⏩⏩ of 🌈 the last ♀🕰 50k doesn't matter 🏻 as 🍑 much 🈯 on 🔛 the 👏➡ first kill, do 🍆 not 🙅 burst through 👉👉 it. This 😢👇 will 🙋⚽ allow ☁✅ you to have 👏 higher 🔝 corruption stacks for 💯 the 2nd and 3rd 👀 kill for 🎄 the entire kill, 💞 as 🏿 such 😯 you'll 👶 be doing 📌📌 more 😖➕ damage ☠☄ overall. However, 🖐🤔 don't 👎🚫 sandbag the speed ⏩⏩ of the kill. ⚰💀 You 👆 want to 🎉 kill 🔫🎺 him at 🍆😴 pace 🏿🏃 to 💦 hit 🎵👏 16-20% corruption by 😈👀 the end ♀ of the first 🔢 kill. 🚬

⬥ If 🏿❓ you're 🍆👅 getting 💦😧 fast kills, 💀 don't 🚫🚫 pick 🤗⛏ up ♂ your 👄👉 drop 🏿🏿 after 😏🏃 the kill, 🎺 pick it ♀🙅 up 👀 during your next one or 🥛💁 once every 2-3 kills ‼‼ in 📥 a 👩 set. ⚔

Magister is not immune to stuns or binds although he possesses the ability to freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> occassionally. Despite this, a player doing proper 4TAA with ice spell auto attacks <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> should be able to consider him near permanently bound for the purpose of using Bound Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> to improve overall damage output.

.
**__Ultimate Usage__**
⬥ Start with a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: You want to <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of Magister (1 square away), this gives you ample space to avoid the Unstable Mixture while staying in your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.*

.
⬥ Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds.  With good DPS, the ideal is to chain <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> across kills to maximize uptime, for example using <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> for the last 100k HP of kill A then the first 100k HP of kill B.
    • Until you are comfortable chaining kills try not to <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> below 60K HP.  This will ensure you maximize the value of Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>.
    • With good DPS and experience chaining kills, maximizing overall <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> uptime should be prioritized at the cost of <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>/<:limitless:641339233638023179> value.

.
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ If using mainly <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> auto attacks or not using 4TAA
    • Walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> and Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is very strong and should be utilized heavily outside of <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
    • Shock <:shock:535533809932697610> and Horror <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time.
        - <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> if you have extra adren, followed by a Bound <:wrack:535533809823645697>.

.
⬥ If using mainly <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> auto attacks
    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> allows for consistent usage of Bound <:wrack:535533809823645697> -- a 188% basic with a 3s cooldown -- to greatly increase your damage.
    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> can trigger Magister's <:freedom:535541258240786434> mechanic.
        - This is not an issue for the <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:535533809823645697> combo; however, it will lead to Magister commonly clearing bleeds.
        - <:comb:535533833098100745> should be avoided as Magister will be consistently bound on top of the clear risk.
        - <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is still strong due to its frontloaded damage.
        - A good way to still use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is to try to pop his <:freedom:535541258240786434> immediately before using it with ability combinations such as <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:535533809823645697> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>.
    • The Energizing perk does not actually decrease the damage of <:wrack:535533809823645697> while providing consistent bonus adren.
        - This makes the Energizing 4 perk BiS for mage Magister when utilizing <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:535533809823645697> -- replace either Enhanced Devoted or Invigorating.
        - Energizing is especially nice when siphoned at 100 adren right before activating <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as <:wrack:535533809823645697> will always generate the 10 adren lost.

For ⌛ melee you'll have 👏😤 to 💦 be watching 👀🤓 his 👃 actions ♂ closely and ➕ when you expect 🤗 him 👏😨 to ➡💦 be able to 🏻💰 spec, stall your 🔫📃 abilities outside 🕶 of 💦😫 MD and 💦 click back 📵🙄 onto him 🚦💻 once 💦 he 👑 either 😤😤 performs his 🅱😠 next auto 🤖🤖 attack or does ☝ his special attack, 🤼🤼 when 😂 you click 🖱 back 🏼💥 on him to release your stalled ability, 👉 press your 👨🍔 next 🤗 ability 👉👉 to stack 📚📚 them on 👌🔛 top 🔝 of 🔴 eachother, this 🔥 allows you ☝ to ⛪💦 losslessly leave 🏃 melee distance. You 👉 will 🅱 develop an instinct/gut feeling for 👌👨 this in ⬇🚪 time, ⏰⏱ however 💰 for 🤝🍆 beginners you 🙋 will 🐼👏 be 🙅🎄 stunned 😨😨 alot. ☹ Alternatively, use a ✝💍 scythe and ➕ stand ⛱ outside 🚭 of melee distance.

.
**__Kills__**
⬥ Every other kill, Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> + Adren Pot <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. 
    • Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> bleed.

⬥ Threshold order: Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (or Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>) first, Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> second (and Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. 

.
⬥ Finish the kills with Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. 
    • If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025> or Stomp <:stomp:535532879552315412> to walk the bleed instead.

⬥ In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>/Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

.
⬥ If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for example, you can interrupt <:destroy:535532879330148352> on the 3rd hit with Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. Magister can attack before you get your 4th <:destroy:535532879330148352> hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. However, you can keep channeling your <:destroy:535532879330148352> through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

⬥ **Kill 🔪 3** 🥜
<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-hit) → (dw) <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → (improv, finish with 75%+ adren)

.
⬥ **Kill 4** 🏳🏳 *repeat 🔂 Kill 🔫😩 2 rotation*

.
⬥ Repeat these four rotations for the remainder of the trip. On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, you can use <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606><:eofspec:746403211908481184> to burst the last 50k.

.
⬥ On the kills you Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, if 91%+ adren, target him, <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>. After walking Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren. 
    • The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.

⬥ Dual wield Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as <:assault:535532853979512842> with 2h has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp.

⬥ Use Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. 

⬥ Walk Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025>.

**__Kills__**
⬥ Start with a Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Again, depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away).*

.
⬥ Demoralise <:demoralise:535541258559553546> and Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> in tandem.
    • Sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds.

⬥ Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> should be used outside of Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> due to the 25% corruption damage bonus, as the damage is sufficiently high.

⬥ If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, you can use its special attack in combination with Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> followed by Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> while Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> is on cooldown. 
    • Hydrix bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> can be used to cover the adrenaline cost to have 100% in time for Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and these will likely proc within this time frame. Onyx bolts <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> can alternatively provide healing if needed.
