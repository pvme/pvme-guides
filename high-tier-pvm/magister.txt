> **__Introduction__**
The Magister is a boss residing at the very end of the Sophanem Slayer Dungeon. The fight requires 115 Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858><:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>.

It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a Berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> and Genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> perk effects do not work.

Each Magister kill is worth <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!B606$, with <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C228$ of that being profit. Advanced players can get up to:

**__General__**
⬥ Bring as many keys as you're comfortable with. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance, so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended.

⬥ A Luck of the Dwarves <:LotD:566453486913323042> is viable at Magister, it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, (saves ~30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh, ~10% increase in profits).

⬥ It is recommended to bring 2 Super Restores <:restore:642708657825644554>. If you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> instead.

**__Familiar Choice__**
Magister has very high defense so if undergeared, it is generally a good idea to consider using a Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388> to limit splashing. However, with T92+ weapons and zerk aura <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:mani:643505153709965322> you are able to obtain essentially 100% accuracy so a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls is a stronger choice.

High end melee with a Vampyrism Scrimshaw can utilize a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> to achieve more passive dps than a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls. This does not work for magic and range.

> **__Protecting Your Familiar__**
.tag:familiars
The main recommended familiars are a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, a Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>, or a Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> (high end melee only). All of these familiars have relatively low lifepoints, particularly the ancient summoning familiars, so some attention is needed in order to keep your familiar alive.

.
**__Tricks to Protect Your Familiar__**
⬥ Try to kick the Unstable Mixture at the Magister as often as you can instead of avoiding it, as this will otherwise frequently hit your familiar for 2,000 damage.
    • This means 5 Mixtures hitting your Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> during your trip will kill it, 6 Mixtures will kill your Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>, and 10 will kill your Nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855> <:bloodnihil:854475442169053194> <:smokenihil:854475442227642388>.

.
⬥ Avoiding kicking the bomb when the Magister is dead.
    • In the case that your familiar is stood in the direction you kick the Mixture, it can hit your familiar for 4,000 damage.

⬥ Pray at War's Altar in War's Retreat between trips to restore your familiar's hitpoints.

.
> **__Strategy__**
.tag:strats
**__General__**
⬥ Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers.
    • Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, where it may hit 20k+ in <:zerk:535532854004678657> but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> hits under Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> / Guthix Staff EoF <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> / Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> under Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as well.

.
⬥ Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase.
    • This only really applies to the Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> and Noxious longbow <:noxbow:513190159425208342> at 9 tiles when he is bound.
    • This also implies that he will sometimes phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of, meaning you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated.

.
⬥ For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill for the entire kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall.
    • Don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill.

⬥ If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set.

.tag:magic
**__Introduction__**
Magister is not immune to stuns or binds although he possesses the ability to freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> occassionally. Despite this, a player doing proper 4TAA with ice spell auto attacks <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> should be able to consider him near permanently bound for the purpose of using Bound Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658> to improve overall damage output. Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> should be optimally paired as the autocast spell; however, undergeared players may find more success with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> autocast for better sustain.

To improve at killing Magister with magic, you must look to optimize 3 things:

⬥ **Consistent Dps**
⬥ **Self-Sustain**
⬥ **Downtime between Kills**

.
These three things are interrelated and can be improved upon by looking to improve in 3 key ways:

⬥ **Improving your Consistent Dps**
    • This will also improve your ability to self-sustain as you heal more through Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>

⬥ **Learning to Efficiently Chain Kills**
    • Chaining kills is the secret reaching the top kph's with magic as it leads to higher Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> uptime and more consistent dps
    • An important aspect of chaining kills is reducing the downtime between kills as being slow will often lead to lost time in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Looting every few kills with Area Looting rather than every other kill will assist in reducing the downtime between kills
        - Recent changes allow you to keep the Area Loot interface open throughout your entire trip, allowing you to repeatedly loot from several squares away without interrupting your rotation.
        - It is recommended to turn on the Always use Loot Interface setting as the most difficult part of Area Looting is openning the interface early every trip.

⬥ **Maximizing Kills Per Trip**
    • Possibly your single biggest loss in downtime between kills is banking at Wars Retreat
        - A single tele, bank, and tele back takes around 30s.
        - Banking also resets your corruption stacks which take 3-4 kills to fully rebuild every trip.
    • Improving your self-sustain through <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and dps is essential to achieving this goal.
        - Bringing very little but strong food is the ideal.
        - At the top end, you should rarely if ever need more than Excal <:excal:641337999170207763> and a few brew doses.
        - Magister is one of the few bosses where using Super Saradomin Brews <:supersara:642708771344482314> is advised as you will at max consume 2 an hour, and they offer the security needed to avoid death if a trip goes down hill in a single inventory slot.

.
**__Ultimate Usage__**
⬥ Start with a Sunshine <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: You want to <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of Magister (1 square away), this gives you ample space to avoid the Unstable Mixture while staying in your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.*

.
⬥ Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds.  With good DPS, the ideal is to chain <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> across kills to maximize uptime, for example using <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> for the last 100k HP of kill A then the first 100k HP of kill B.
    • Until you are comfortable chaining kills try not to <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> below 60K HP.  This will ensure you maximize the value of Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> and Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>.
    • With good DPS and experience chaining kills, maximizing overall <:sunshinepf:867678154143694868> uptime should be prioritized at the cost of <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> / <:limitless:641339233638023179> value.

.
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ **If using mainly <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> Auto Attacks or Not using 4TAA**
    • Walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> and Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is very strong and should be utilized heavily outside of <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
    • Shock <:shock:535533809932697610> and Horror <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time.
        - <:horror:535533833261547520> can be used in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> if you have extra adren, followed by a Bound <:wrack:856662355952795658>.

.

    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> allows for consistent usage of Bound <:wrack:856662355952795658> -- a 188% basic with a 3s cooldown -- to greatly increase your damage.
    • <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> can trigger Magister's <:freedom:535541258240786434> mechanic.
        - This is not an issue for the <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> combo; however, it will lead to Magister commonly clearing bleeds.
        - <:comb:535533833098100745> should be avoided as Magister will be consistently bound on top of the clear risk.
        - <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is still strong due to its frontloaded damage.
        - A good way to still use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> is to try to pop his <:freedom:535541258240786434> immediately before using it with ability combinations such as <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>.
    • The Energising perk does not actually decrease the damage of <:wrack:856662355952795658> while providing consistent bonus adren.
        - This makes the Energising 4 perk BiS for mage Magister when utilizing <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658> -- replace either Enhanced Devoted or Invigorating.
        - Energising is especially nice when siphoned at 100 adren right before activating <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as <:wrack:856662355952795658> will always generate the 10 adren lost.

.
⬥ **Using <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> Autocast and <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>**
    • Ideally use alongside <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> auto attacks
        - All <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> notes above still apply while using <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
        - If stuggling with sustain, opt for <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> auto attacks at the cost of spamming <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:856662355952795658>
    • Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> should be treated similarly to Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> on task
        - Look to use as soon as it is available
        - Beware of Hp thresholds and avoid using less than 10k before cap.
        - Like on task <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> is capable of early phasing when used in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

> **__Melee__ (~85 KPH)** <:melee:615612332521029632>
.tag:melee
For melee you'll need to waytch his actions closely and when you expect him to be able to spec, stall your abilities outside of MD and click back onto him once he either performs his next auto attack or does his special attack, when you click back on him to release your stalled ability, press your next ability to stack them on top of eachother, this allows you to losslessly leave melee distance. You will develop an instinct/gut feeling for this in time, however for beginners you will be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of melee distance.

.
**__Kills__**
⬥ Every other kill, Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> + Adren Pot <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack.
    • Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>, if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> bleed.

⬥ Threshold order: Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (or Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>) first, Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> second (and Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next.

.
⬥ Finish the kills with Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD.
    • If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025> or Stomp <:stomp:535532879552315412> to walk the bleed instead.

⬥ In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>/Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

.
⬥ If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for example, you can interrupt <:destroy:535532879330148352> on the 3rd hit with Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> and run outside of melee distance on the same tick.
    • Magister can attack before you get your 4th <:destroy:535532879330148352> hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area.
    • However, you can keep channeling your <:destroy:535532879330148352> through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-hit) → (DW) <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → <:punish:535532879439069184> → (improv, finish with 75%+ adren)

.
⬥ **Kill 4** *repeat Kill 2 rotation*

.
⬥ Repeat these four rotations for the remainder of the trip. On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, you can use <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606><:eofspec:746403211908481184> to burst the last 50k.

.
⬥ On the kills you Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, if 91%+ adren, target him, <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>. After walking Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren.
    • The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.

⬥ Dual wield Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as <:assault:535532853979512842> with 2H has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp.

⬥ Use Punish <:punish:535532879439069184> as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips.

⬥ Walk Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick <:kick:535532879132885025>.

.
Following these rotations, with  good perks and BiS gear, you generally won't have to worry about actual mechanics until the last 50k hp, as if done right he will either be stunned or you do quick enough damage between every 50k hp he doesn't have time to do a special attack. If you feel the phase is going slower than it should, consider running away between every ability as his stun/dash/stand still are the most annoying specials to deal with.

**__Kills__**
⬥ Start with a Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> every kill. Again, depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary.

*Note: Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away).*

.
⬥ Demoralise <:demoralise:535541258559553546> and Rout <:rout:535541259268521994> should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> in tandem.
    • Sticky bombs <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds.

⬥ With an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> **shouldn't** be used at all in order to conserve HP. Feel free to use them otherwise.

⬥ If you have an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>, you can use its special attack in combination with Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> followed by Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> while Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> is on cooldown.
    • Hydrix bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> can be used to cover the adrenaline cost to have 100% in time for Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> and these will likely proc within this time frame.
    • Onyx bolts <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> can alternatively provide healing if needed.

.tag:hells
__**Profit**__
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> varies largely on the selling price of khopeshes and the buying price of keys, but this method will make $data_pvme:Bosses!C235$ gp/h profit on average at $data_pvme:Bosses!B235$kph.

.
__**Explanation**__
⬥ Requires you to manually activate the obelisk with a key each kill and throw a vuln bomb at the Magister at the beginning of each fight.
⬥ This method has a high startup cost and a moderately high upkeep cost.
⬥ Your main source of healing comes from soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>.
.
⬥ It is preferable to have a soul devourer slayer task (for Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>), but is not needed.
⬥ Due to the unpredictable and hard-hitting nature of the Magister's special attacks, eating food to survive is required at times, although this happens rarely.

.
**__Aura Choice__**
Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
⬥ **Reckless Aura** <:reckless:643505179378974748> is the best aura to use, as this method suffers with accuracy issues due to magister being a boss with high defence.
⬥ **T4 Sharpshooter Aura** <:sharp:643505377291534366> may also be used, due to the aforementioned accuracy issues. May require a little more supervison.

*Note: All other auras are not recommended due to you otherwise having an extremely low hitchance.*

.
**__Weapon Choice__**
Weapon choice can vary, but will affect how afk/fast kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
⬥ **Eldritch Crossbow** <:ecb:615618531937222657> is the best choice. The 2H crossbow range allows you to stand next to the obelisk, minimizing movement while consistently maintaining a very low killtime.
⬥ **Wyvern Crossbow** <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> is also a good budget weapon to use due to its strong poison passive.
⬥ A **Hexhunter Bow** <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> may also be used. However this means that you will need to run to the obelisk after each kill.
    • You also risk getting stunned by the Magister's 'Stand Still' mechanic.
    • This method has higher kph than wyvern, but is less reliable on sustain.
⬥ Lower tiered weapons will not work as this method requires you to kill the Magister before he spawns his soul devourer minions.

⬥ If using **Hexhunter Bow** <:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794>, replace ammo with araxyte arrows. Replace <:restore:642708657825644554> with <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> and use a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203>.
.
⬥ You can optimise kph by bringing more keys per trip. This can be done by:
    • Using a rune pouch <:bluesmallpouch:690848914676383755> to store telegrab runes.
    • Replacing food with keys.
    • If on a shadow nihil <:shadownihil:854475441946230855>, replacing super restores <:restore:642708657825644554> with a blessed flask <:blessedflask:659122178704408598>.
⬥ 18 keys/inventory is the best quantity for reaching maximum kph.

> __**Low Effort Mage Strategy (60-70kph) (Courtesy of <@!406876547283157004>)**__
.tag:hells2
__**Profit**__
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> varies largely on the selling price of khopeshes and the buying price of keys, but this method will make $data_pvme:Bosses!C235$ gp/h profit on average at $data_pvme:Bosses!B235$kph.

.
__**Explanation**__
⬥ Requires you to manually activate the obelisk with a key each kill and throw a vuln bomb at the Magister at the beginning of each fight.
⬥ This method has a high startup cost and a moderately high upkeep cost.
⬥ Your main source of healing comes from soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>.
⬥ It is preferable to have a soul devourer slayer task (for Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>), but is not needed.
⬥ Due to the unpredictable and hard-hitting nature of the Magister's special attacks, eating food to survive is required at times, although this happens rarely.

.
__**Aura Choice**__
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:mani:643505153709965322> **Maniacal Aura** is the best aura to use, as this method suffers with accuracy issues due to magister being a boss with high defence.
    • <:runic:643505377211842582> **T4 Runic Accuracy Aura** may also be used, due to the aforementioned accuracy issues. Will require more supervison.

*Note: All other auras are not recommended due to you otherwise having an extremely low hitchance.*

.
__**Weapon Choice**__
Weapon choice can vary, but will affect how afk/fast kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
⬥ **T92 dual wield** mage weapons <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> are the best options for this method.
⬥ **T90 dual wield** mage weapons <:seiswand:583429704837758997> <:seissing:583430011831189527> may also be used but will result in slightly slower kill times.
⬥ It is not recommended to go below using an **Elite seasinger kiba** <:eliteseasingerwand:581180345978716170> as your mainhand weapon.
    • If using an Elite seasinger kiba <:eliteseasingerwand:581180345978716170>, you may need to use more pieces of tank armour.
⬥ Lower tiered weapons will not work as this method requires you to kill the Magister before he spawns his soul devourer minions.

__**Preset**__
⬥ <:thermalflask:689530593796423724> **Ogre Flask (Thermal)** - Used before the hour to increase a player's total hp. Can be stacked with of bonfire boost.
    • Helps negate the Soul Obelisk mechanic where it continuously reduces the player's Constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints).
⬥ <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** - Provide extra poison damage.
⬥ <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> **Spirit Weed Incense Sticks** - if using a Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls <:ripperscroll:703581275155464203>.
⬥ <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive.
⬥ <:LotD:566453486913323042> **Luck of the Dwarves** - Used to increase phylactery <:phylactery:643166362361004042> chance from 1/18 to 1/17, greatly increasing the profit obtained.
.
⬥ <:scriptureofjas:869284342839513108> **Scripture of Jas** - Provides damage when activated. Cheap upfront costs and upkeep.
⬥ <:graspingpouchblue:892816437406728252> <:graspingpouchpink:892816437503221830> <:graspingpouchblack:892816436974735361> **Rune Pouches** - Standard grasping rune pouches for Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, Spellbook Swap <:SBS:543875425055670275> and Telekinetic Grab <:telekeneticgrab:866551637970255872>.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/8bFnOOy.png
_Note: This method is possible without any tank armour or animate dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, but this has a slightly increased risk of dying and is not recommended unless you have BiS magic gear (full elite tectonic, t92 weapons and t99 prayer). Only tank helm and boots are needed and may be downgraded as far as Ganodermic if your budget does not allow for cryptbloom._
