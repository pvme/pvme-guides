.tag:intro
Raids is 🤔 a mechanically intensive group 🅱🅱 boss that 🗝 may 🗓 seem daunting at 👨💯 first. 🕐 But, 😳🍑 when 😂 you 🏻 break 😎 it 😠 down ⬇⬇ into 👉💦 different 😡👱 pieces, it is fairly straight 🍆👏 forward. ⏭ One 😤 thing 😏👌 to note 🗒🗒 is 💦💦 that 😧🕵 Yakamaru has 💰 a unique 👌👰 mechanic that 👌☝ gives it 100% 💯💯 hit accuracy. 👌🏹 If 🚫🙄 Yaka were to 😪😣 splash, it 🤤 will 😜 deal half 😂 damage ☄ instead. 💴👍 Keeping this 👇 in 📥 mind, 😉 keeping the 🌎 appropriate 🙌 prayers 🙏🙏 up ⬆ (mage in 👻 md, ranged otherwise) is critical. During 🚣 the 😱🗺 entirety of the 👏🕵 fight 👊🤜 (including Mirage Phase), Yakamaru will add stacks 💦 towards ⛪⛪ its 👤 primary target. These stacks 💦 will 😩 allow Yakamaru to 🏼💦 deal increased ➕➕ damage to anyone ♀ with 😋 these 🖼 stacks. 💰💦 This 😕😩 mechanic can 💏 be 👦 dealt with 😏 using Freedom to 💦 halve the 🦏 number 😩📞 of stacks 💰 that you 😒🌮 have. 🙄♂ Unlike AoD, these stacks will ⚽👏 not 🚫🚫 reset your 🏼👏 defensive abilities.

> **Roles**
.tag:roles
__**North Tank**__
Also known as NT or Sand Tank. This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using <:freedom:535541258240786434>, <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using <:devo:513190158728953857>, then using <:res:535541258844635148> once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using <:freedom:535541258240786434> and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed.

.
__**Jelly Wrangler**__
This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and <:devo:513190158728953857>  is also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging.

.
__**Main Stun**__
Also known 😝👀 as MS. This ❌😰 person will stun Yakamaru during 🚣🏃 the 🙌👨 Stun pool. It 👊 is important ✅🤣 that 🍆🍜 this is 💥🤔 the ONLY 🕦 person 🗣 who 😂👏 stuns the 💬💦 pool. It 💯 is 💦 also ➕👨 important 😍 to 🤧 note that 💯 asphyxiate should 🈶 NOT ✋ be 💦 used 🚟🎶 as main stun; impact/deep impact or 🏼🅱 their ⬅💦 ranged/melee variants will be sufficient. Using stuns during 🏃🏃 this pool 🌊 will 👏 deal 1000 typeless damage to the 🤷 whole 👨👨 team 💰🏃 and drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense. If 👏 another 👯🏗 stun is 🎤 used quickly, 🆘🆘 the typeless damage can 🔫🔫 hit 👊 up ☝☝ to 💦 5000 typeless damage ☠ (in 👸🙌 conjunction to 💦💦 the 🌫👏 initial 💰 1000).
Back-up Stun: Also ➕☹ known 😝 as 🅱 BUS. 🚃 This person 🙆 is to stun Yakamaru during 🏃🚣 the Stun pool 🌊 ONLY if 👏😱 the ✂👭 MS misses their 👈👈 stun. If 😱👏 the 🌧 MS misses their 💯👈 stun, they are 💨 to call out 🌊 "stun missed", then the BUS 🚃🚃 will use a 👀 stun ability. Again, 🔄🙄 do 👉⚠ NOT ♀ use 🏾💁 asphyxiate to 👌 stun the pool. 🌊🌊

.
__**Double**__
Also 😛😨 known 💫👀 as 🍑💰 DBL. This 💻 person 🏿 will 🏾📃 act 🎭🎭 as 🍑 a 💰 poison 🤒 tank for 🏻 Stun pool. 🌊🌊 During 🏃🚣 Sand pool, 🌊 you will 💰💰 take the poison 🤒🤒 from 😮 sand (in 💦 conjunction with 😶💥 the 💵💦 PT). However, you 🤒🤷 will 💦 not ❌ run 🏃🏃 MD to Yakamaru during 🏃 Sand pool. You 😕 will 👏 tank the 😘👏 poison 🤒🤒 from 👉 this ☣☝ point ⬆ up 😍 until 🍆💦 Stun pool 🌊🌊 is defeated. 😖 It 🗻 is 🤔💦 important 🤣😍 to 👊 stand MD to Yakamaru during 🏃🏃 the 🍗 entirety of Stun pool (pray 🏼 mage) and 💰➕ to ⛪👪 keep a 🍾 high ⌨ HP level 🔥 as 👄 you will 💣 be 💄 getting 👏💦 hit 🔞 by mage hits, 💥 poison hits, and 👏 the 🎵 occasional 🅱 stun hit. 💪

.
__**CPR**__
This 🌶 person must revive the 👏💩 PT after 👀 the 👏👨 pool 🌊🌊 is 💪😧 phased. The ⛓ PT will 😛 show 👨 up 👀 on 🔛 the beach ⛱⛱ and will 🏼 have 👏💢 a 😄🅰 bar 😮🥃 over their 🅱🏿 head indicating how 🐼 long you 😰🏼 have 👏💰 to 🤸💦 revive them. 😑 If 🅱🙎 you 👍🤓 do not 🚫🚫 get 🉐 to the 👩👌 PT before 😳🔙 this 👈🚟 bar 😫 is 👏👉 depleted, 🗑 the PT will 👊 be instantly 💯💯 killed. 😵☠

.
__**Poison Tank**__
Also known 😝👁 as 🍑 PT. This person must tank the 🍃👶 poison for each 👏 pool 🌊 (except 😮😮 for 🏻 Stun). At 😩🍆 100k HP, Yakamaru will release a ⚒💋 poison to a 👌 random square and 👏👏 you 💪 will ⚽😘 have 🍆🙀 a few 🔛 seconds 😫😫 to ✡💳 be standing 🔪🏿 on this 👈👈 square. The 👏 designated tile will 🍑 be ✔🐝 at 😩 the center of 💰👏 four 👏👏 inward facing green arrows (this looks like 👏 detonate). Once you 🏻 get 🍑⏳ the 👏 confirmation message 💡 that 💦 you 🍆 have 🍆👏 received the 👉 poison, you must 🔒😡 rush into 🚟 melee distance to 🐚🏼 Yakamaru (pray 🙏 mage). Once 💦 Yakamaru hits 👊 0 ⬅ HP, you 😭 will 💰💯 be 🅱🌼 taken 🔫 to 📃 the beach (southeast area of 👱💦 the 🖖 instance) 🙄🙄 and 👏💦 the CPR will revive you. Make 🖕🏼 sure to switch 🎚💑 ranged prayer 👼🙏 here. 👳 If the poison 🤒🤒 tank misses the 👩 poison or 💯➕ is 🎤 not standing 🏿 MD as 🏿😏 the 💵 pool 🌊 dies, ⚰ the 😦🐈 entire pool 🌊 must 💯 be 🐝👏 repeated.

.
__**Stun 0**__ 🔥
Also known 👀 as 🏿 St0 or S0. This 🙋 person 💦🗣 must 🙏🙋 DPS the 🚟👏 Stun pool 🌊 during 🚣🏃 mirage. This 😍⬆ person should also ✅✅ follow 👣 the 👏💦 same rotation as 🍑🙇 St5 but 🤤 does not need 😋 to use 👏 any 💦 planks. This role 😩⚽ is 😃 optional as the NT 💧 may 🌌🤷 act 💊💊 as 🕑🖕 a 👌 St0 (this 🏻🤐 should 😀💘 only 💳 be 👄 done ♂ if 👏 you 😜👏 are very experienced). 🤳

.
__**Stun 5**__ 🔳🏻
Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, <:devo:513190158728953857> → <:enhreplen:634350450887622656> → <:onsl:513190159085207555>  on the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used).

.
__**Shark 10**__ 😰
Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> / <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> / <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn.

.
> **Mechanics**
.tag:mechanics
Yakamaru has 👏 different mechanics 💰💰 based 🍞🍞 on 🙇☝ the 🏛😜 pool 🌊🌊 he is 🔥 currently 🚟⌚ occupying (Choice 🔢 of 😩🤤 tendril, shark, sand, 👍🔥 stun, and 🚟 mid).

**__Map of Yakamaru Pools__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Ct30d18.png

.
__**Sand Pool**__ 🌊
This 🙅☝ is 😈🔮 the 🐬 northwestern pool, it 💯🔫 will 📎💣 always follow 👣👣 the shark pool 🌊🌊 unless 👏 Yakamaru dives to the 📖⛓ sand pool 🌊 first. 🏻😌 Yakamaru will 😳👏 use 👏 the 🗣👏 "Quick 📐 Sand" 🔥 special ☄😂 attack 🤼 here. 💦 During 🚣 this attack, ⚔ Yakamaru will 📎 begin 💦 burying eight random players in the 👏📢 instance 🤓💯 (or 💰💀 however 💰🖐 many are 🚟 in 😏🙅 the 😂💰 instance 💯 minus ➖➖ 2, 🍟🔥 so 🌃👅 if 8 remain, 🔕 6 will 💯 be 👬 affected). 🅱😤 The 💦👏 two ✌👬 free 🆘😔 players 💰 must 💰 click 🖱 on ➡😎 the 😩♀ other 👪 players 💰 in 👉 order to free them 🙊 from ⛔😲 being isnta-killed. If the 👏 base tank is buried, they must be 😡 freed as 🙌😰 soon ⌛🔜 as 🏿 possible. 🔝🔝 Typically, the 2 💦👑 unaffected players 🎮 should 😤💘 free 💜 the player 🤷 closest to ⏸ them 🎈 and 👏💰 then 😂🕛 immediately 🤣 free the 👏 base tank. If 🎅👏 you are 🔢🔢 affected 🅱🅱 by 👀 the special attack, 🤼⚔ your 👱 defensive abilities (except freedom and 👏 anticipation) will 🤔🎬 be 🐝🏻 put on 👇 cooldown (you can 🔫🔫 still 😻🚸 use Disruption Shield and Shield Dome). Furthermore, you 👉👆 will still be able 💪💪 to ✌💦 attack Yamaru even if 👏 you are 🔢 affected by the 🤔 Quick Sand attack. 🤼

Keeping the 💯👏 special attack ⚔⚔ in 👉🍌 mind, 💦💦 the team should be 🌈🐝 cautious with doing too 💗💗 much 🕵😍 or 💁 too 🚬 little 🐣😻 DPS around 100k HP. If Yakamaru does ❓😈 the 🖱 Quick Sand attack in 🌋 conjunction to 🔬 releasing the poison, the ☸ poison 🤒🤒 tank and 💰 double may not 🙅 be able to get the poison 🤒🤒 in time. ⏳🎃 If 🤔 Yakamaru is preparing to ✌😘 do the 👏 Quick 🍆 Sand attack 🤼 and 👏 the 💰👏 HP is 🏼🔥 slightly above 100k, the 🅾👩 team 💰 should 😑 slow down 👎 on 🔛 the 🤔 DPS. If 👏 Yakamaru is 🈶👏 close ↔ to 👁 0 😊😊 HP and 🍆 the poison 🤒 tank is 😩🈶 in position 🙏😫 to 👏 phase and Yakamaru is preparing to 📧💀 do 👏 the Quick 🚟 Sand attack, ⚔ the 🍝 team 💰 should 👑💘 either 🤷 phase ASAP or 👉💁 slow 😳😳 down. This 🎊💯 ensures the 🔚😜 CPR is free to save 📑 the 🏻💲 poison 🤒 tank from 💰 the insta-kill.

.
__**Stun Pool**__
This 👈 is 💦🤢 the northeastern pool, it will always 🕰 follow 👣👣 Sand Pool 🌊🌊 unless 🙋😩 Yakamaru dives to Stun Pool 🌊🌊 first. 🏻 During this 👈 pool, 🌊🌊 Yakamaru will not ✋ gain 🏿🏿 a 💰🚨 special attack, ⚔⚔ but 🍑 will 💍 gain a 😍🍬 special ✌✌ mechanic. This 🔴 means 🕖 that 🚟 Yakamaru's special 😂☄ attack rotation will be: 🐝🤔 4 🏽🕓 auto 🤖🤖 attacks, jellyfish, 4 💦 auto attacks, blue, repeat. 🔂🔂 The unique 👌 mechanic that 👨 Yakamaru gains 🏋💪 is 😗🔥 a ⏰💀 defensive buff. 💪 This 👇 buff 💪💪 increases 📊📄 as 🎨 the fight 👊💥 progresses to the 😩 point ⬆🈯 where Yakamaru will 💎 become 🤦 invulnerable to ✌ all 😎 attacks except 😮 to the ⤵➡ style it ❗👏 is 😳 weak 😰😰 against. 👉 Yakamaru's weakness 😳😖 is 😜👏 indicated by 💕 its helmet's color ⚪ (red 💉🍎 for 🕒👍 melee, green for 👉 ranged, blue for 🕒⌛ mage) or the text 📲📃 next ⏩ to 💦 Yakamaru's name. This 🅿 mechanic is 🎃💦 bypassed by 🏳🍂 using 🏻📤 a stun ability to 🍅 drastically lower 😎⬇ Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that 🏻 will 🔥😳 proc this ⬆😰 are: 😎 asphyxiate, deep 😝💰 impact, impact, horror, shock, 😨😨 tight 😩😢 bindings, rout, binding shot, 😱🔫 demoralise, destroy, 😱 stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and 👏 kick. 👣 Dreapnips and 🐟😩 dominion tower 🏬 gloves will 🙋 not 👏🚫 stun the 💰 pool. 🌊 Once 👆⁉ a 🅰 stun is 💦 used, Yakamaru will 🙅🤔 reflect damage to ✌ the team, the 🌌👏 damage ☠ reflected can be 🙋 anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. ☄☄ This damage scales to 🤔💦 Yakamaru's current 💰 defense. If 🤥🅱 Yakamaru has a very 👌☣ high ☣☝ defense and a stun is used, 🏭 the 😂 damage reflected 💡💡 will 🤗 be closer to 🅱💦 1000. If Yakamaru has 👏🚪 a low 🏼👏 defense or 👱🏻 was recently stunned, 😨 the 👏 damage ☠☄ will be 🌈💎 closer 😏😏 to 5000. If two ✌💘 players stun Yakamaru at 🍆💯 the 🥖 same time, 👌😵 the typeless damage ☄☄ will 💰👏 stack, 📚 meaning the team 💰💰 will instantly 🔥🔥 be 👏 hit 👊👊 for 6000 damage.

.
Once 👆 Yakamaru is 🔥💦 stunned, you 😍 should use high 🔝 hitting abilities and 🏿 thresholds like 😍♂ snapshot/wild magic/hurricane 📿 and use 👏✊ sacrifice (as it can 💰 hit up ❓✋ to 💦💦 10k during 🚣 this time). 🕐 Using soulsplit during these 🤤🚑 thresholds is 💦 also advised as it will 🐼 drastically cut down 😞👇 on 🔛🔝 food 🍽 usage if 👩 done properly.
If 😂 your 🔫💯 double has 🙏😱 done 💯✅ their role 😩 properly, 👸 you 👉🚟 do 👉👌 not 🙏 need 🏽✅ to 👀 slow down around 💰😲 100k HP as ☠ you ☝👈 will 👏👏 already have 😤☣ a poison 🤒🤒 tank ready. 😖😤
A 😧👌 fast ⌚ way 💫🤔 to ➡ do 👌 this pool 🌊 is to 🌒 have 👏🈶 everyone 🌎👯 heal to full 💯🌕 HP and 💰💰 build to full adrenaline, 💉💉 have someone stun, then 👏 use onslaught at 💦👸 the 👧 same time. If executed 😵😵 properly, this 👈🔽 will cut ✂ down on kill 🔪 time 👋 fairly noticeably.

.
__**Shark Pool**__ 🌊
This is 😳 the 🌟 western 🤠🤠 most pool, 🌊🌊 it will always follow the 💰👏 tendril pool 🌊🌊 unless 🙋😩 Yakamaru dives to shark pool 🌊🌊 first. Yakamaru will use the 💦 "Sharknado" special 💯☄ attack here. 🏿 During 🚣 this attack, 🤼 Yakamaru will 🏾📎 shroud itself in 👉😌 a ☝💊 Sharknado and, 👏 after a 👉 few attacks, will 👌 release the ➡ sharks. These sharks will 👊 land ⛰ around 😇 Yakamaru and 👏➡ at 👉😔 the 😫💩 feet of 💦 every 🏦😰 player 🎮 in the fight. ✊😠 To 👂 avoid tanking the ~2 🚗🙈 thousand+ 🌊🌊 typeless damage, ☠ you must 🏽🔒 surge/escape/bladed dive away 😬😂 from 💦 the 👌 sharks or kick them away. It 😡 is highly 🔊 recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away 🗑 as 🎨 you may 📅 kick 👣👣 a shark into 👉 the DPS pile. It is 👏🅱 very 🏽✅ important to 💦 note 🅰 that the 👨 sharks will 🅱 trail you until they land 🛬💯 on ↕ the ➡ ground, meaning ❌ that escaping too 😡📐 early 🥂🥂 will cause a shark to land 🛬 at your 🅱 feet 👣👣 and 🕋 hit you (and other 👨👪 DPS who are 👏💥 near 😯😯 you). One 😤 method of 💥 dealing 🏾 with this 😣 is having the 😈 DPS death dot next 🌨👉 to the 💰🗣 Tendril pool 🌊🌊 (southern pool) 🌊 during 🚣🏃 this 👈🕵 special 🎁 attack. 🤼⚔ Only ❤ a single 👏 shark will 🅱💧 land ⬇ next ⏩ to 😩🐚 the death dot and 😬🍑 can easily 😊 be 💪 kicked 😠😠 away. 😂 This method requires extensive communication and 📗💰 is 🤔 not 😫♀ advised.
.
Immediately after 🍊 the 🦉👏 sharks land, 💯🛬 a 😈 jellyfish will spawn (as four 👱 auto-attacks 🤖🤖 will 👌 have 🈶 passed). Since the team 💰 will 📃🎧 be 🐝 spread 🔓 out, 😐⬇ make 💵 sure 👉🏻 to 👋🙅 bind 👔 the 🤔 jellyfish so 🏽 that 👨👉 it 😠 does ❓😳 not 👏🙏 attack 🤼 the 🤓🍆 base tank or 💰🚨 the 🏅 DPS pile.

As 👦😴 poison 🤒 tank, it 🍆💦 is 🏳🤔 important ✅ to ✌ note 📋🗒 that there may 💖 be 🐝 more than one shark at 🍆🍆 your 👀 feet as 🍑 the 👧😈 poison is released. It 😩 is 💦🅱 advised to 🕵 bring bladed dive in 🕒 order to 💦😣 escape 🛫🛫 from 🍆 the ✋♂ sharks, dive to 💦 the 💰🤓 poison, 🤒🤒 then 😗👃 barge to 💦 pool 🌊 in 🔫 the 🌊👉 event that 😭 the 🍆👨 "Sharknado" special 🏽 is unleashed as 🖇 poison 🤒🤒 is 🙈 released. 👁👁

__**Tendril Pool**__ 🌊
The 🤔 southern most 💯 pool is referred to the "tendril pool". 🌊🌊 In 👏🙍 this 💧 pool, Yaka will 👏 still 🍺😻 use the 🌃 Jellyfish and 📱💦 Blue attacks, but 🍑 will 👀 also ➕ use 👎 two 🎄💏 more 🙅 mechanics. 💰 In 📥 this pool, 🌊🌊 it 💯 is 😩 imperative that 🎢 the 📖 base 😢 tank is 💦 the 👏 first 😌🔢 person who tags the 💰👮 pool, 🌊 otherwise Yakamaru may unleash a 😤 "Tendril" special ✌ attack ⚔🤼 into 👏👏 the 🎅 DPS pile that will 💦🙅 deal rapid typeless damage. ☠☄ The 👏🏻 special 🎁 attack ⚔ order ❌🤜 will always 💯 follow 👣👣 this: jellyfish, blue, 🙆♂ pool 🌊 special. ✈💅 For 😏🔢 the 🖇 southern pool, 🌊 the 😏 tendril special 👋 attack ⚔ will 🐼 be ☃🐝 the 👏 third 🤔 special. Keeping this 👅👈 in 👆 mind, 🅰 it 😼 is 😂💦 possible 🔝 to 🎶♀ use 💁 resonance on every single 👏 jellyfish spawn outside 🚭 of ☠💦 middle 🖕 pool (assuming 🤔 you 😭 tag 🔞 the 👀💡 jellyfish and Yakamaru does 🏋🚫 not 🚫❌ snipe your res) and 👏 maintain a 👌 high 📓 HP level 🆙 without 💯 eating. 🍴🍴 

The 👏👏 tank will 🎬 deal with 🐝👏 a 👌😎 tendril that 🌈😧 will 🤷⚽ shoot 🔫🍆 up from 🙃💋 the ground and 👏 deal rapid typeless damage. ☠ This ⬆ can 😬💦 be 🐝 negated by using 🏻 barricade or stepping away from the 👏 tendril.
.
The 🍆 DPS will 🍡 deal with a ↘🐝 "choke". 😜😜 This 👌😰 choke 😜 will 😠🐼 deal small 😞👌 amounts of 😤 typeless damage ☄ that 🤢😩 will 👀 affect the 😞 top 🔼🔼 5 DPSers. The 🍗✅ DPS can ♀ negate this 😂 special attack 🤼 by 🏳😈 doing 🅰😘 more 🍥 damage ☠ to Yakamaru. If the 🚟 DPS does ❓👏 not do 💯 enough damage ☠☄ to 🎯 Yakamaru during 🚣 the 🎁 special 😂😂 attack, ⚔⚔ the 🏾🍆 choke 😜 will 👊⚽ deal increasing amounts of 🌈 damage ☄☠ (up to 😤 2000). 😮 Freedom will 😛👋 not clear 🔎📝 this (defensives are reset by 😈😈 this 👩👮 special attack). ⚔⚔ If 👩👉 the 🅱🍆 poison 🤒🤒 is 😂 released when the 📲 top 5 DPSers are 👶 choked, you 👈💦 should 👍🤔 be 🐝 prepared to 👆 take 🤳👏 the poison 🤒🤒 for 💦✋ this 👉 pool 🌊🌊 and 😟 tank it. This is 🖍 more 🙅 of 👏🌹 a ⛓ courtesy towards ⛪ your 🏼 group and you ❔♀ should indicate if 👏👏 you are 🔢🔢 covering the 👏👨 role to 😯 avoid 🙅🙅 confusion. 😵

As the 👗🐆 poison tank, you 👆👊 should 💘 be 😡🐝 prepared to 👍💦 barge into Yakamaru immediately 🤣 after 🍆❌ receiving the poison 🤒 to ➡✌ avoid 🙅 the 🍃💩 possibility of being 🤗 choked outside 🔥⛈ of 🔥🔌 melee distance. Make ☝📝 sure 😋 you 👈 pray magic ✨ while 👱♀ standing 🏿🔪 in melee distance and 🔝👏 eat 😏😲 as 🍑 necessary as 👦😐 the 💞 poison will hit you for 🎅 fairly high 🏇 damage ☠☠ and ➕➕ cannot be negated by 🚟😈 venomblood or 🏻😤 antipoison.

__**Mirage Phase**__
After 👀 all 👦 4 pools have 👏 been 👦👏 completed, there will 👏🔥 be 🐝 20 🎊🎉 planks on 🔛 the 👏🐬 beach (to 💦💦 the 😞💉 southeast) and 👏🍟 a 👌 number of 🏫 jellyfish around 😇 Yakamaru. At 💦 this 🐸 point, ⬆ the 🏔 SH10 and two 👬 St5's should get 🙇 their 🍆☝ planks and 💯 position themselves 👧👧 near 😯😯 their 🍆👭 pools. The NT 🌈 and Base Tank should 👑👑 also position themselves 👨 near 😯 their pools ♂🏊 as 🅱 the 👏🏳 phase 🌓 continues. Ideally, the 🤤🎵 St5's, the 🔭👨 St0, NT, 🚿 and JW should stand 🚶 to 💦💦 the 👏👩 north of 🚋 the middle 🖕🖕 pool. The 🙊 SH10 and the ✨ free 🏻💜 DPS should stand ⛱🕺 to 😩 the 😦 west of 😱😤 the 👶👏 middle pool. 🌊🌊 The 🏠👏 base 😵🙄 tank should 🤔🤔 stand 🕴 south of 👨 the 🕵🌊 middle 🖕🖕 pool. Once 😩 the 👏👏 middle pool 🌊🌊 hits 50k HP, mirage will 💯 begin. 💦 Each 👏 pool 🌊 will 😡 only have 150k HP.
The 👑⛓ NT 🌈🚒 will tag the 👏🏼 Stun pool 🌊🌊 to 😀 draw 🔙 aggression and 💯 then 👀🙈 provoke the Sand 🔥🌵 pool, then 🙈 use devotion to ☃ negate incoming damage ☠ from 💰 both 🌜 pools. The St5's and 😫 the St0 will 🤴 use 👏 devotion, drink 👅🥛 an adrenaline 💉💉 potion 🍾 (or replenishment potion), 🍾 and 👏💦 then use onslaught. The 🎖👏 pool should close after 🍆 a 🅱🏻 few seconds. 🕚 Both 🌜🌜 St5's will click on 💰 the 🦉🐈 pool 🌊 and 👏 use 🖐👏 their 🍆 5 planks to close 🚫😜 the 🅱 pool. 🌊🌊 If 🏿👏 the pool is 👏 not closed, 🚫🚫 the 🌑😨 pool 🌊🌊 will 😳💦 respawn and must 🙋💪 be 🌈 repeated. It 😎 is important 😍 to 🍆 NOT use 👏😂 stuns on 🔛☝ this pool, as the 👏 stun mechanic will still be present. 🎀🎀

.
__**Stun Pool 🌊🌊 (Mirage)**__
The 🍩👏 NT 🌈 will 😜 tag 🔞 the 💌 Stun pool 🌊 to 😛 draw 🔙🔙 aggression and 🏻👏 then provoke the Sand pool, then use 👏 devotion to 💰➡ negate incoming damage ☠ from 😂⬅ both 🌊👬 pools. The St5's and 👏➕ the 👏 St0 will use 😂👏 devotion, drink 🍸👅 an ⬅〰 adrenaline potion 🍾 (or 💁😩 replenishment potion), and then 😱😮 use 👏😂 onslaught. The pool 🌊🌊 should close 😍 after a few seconds. 😫 Both ⬅ St5's will 👏 click 🖱 on 🔛📱 the pool 🌊 and 💨🏿 use ❌👏 their 🏼🍆 5 🍆❌ planks to 🌈🏻 close 😜😍 the pool. 🌊 If 🤷 the 🚗💦 pool is 💦👎 not 🙅 closed, 🚫 the 👏 pool 🌊🌊 will 💰💰 respawn and must 💯🔐 be 🐝 repeated. It 😶👈 is 😦 important 😍✅ to 💰 NOT 🚫💪 use 👏 stuns on 🔛♿ this 😑⬆ pool, 🌊 as 🍑😥 the stun mechanic will ⚽🙋 still 🍺😻 be present. 🎀 The 🏻 NT should 👌 then 🕛 move 😎 to ✋ the north of 💰 the Sand pool 🌊🌊 and the St5's and 🔜👏 St0 should 🈶 move 🏃♀ to 💦 Shark pool. 🌊🌊

.
__**Shark Pool**__ 🌊🌊
The 👏 SH10 should 💘 be 🌼 positioned to 🗣😓 the 👨 south of the 👏💶 pool. 🌊🌊 They 🏼 will 👏🚫 tag 🔞 the 👏💌 pool, 🌊🌊 voke, use devotion, build to 💩💦 100% 💯💯 and 👏 then 😥😮 do a DPS rotation. The 👏🏻 four free DPS should 👶 move 🏃 to 🔥 the east of the pool 🌊🌊 and 👏👏 also 😨🙇 do a 👌➡ DPS rotation. If the DPS is 🈶👏 optimal, Yakamaru will 🤤🖕 only 😤🍗 unleash two ✌ special 👩 attacks. Once 👆😩 the pool 🌊 hits 🎯💥 0 💦 HP, the SH10 will 🅱👏 use 📱💁 all 10 🔟 planks to 💦 cover the 📲 pool and then ➕ use 😎👏 freedom to 😆🌈 halve the 🅱 number 🎦😧 of 💦💦 aggression stacks 💰💦 they have. 🙀🐵 The 🔊 SH10 and 😂👏 free 🆓💰 DPS should 👑 then 😯 remain in 👏 their 👏 sunshines/death's swiftnesses and attack Tendril pool. 🌊🌊
If the 👏👽 DPS is 😤 not 🚫🖐 sufficient, the 🚑 SH10 should 💘 use 👏 resonance, freedom, then 👄🙈 rotate defensives to 👊➡ reduce incoming damage. ☄ The ✨ incoming DPS from the ❌ St5's and 🏻💦 St0 should 😑🤔 be 🐝 enough 🔛💦 and the 👏 pool 🌊🌊 should 👌 close.

.
__**Tendril Pool**__ 🌊
The 🔑 Base 🙄👺 Tank will 🅱 be 🅰🅱 south 👇 east 👉🌍 of 😤😫 the 👹👧 Tendril Pool 🌊 and 😎💰 must 👍💰 tank the 💰👏 pool 🌊 until after 😏🔜 Shark Pool is 💪 finished. 😂🔚 The special attack rotation will 😩🤔 remain 🔕 the same, meaning 😏 the 🏻💦 Base 🙄😢 Tank's rotation should remain 👀🔕 the 👏 same. 💩😯 Once 💦 Shark Pool 🌊 is closed, the 🌿 DPS will 💯👏 focus on 🚶 Tendril Pool 🌊🌊 and 🔫 it 😉 should 💦 be closed 🚫 before 🍑 anyone is choked. Once 😩🕓 the 🏞👏 pool 🌊🌊 hits 👊👊 0 ⓜ🕒 HP, the 🌈😎 DPS and 👏 Base 😢 Tank MUST 🙏 spam click 🖱🖱 on 👌💰 the pool 🌊 in 👏🔽 order 🤜 to 💦👬 add 👈 buckets 🍯 of 👨 sand 🔥⛱ and ➕💨 close 😍 the 👉💰 pool. 🌊 Every player 📅 can 🔫 only 👏😍 add 2 buckets 🍯 of 🔥👱 sand, 🔥 meaning a minimum of 5 🙋 people 😱🏿 are needed to close the pool 🌊 on 🔛🏿 the first 😢🥇 try. If 🏃🤥 the 👏 pool 🌊🌊 isn't closed 🚫🚫 in 🏠🥖 time, ☠🕐 it 👏😳 must 🙏😡 be 🅱🐝 repeated. If 👏 the 🔭 pool is repeated, the 👧😜 Base 😵 Tank must 💪 provoke the 👏💰 pool 🌊🌊 off 😩😝 the 👩 DPS or risk having 👉 a 👌🅰 tendril spawn in 🛌 the DPS pile. It ➡🍆 is 😤 important 😍😍 to ♂💦 note 🎵🗒 that 😝😐 buckets 🍯🍯 of 💦 sand 🌵🔥 added to 👵 the 👉👏 pool 🌊🌊 during 🚣 previous attempts will 👏 carry over. This means if 🤥 6 💪💪 buckets of sand 🌵🌵 are added during the first 🥇😂 attempt, only 😤😤 4 buckets 🍯 of 👉 sand 👍 are 🙏 needed to 💦 close 😍🚫 the 👏💡 pool 🌊 on the 💞 next attempt. 
Once the pool 🌊🌊 is 😧🤚 over, 🤔 everyone 👦👬 becomes DPS and moves 💃 to ✌✌ Sand 🏝⛱ pool. 🌊🌊

.
__**Sand Pool**__
The NT 🚿 will 🌳 be 🤔💚 north ☝☝ of the pool and 😤 be 🐝🐝 tanking auto attacks. Since no 🚫⛔ one else 🏿 from 👉⛔ the 👈 team 💰💰 should 💘 be 🏻 near 😯😯 the pool 🌊🌊 (until 😩🕑 Tendril is 👌 defeated), ❌ Yakamaru will 📃 not 🙅 use ✊👏 the 🏠 blue 🙆♂ special attack or the 🚽 Quick 🚟👀 Sand 👍⛱ attack. However, Jellyfish can 🤸 still 😻 spawn during 🚣 this 📣 pool 🌊🌊 and will 😩 be a 😎⏳ problem. 😥🏼 You 😤🏃 can 🔫 use 👎 stuns/binds/entangle/bolas to 🈶😛 deal with 👏🅱 Jellyfish, though 💥 your JW SHOULD be 💨 keeping those 👞 off the 😞 NT. Once 🕓 the ⤴🏿 DPS comes 💦💦 to finish 🔚 Sand ⛱⛱ pool, you 👏 need 😂 to 🚓💰 be 🐝🐝 cautious of 🚋👉 the Quick 🏻 Sand attack. ⚔🤼 If 👏🏃 your 👨 NT 💧 was rotating DPS rotations during 🏃🏃 their 🍆🏻 Barricade/Devotion, the pool 🌊🌊 should 😀 be finished quickly. When the ♀🌎 pool hits 🎯💥 0 ⬅💦 HP, the 👏 team should spam 🔁🔁 click 🖱 on 🔛🔛 the 👱 pool 🌊🌊 and 🏿✊ fill 🤤 it with 😅 10 buckets 🍯 of ☹ sand. 🔥👍 
If the team is affected 🅱🅱 by the 🚦👩 Quick 🏿🏿 Sand 🔥 attack 🤼 as 🕘👦 the pool hits 👊👊 0 ❕ HP, you ‼😵 won't 💪 be 👏🐝 able 💪💪 to 💦😊 fill 🥛🥛 the 🔵 pool 🌊🌊 with 😎⛹ 10 🔳 buckets 🍯🍯 of 💦😎 sand 🏝 and will be 🙋 forced to repeat 🔂 the pool. 🌊

.
__**Mid Pool**__
The 👏 Base Tank will 😬 tag, 🔞 provoke, then 😗 run ♂🐒 west to 💦 tank the 💦 middle 🖕 pool 🌊 after mirage. The DPS should 🅱 use 😂 thresholds and 🔙👏 dump their 🏻✉ adrenaline 💉 as the pool will 😩🤔 only have 50k HP. The JW should keep their Jellyfish away 😂 from the team during 🏃🚣 this 👈 last ♿ portion of the 👏😈 fight
.
The 👩 middle 🖕 pool will utilize the 💞 "jellyfish attack" and 👏 the "blue". It is important to note 📋 that 😳👆 Yakmaru will use four 👱 auto attacks before ⏪😂 using a 😩 special attack. ⚔⚔
The 🍁 jellyfish attack ⚔ will spawn a jellyfish in the ⏩ arena and 💦 five holes 🕳 will spawn around it. 😭😩 After 🍊🅱 a few 🔢 seconds, 🕚 the 🏳 holes 🌑 will shoot 🍆 water up 🖕⬆ and 💮😖 damage ☠☠ everyone 👉👌 standing 🏿 on them 🎏👧 for 🙃👉 about two thousand damage. This 👈 damage ☄ can be 👌🍆 negated using 🤳🏻 resonance or 💁💰 simply standing 🏿 off 📞 of them. 😋🏿 What ♂ is 💦 important 😍✅ to 🏼 note is 😬 that every 👏😤 person who 👏 "tanks" this 💯 special attack 🤼 by 👌🚗 standing on 🔛🎅 the 😈 holes 🌑🕳 will 👏 deal 10 🔟🅾 thousand damage to 🔨 the 👏🐈 jellyfish. This means that only five 🕔 people 👯😱 need to ♂ stand 🕴🕺 on ➡😛 the 🎅 holes 🌑🕳 in 👏 order to kill 🙃😩 the 🏿💻 jellyfish. An easy 👌♂ way ↕👉 to deal with this mechanic is 🐠 to use 👏 binding 🤝🤝 shot (or 🏻 entangle) on the 🖼 jellyfish, equip a shield, and use 🖐👏 resonance. You 👉👉 can 🔫🔫 switch to soulsplit and use 😂 piercing shot 🔫🔫 (or 🅱 wrack/slice) to 🔨➡ deal extra damage ☄☄ and 👏 finish 🏫 off the 👏💞 jellyfish. If 👌🅱 the mechanic is 😳 ignored 😒😒 entirely, the jellyfish will 👏✊ deal quick 🏻 melee hits 🎯🎯 to 💦 everyone around 😰 it. 💦😭

The 👉🏻 middle 🖕 pool will 👏👌 utilize the 🔭 "jellyfish attack" ⚔ and the 💋🍑 "blue". ♂ It 🔥 is ❤ important to 👌✌ note that Yakmaru will use four auto 🤖🤖 attacks before using a special ✈🎁 attack. ⚔
