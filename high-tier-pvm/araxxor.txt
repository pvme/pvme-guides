> **Introduction** 
.tag:intro
Araxxor is an araxyte spider who lives in the Araxyte lair, a cave beneath the Haunted Woods, just south of Port Phasmatys. He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base rage values is used. This includes minion spawns and its strength in general.
_ _
.
The fight is heavily influenced by the players choice. The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path becomes available. The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day.
_ _
.
Despite displaying a "None" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. Players carrying an araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. If utilizing a pheromone, take care to enter the fight wielding your primary weapon or Araxxor can inadvertently spawn as a combat style you are weak to (i.e. entering the battle with your enhanced excalibur equipped will cause Araxxor to spawn as a melee type). Araxxor cannot be hurt by familiars or dreadnips.

It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from POF; it may be obtained by keeping an elder spider along with a farm totem in each medium paddock

> **Drops**
.tag:drops
His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements.
With current prices the average Araxxor kill is `~1m` gp

⬥ <:pheromone:643122483641188372>  **Pheromone** `1/(50-[Enrage/20])`
⬥ <:spiderlegtop:643122501521768491>  **Leg piece** `1/40 (1/70 in duo)`

_ _
.
It is recommended to use melee as it will result in the smoothest and fastest kills. Range may be used when learning but using mage is always a bad idea since this will spawn the melee version of rax which applies bleeds; this makes it harder to learn and is a nuisance in general.

.
> **Presets**
.tag:presets
__**Beginner Preset**__
As a beginner range will allow to you keep your distance from Araxxor making it easier to dodge cleaves and melee hits. If you struggle with food management you may use a yak, eventually upgrading to using a nihil. The bolts equipped are Ruby bolts, but can be replaced with Dragonstone or Onyx. This is largely preference. Additionally, if desired, bolt switches can be used to scale range further in difficulty and damage.

As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use <:reckless:643505179378974748> , or your highest tier <:sharp:643505377291534366> if reckless is not available

.
__**Intermediate Preset**__
Once comfortable, it is encouraged to switch to killing Araxxor with a melee setup and a scythe. Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. Melee has higher inherent damage output than range, so the kills will become smoother. A <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> will also help you keep your life points high. It is recommended to take salves or some other method of poison prevention, as the range version will repeatedly poison you and eat away at an antipoison timer.

Once food is easier to conserve, switch from a Pack Yak to a Blood Nihil for higher accuracy. As a meleer, <:berserker:643505116347105290> should be used when possible, and your highest tier <:brawler:643505376917979138> otherwise.

.
__**Experienced Preset**__

Once more seasoned at the boss, it is recommended to start incorporating a DW/2H switching rotation with melee. This allows for very high DPS output.

A combat dummy is brought for building during the P4 transition. If you want efficient kph, use the grimoire, if you want efficient gp/hr, use vamp scrim. If choosing to use a grim it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2,3 and 4; at higher enrages it would be better to just camp the vamp scrim. Adrenaline Urn helps with keeping adrenaline high between kills. Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. Sailfish and brews should be used for panic eating. A <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> is brought for helping to AoE minions that may spawn when Path 1 is open, as well as to stay safe outside of MD on higher enrages as needed. ZGS and SGB are brought for their respective special attacks.
⬥ <:yellowpouch:690848914949144616>  **Rune Pouch** <:Bloodrune:536252658970001409> <:Astralrune:536252658961481769> <:Bodyrune:536252659301089280>

> **Mechanics**
.tag:mechanics
`Note:` Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Generally, this should be prepared for by using <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the 5th auto attack, so that the player is not pulled in by cleave or receives a long bind for coccoon. The same specials may not occur back-to-back.

__**Standing in scythe distance**__
In order to take advantage of the 2 tile range of halberds you must stand out of melee distance. This can easily be practiced anywhere, however for p4 there are some indicators which can help you.
Below is an image of "scythe range" for phase 4, with a recommended visual position.

.
And following is a clip for better visual representation
https://youtu.be/daiPvzj7J40
_ _
.
__**Cleave**__
Dealing with cleave is rather simple. If you have not used freedom or anticipate beforehand, you will be pulled in and have roughly 2 ticks to react to cleave. Simply move away from Araxxor to avoid taking damage. Cleave is particularly deadly at high enrages, as it has very high KO potential. If you are already in halberd range and have used freedom/anticipate then you can dodge it by stepping 1 square back
_ _
.
__**Cocoon**__
You will take damage for every tick you are still inside the cocoon. When wrapped in the cocoon, simply spam click to escape. The length of this special can be greatly shortened by using <:freedom:535541258240786434> or <:anti:535541306475151390> beforehand.
_ _
.
__**Web Shield**__
Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. This special is straightforward. Simply do not attack. It is also a great mechanic to heal off of with resonance, by firing an ability and using resonance to heal from it instantly e.g stalled cleave, quake, snipe. Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this
_ _
.
__**Minion Spawn**__
When path 1 is open, this special can occur on Phase 2 if Path 1 was taken, or on Phase 3/4 in general. Rax will spawn a wave of 5 minions from a wave of 20. Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a mirrorback or pulsing. 

In the first wave, it's the **third** to spawn. 
In the second wave, it's the **second** to spawn.
In the third wave, it's the **first** to spawn.
There is no special spider in the fourth wave.

Deal with this mechanic by getting off when the mirrorback spawns, and killing it. Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can be very helpful.
_ _
.
__**Egg Bomb**__
Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs, and fire a slow moving projectile at you. To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will only take 300 dmg. 2 exploded will result in 1200 dmg, 1 exploded results in 2100 dmg, and ignoring the mechanic will result in 3000 dmg. If eggs are not exploded, then they will spawn into spiders as well. The first special on phase 2 will always be egg bomb.
_ _
.
__**Instakill Spider**__
Only occurs on p2 if acid path is taken or p3 if acid path is open. Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. You will see the spider spawn and start walking towards you with a gauge above its head; its speed is variable. On p2, if you're already at the HP threshold and waiting for the phase to end, either <:cade:535541306353778689> or <:immort:535541258538582017> the spider, or <:bd:535532854281764884> away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. Since phase 3 is a damage gated phase, it's recommended to simply run away from the spider and avoid wasting adrenaline on a defensive ultimate.
_ _
.
__**Acid Spiders**__
On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn acid spiders. These can be lured to reduce the enrage of the boss by clicking on them and luring them beneath Araxxor, but are generally better off ignored. They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path.
_ _
.
__**Light Spots**__
This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.
_ _
.
> **The Fight**
.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1**__
This phase is timelocked to waiting for the web to burn down. Araxxor should be lowered to ~5k life points before the web is burned down. If doing top path you can optionally use natural instinct when the web is ~80% burnt. If doing path 2 you should use storm shards when they are off cooldown. There is not much else to this phase just dodge Araxxors specs and move to the next phase when the web burns.
_ _
.
__**Phase 2**__
`Top Path`
Optionally phase right after a spec on P1. The first special on P2 is always an egg bomb, this gives you time to dps Araxxor down. Start by using berserk, and once you have the greater barge buff, barge to rax and cleave,limitless, assault, deci, destroy, sever, surge/bd to P3. You should ideally never get a minion spawn on P2
_ _
.
`Middle Path`
During this phase Araxxor must be lured to the acid pool and allowed to absorb atleast 50% acid, the moved onto the platform inorder to degrade it. Araxxor should ideally be lured right next to the web during P1, once the web is burned down surge/bd to the ramp. Make sure to keep using storm shards and keep Araxxor in the acid pool until he has absorbed about ~54% acid. Then surge to top of the ramp and wait for the acid to degrade the platform. Use natural instinct just as the acidity level falls below 20% (assuming you moved to the ramp at the right time). Zerk just as you jump off the platform
_ _
.
`Bottom Path`
Phase 2 on bottom path is a timelocked phase where the arena is covered in darkness and you must move to the light spots to avoid taking damage. Araxxor will charge at you at a random interval; this leads to a cutscene where you must dodge his attack. The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/8XrM5tg.jpg
.
Dodging the attack correctly will damage the wall 100%, failing it results in 50% damage. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn can also help with this.

It is very beneficial to have bladed dive unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it.

Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible.
_ _
.
__**Phase 3**__
During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs.
`Path 1:` <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> <:next:536014182626099201> DPS
`Path 2:` <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:next:536014182626099201> DPS
`Path 3:` <:Berserk:513190158468907012> <:next:536014182626099201> DPS
_ _
.
__**Phase 4**__
This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both mage and range attacks along with melee if you are in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. This can be dealt with by focusing on DPSing while prayer flicking. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. 

At the start of the phase you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before she is attackable. 
An example of this can be seen here: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc

> **Solo Skipping**
.tag:soloskip
The first thing to note about solo skips is that they are not at all consistent and not an efficient way to get kills. It is however a way to get fast kills, although there is no solo timer so it is entirely for personal satisfaction.

First you must know how to stall an ability and use it on a new target. Enter the instance and place a dummy before jumping down, then start attacking it and use storm shards while out of attack range and quickly jump down. In order to keep the stalled ability and stay in combat you will want to use bladed dive when storm shards has 23-24s left on the cooldown. Then burn the web and click or target cycle Araxxor and use vulnerability. If you have done it correctly instead of vulnerability you will apply a storm shard to Araxxor. 

The reason you want to stall a storm shard before beginning the fight is that it allows you to apply a 3rd storm shard during phase 1 without wasting any time opposed to the 2 you could get normally without stalling. This is important because you want to minimize rng as much as possible while going for a solo skip and this adds roughly 5k damage to your shatter.

Next is the timing of things on phase 1. You want to use storm shards as soon as it is off cooldown in order to make sure you apply 3 without wasting any time. When the web is about 40% burnt you want to use the dragon battleaxe special attack. Build adrenaline and then use natural instinct at 80-85% on the web  and build back to 100% and zerk as p1 ends and dive into phase 2. On your way to phase 3 you want to be using defensives and your apot while surging twice during gcd towards phase 3(or dive and surge but this means you can't dive in order to enter phase 2).
_ _
.
There are 2 main rotations used for solo skips and the terrasaur maul helps with both. The first is slower but more consistent, and the second is faster but less consistent. For both however, you want to place a dummy shortly before entering the p3 area so you can barge it after phasing.

The first method you want to target Araxxor and activate assault with the maul equipped while out of range then on the tick you get within melee distance you want to switch to khopesh and destroy, cancel destroy with normal timing by shattering with maul. If it doesn't phase you may have time to use another basic, but if it doesn't phase from the basic then you have failed the skip and will have to try again on the next kill.

The second method starts out the same way by using assault on Araxxor while out of range with the maul equipped then using hurricane, followed by greater flurry with khopesh and then shattering with maul if/when Araxxor's hp gets low enough to finish the phase. 

If you successfully skip phase 3, immediately drop a dummy upon entering phase 4 and begin building. There will be a popup asking if you want to place this dummy since the one you barged previously will still be up, so make sure you quickly select "Okay" and then begin building. Use a few damaging basics on the dummy followed by 2 defensives and then barge. After barge you want to immediately auto+zgs spec Araxxi as she becomes attackable followed by assault and then destroy. After that use good abilities or ingenuity of the humans SGB spec to finish the kill.
