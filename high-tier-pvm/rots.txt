__**Preface**__:
This guide assumes you understand the basics of combat, equipment, and the Rots fight, including mechanics. If you’d like to know more about mechanics it is recommend to watch this video: <https://youtu.be/lN5vy1gEh4o>

**__IMPORTANT NOTE__**
Use this video **Solely** for explanation of mechanics. The methods are very outdated and are not optimal.

.
> __**Introduction**__:
Rots is generally done in a team size of 4 and the fight takes place in a split arena where the team is split into pairs. Each side will have 3 brothers, the order of which changes everyday. However you will spend more time running through tunnels than you will actually fighting the brothers, which is why it is important to be proficient at both dps rotations and movement abilties i.e. surge + bladed dive. This is also why having the mobile perk, double surge and bladed dive unlocked is crucial for high kph.

At Rots the meta is to AoE the brothers down as fast as possible. Most of the meta and strategy at Rots revolves around stacking and luring brothers so that they can be killed at the same time. By far the best way to do this is to have everyone use mechanised chinchompas and range, melee can be used but is a more advanced startegy.

Chinchompas make almost all abilities AoE. In general, all three brothers on a side are stacked on top of each other and then taking advantage of chins AoE to kill them all. Well-executed, this strategy should result in consistent 25-30s kills on any rotation.  Additionally, because the ability rotation is independent of the organization of the brothers, it is very consistent and easy to learn and perfect. As for melee its primary use is to deal high burst damage on K+2M sides in order to minimize karil specs as they have by far the highest KO potential.

.
> __**Presets**__
Bladed dive is critical to being able to exit tunnels efficiently and increase KPH. One important thing for ROTS is to use the Undead Slayer perk, as it will increase your DPS by a flat 7%. Undead Slayer ability, if owned and activated, will also increase your damage against ROTS by 15% for 10 seconds. It is rare to eat during kills and the majority of your food will be used while in tunnels. This negates the downsides of using sara brews + solids i.e. stat drain will be nullified by the time you are back at pads and since you are out of combat you won't lose adren from solids.

__**Melee Preset**__
Melee is only used on sides without Ahrim and its main purpose is to deal high burst damage in order to minimize Karil specs. When meleeing you want to start every kill with 100% adrenaline. You will <:zerk:535532854004678657> every single kill and in order to upkeep your adren you need to manage your adrenaline carefully. This is why you have multiple apots and dummies. As melee you will always incite

.
> __**What to do**__:
Once you know the rotation, it’s easy to apply it to the fight. Both players stand on the same square (DD or death dot) and don’t move unless necessary. Both players should activate their offensive range prayer (Anguish/Desolation or Turmoil/Malevolance) and Soul Link.  The incite should pray Protect from Melee and the DPS should pray Soul Split. The Soul Link curse splits both the damage and health healed from Soul Split between the two players. This allows the incite to stay healthy while not moving, maintaining the stack and effectiveness of chins. When there are 2 or more brothers that would be affected by chins, use chins. If you are targeting just one brother, use your dual crossbows or 2h bow.

.
> __**Positioning**__:
Where to stand is determined by the daily rotation, which changes everyday. On each side, three brothers spawn on three squares, spawning alphabetically North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil.

.
Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast Rots kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it’s ADG on one day, you wou;d only move from the starting spot if: (1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner, (2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side, (3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage.

Only move when you see one of these things happening:

.
**Dharok**: The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin.

**Guthan**: Guthan can melee spin.  Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don’t want the Incite to move at all).

**Torag**: The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin.

**Verac**: Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move.

**Ahrim**: Ahrim’s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won’t take damage.

**Karil**: Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move.  His **firespin attack** is the same as Ahrim’s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His **bomb attack** can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. His **lightning attack** should generally be tanked - just eat through it and you shouldn’t take more than 5-6k damage total unless it’s shadow realm (and you won’t ruin the stack). If you are low on food or it’s shadow realm, you need to move, and quickly.

.
> __**Particular Rotations (Credit to <@!206832972035260416> for the video guides)**__:
**Notes**
**1.** Note that the only difference between DPS and incite is the bleeds.
**2.** If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks. Also, make sure to step out from the pile in order to be in a position to flank.
**3.** Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk both frag shots.  they will need to walk under Ahrim/Karil in order to walk all three brothers’ frag shots. For example, if it’s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting.
**4.** Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target.  That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side.
**5.**If meleeing you always want to start kills at 100% adrenaline and your adrenaline boosting potions are to be used after a kill ends to get you to 100%. (If you’re at 75%+ use an <:enhreplen:634350450887622656>. If you’re at 60%-75%, use an <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>. If you’re below 60%, you want to place a dummy and build on it. Remember when doing this you can use defensives and still gain adrenaline while not next to the dummy.

.
**Ahrim + 2 Melee**:
Range: Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>/<:frag:535541273755385885> → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise

Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks.  Relure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. This is probably the second-easiest rotation of brothers behind Triple Melee. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275>

**Karil + 2 Melee**:
Range: Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise
Melee: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:cleave:535532878616985610> → (<:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:ingen:641339234111848463>) <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> → improvise

.
When K is mid, the incite for this side will start the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where Karil spawns and force him to walk out from under you both by waiting one tick before autoing. If you don’t start the fight on top of where Karil spawns, one of the brothers may end up behind you, and your chins won’t impact him.  Again, if Karil specs, start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks and relure them ASAP onto Karil when he is attackable. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=154>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=290>

If K is south, the DPS stands 1 square south of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square south of where the middle brother spaws. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=174>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=308>

If K is north, the DPS stands 1 square north of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square north of where the middle brother spawns. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=193>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=326>

.
**Triple Melee**:
Range: Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>/<:frag:535541273755385885> → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise
Melee: (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:cleave:535532878616985610> → (<:ingen:641339234111848463>) <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:quake:535532879506309150> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> → improvise

.
The 3M incite always starts the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where middle brother spawns. The DPS should take very little damage the entire fight and in turn should play a little bit riskier – e.g. never skip a tendril, reprisal Karil bombs if possible, etc. In order to prevent aggro onto the DPSer, I recommend that the incite wait until after his first bleed (Corruption Shot) to start running. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=249>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=390>

**AK (Middle)**:
Range (Incite): (<:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> + <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise
Range (DPS): (<:undeadslayer:641339922019516416>) Auto + <:bombard:535541306391265284> + <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise

With Karil as the middle brother it is possible to use the surge rotation on both west and east sides. This implies that you stand on the south most tile for east and 2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins + snipe > tend > snap. If you do not have a 9 tile range weapon you can do the intial auto + ability on the melee brother. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=209>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=342>
.
**AK (South)**:
Ranged (east): Auto → <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Activate <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> as snipe hits) → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>/<:frag:535541273755385885> → (Activate <:ingen:641339234111848463>, <:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → Improvise
If you are west then save your <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> for after Karil's first spec

If you are west there is no effcient way to DD the brothers. The current meta is to DD north of Ahrim and finish him + the melee brother by the time karil finishes his spec. When karil has finished his spec focus your damage on him. If you are on east you should use the door method. Both players stand in the western square of the doorway, wait for the brothers to come close to the doorway before starting their rotation. Both players walk one tile east in order to walk bleeds. Examples can be seen here:
East:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=231>
West:<https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=383>

> **Miscellaneous Rots Tips and Tricks**
__**1. Kill priorities**__:
Generally, the kill priority order goes Karil > Torag > Dharok > Guthan > Ahrim = Verac.
With quad chinning, the kill order is not as important as it used to be. If there is ever an opportunity to chin brothers, do so (and when chinning you cannot control, really, which brother takes the most damage). However, if brothers are not stacked for some reason (e.g running from a spec), then this order becomes important.

Karil is the highest priority target because his specs are the most dangerous and most damaging. Torag is next because his hammer spec has a lot of KO potential if it ever occurs simultaneously with any other spec (spin, bomb, lightning, etc). Dharok is next because he hits hard when low HP and can prolong a kill if he does a Give Me Everything special. Guthan is slightly less annoying than Dharok.  Ahrim and Verac do very little damage and have mundane specials, so they are last.

.
__**2. Would an activated Zamorak or Guthix god book work instead of a scrimshaw?**__:
A scrimshaw boosts your damage to all brothers for all abilities by 5%. Zamorak and Guthix god books generally increase your damage by 3.5% in a dummy test with reasonably good dpm.  So from the start, they are both inferior. Additionally, in AoE situations, book damage is split between brothers affected, so the books are even worse.
Never use an accuracy scrimshaw.

.
__**3. What is “ess”?  Should I use it?**__:
“Ess” refers to the berserker blood essence <https://runescape.wiki/w/Berserk_blood_essence>. When activated manually, it boosts your stats to very high levels if you are not using overloads. When activated after consuming a dose of supreme ranging potion (putting you at 118) <https://runescape.wiki/w/Supreme_ranging_potion>, it will boost your ranged stat to 133 at the start of the fight. Rotsers activate essence at the start of the fight because the boost is higher than the +18 that you would get with overloads.
.
There are some downsides to using essence. The first is that you must (or should) switch to a scrim afterwards. While you may mess the switch up at first (switching items and activating your scrimshaw), it is not hard to quickly master. The second downside is that the boost runs out after 20 seconds, leaving your range stat at 118 (inferior to the 130 provided by elder overloads). You also lose defense levels, but that is unnoticeable.

The tradeoff, then, is 20 seconds of +6 stats in exchange for worse damage and accuracy at the end of the fight. These differences are noticeable. While there is no hard line, if your sides are consistently between 20 and 30 seconds, you should use blood essence at the beginning of the fight.
Additionally, damage at the start of a RotS fight is very important, especially on Karil’s side. Two players essing on Karil’s side can consistently kill Karil before a spec whereas on overloads it is a little more difficult. If you’re in a position where you absolutely need to do damage or risk a reset or failed kill (e.g. your partner died so you’re soloing a full hp brother), you can re-ess your stats to 133.

In conclusion, essence is an advanced strategy that is recommended for those who are more comfortable with the boss fight.

.
__**4. How to keep track of Karil**__:
Karil is very dangerous, and many people (learners and experienced) die because they didn’t know Karil left a bomb for them in the pile.  The most consistent way to know where Karil is speccing is to watch for changes in the soul split animation. When Karil flies away to do a spec, the cloud-like animations that travel between the player and target will often track with him. By watching the clouds, you can know if and where Karil is speccing. If they suddenly fly towards somewhere on your side, he’s probably doing a firespin. If they fly towards one of the pillars on the chasm, it’s probably a lightning attack (might still be a bomb!). If they fly somewhere to the other side, you know it’s a bomb. This tip is useful for people on and opposite of Karil’s side.

.
__**5. Miscellaneous Tips**__:
**1.** One very common mistake is to get constantly dragged out of the stack by a Karil or Ahrim spec. Usually, Karil will start speccing around your tendril, and if you are targeting him when you do so, you will get dragged out of the stack and lose the damage from the tendril. To avoid this, switch targets to a melee brother after your first bleed or first needle strike.
**2.** How to handle Guthan’s spear? People used to voke Guthan so that he could pull the spear out.  Unfortunately, this ruins the stack and also aggros a brother onto the DPS (and since it was voked it won’t naturally go back to the incite).  The proper way to handle a spear is for the incite to navigate Guthan to MD of the DPS so that the spear can be pulled out immediately. The DPS also has responsibility. If the DPS is speared at the very beginning of the fight, before the incite has been forced to move, it is the DPS’s responsibility is to move themselves to MD of Guthan to pull out the spear. This shouldn’t be very difficult at the start. If the spear occurs later in the fight, when brothers and players are moving around, the DPS needs to stand still.  The incite should be trying to navigate Guthan to MD of the DPS, but this is made much more difficult and frustrating if the DPS is running around. If there is a combination of specs where the DPS foresees difficulty for the incite to run Guthan MD, they can still voke Guthan for the spear, but this should be a last resort (an example could be that Karil is bombing and Dharok is low hp. In such a situation, the incite doesn’t want to stop moving or risk getting smacked a very high hit. Additionally, it is very hard to lure Guthan because you both need to run from bombs.)
.
**3.** Here are some tips for conserving food:
a. Perfect your surges and bladed dives in the tunnels.
b. Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: <https://youtu.be/DpF579ZJP_Q>).
.
c. Be strategic about Excalibur usage e.g. if you are entering a well with 8300 lp, consider eating a fish instead of using your Excalibur, which can heal at least 4000 lp before the fight begins.
d. Activate fortitude when you activate Excalibur. You’ll heal about 30 more lp per Excalibur heal, and those extra lp will stick around after you deactivate fortitude.
e. Don’t use Excalibur before you exit a tunnel as it will cancel on your way out. Instead, Excalibur in the surface world before you reenter a tunnel.
f. If you need to, replace tendril with snapshot and snapshot with tight bindings (if flanking) or bombard.
g. Most importantly, learn to avoid special attacks and kill the brothers quickly.
