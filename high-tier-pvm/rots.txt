__**Preface**__:
This guide assumes you understand the basics of combat, equipment, and the RotS fight, including mechanics. If you’d like to know more about mechanics it is recommend to watch this video: <https://youtu.be/lN5vy1gEh4o>

**__IMPORTANT NOTE__**
Use this 💧 video 🎥 **SOLELY** for explanation of mechanics. 💰💰 The methods are 👧 very 💎☣ outdated and 💡👑 not optimal.

> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
RotS is 🔥 generally done 👌 in 💉🍌 a 🏾🅰 team size 🏻💪 of 💦 4 and ➕💛 the 💩 fight 💥💥 takes 💜💜 place 😍 in 📥 a 🍆👌 split arena where the 🏠 team 💰 is 👏☺ split 🚻 into 🚟👉 pairs. Each side ⏩♂ will 👏 have 👌➡ 3 🗣💵 brothers, 👬 the 🔊⛓ order 🤜🤜 of 👏💰 which changes 🚼 everyday. However 😐😐 you 👏 will spend 💰💸 more 🙊 time running 🏃 through 🤢👉 tunnels than 😻♀ you will actually 😠🤔 fighting the 🔥 brothers, which 🏼👌 is 😄💦 why it 😳 is 😬 important ✅😍 to be 😌 proficient at both 👏👩 dps rotations and 😤👏 movement abilties i.e. 💰 surge + bladed dive. This is 👏🙀 also ➕➕ why ⁉ having 😋👉 the 👏♀ mobile 📱📱 perk, ⏫⏫ double surge and 👏🍇 bladed dive unlocked 🔓 is crucial for 👏👀 high ☣ kph.

At 👈👸 RotS the 👅 meta is 🍆💢 to 🅱😰 AoE the 📜👏 brothers 👬👬 down ⬇🍵 as 👦 fast 🏿 as 🏿🏿 possible. 🔝 Most 😃 of 💦💦 the meta and 🏼😦 strategy revolve around stacking and ➕💰 luring the 🚟📐 brothers 👬 so 💯 that 🏻 they 🙍👥 can 💦 be 🐝🐝 killed 🔫🔫 at the same 👬😎 time. ⏰💯 By 🏼 far 🆘🌌 the 🍆🐬 best way 🔥☝ to 👅🎀 do 👀😫 this 👈💯 is 🍆 to 😂😅 have ⚠ everyone 👨👬 use mechanised chinchompas and 🏿 range, 🤤 melee can be used but 🍑 you 👎 will be 🅱 fine with 😤🙅 range assuming 🤓🤔 you ☑👧 have a Dark 🕶 bow Essence of 💦💦 Finality.

Chinchompas make 😤🙅 almost 💦▶ all abilities AoE. In 📥 general, ♂♂ all three 🏫 brothers 👬 on 🏼 a side are 😍😎 stacked on top of 🐶🌈 each 👏👋 other 🏳👊 and then ⌚ taking 😂 advantage of 🚋 chins AoE to kill 👻🚬 them all. Well-executed, 😦🤓 this 🔊 strategy should 😑 result in 👏 consistent 15-20s kills ☠ on 🔛🔛 any 🤣💦 rotation. Additionally, because 👆✅ the ability 👉👉 rotation is 🏻💪 independent 🙅 of 😜 the 👏👌 organization of 🔝👱 the 🏼 brothers, it 👎👏 is 🈁 very ✅♀ consistent and easy ❓❓ to ➡ learn 🏫 and 💃 perfect.

.tag:presets
Bladed dive is 🤔😝 critical to 🔢 being able 💪 to exit tunnels efficiently and 👈 increase 💳 KPH. One important thing 📴 for 👅🎁 RotS is to use the 🤴 Undead Slayer perk, ⏫ as 👨🕚 it 💦😍 will 🍑🅱 increase 💳💳 your DPS by ⚡ a 🏖👭 flat 7%. ❗💯 Undead Slayer 💦 ability, if ☝ owned 😵😵 and activated, will 🔥👮 also ➕ increase 💳💳 your damage ☄ against 😫🚫 the brothers 👬👬 by 15% 👩 for 10 🤑 seconds. 🕥 Trips are 🔢 generally 👀😄 ~30 📅 minutes 😤🕠 long, 🕑 it is 😨 rare ☯ to 👁 eat 🍔 during 🚣🚣 kills and 👏 the majority of 💰😫 your 😋💕 food 🍔 will 🍆 be used 🏭🎶 while 🕑🕗 in 👈 tunnels. This 😂 negates the 👏 downsides of 🚋😿 using 🏻 sara brews + solids i.e. stat drain will be ✅ nullified by the time 🕑👋 you 👏 are 🍑👴 back 😔🔙 at pads and 👏➕ since 👨 you 👏❓ are out of 🌈🚋 combat 🕰 you 👈 won't lose 😱 adrenaline from ⛔ solids.

__**Melee Preset**__
Melee may be used on sides without Ahrim to deal high burst damage in order to minimize Karil specs. When meleeing you want to start every kill with 100% adrenaline. You will <:zerk:535532854004678657> every single kill and in order to upkeep your adren you need to manage your adrenaline carefully. This is why you have multiple apots and dummies.

> __**What To Do**__
.tag:do
Once 😩🕓 you 😡 know 📚 the rotation, it’s 💯🍆 easy to apply 🤔 it 🤔😍 to 💦 the 👏🏽 fight. Both 🏿 players 📱💰 stand ♂ on the ⚕😩 same 🤢💁 square (DD or 💁 death 💀 dot) and 🙆😏 don’t 😡🚫 move 🔛♀ unless 👏👏 necessary. Both players 🎮📱 should 💘💘 activate their offensive range/melee 💦 prayer 👼 (Anguish/Desolation or 🥖💯 Turmoil/Malevolance) and 👏🙏 Soul 👼 Link. 🔗 The 🍑🏳 incite should pray 🙏 Protect 🛡 from 👉 Melee and 💰🎉 the DPS should pray Soul Split. 🚻🚻 The Soul 👻 Link 🔗 curse splits both 🌜🌜 the damage ☠ and health ⛑ healed from Soul 👻👻 Split between 🏻 the two 💑💏 players. 🎮 This 👈 allows the ❗👩 incite to 🚶💦 stay 💯 healthy 🌟 while 🕗👶 not 🚫🚫 moving, maintaining the stack 📚📚 and effectiveness of 🍒👬 chins. When 🍑🍑 there are 🏼💩 2 👀👱 or 🤔🏼 more ✋ brothers 👬👬 that would 😵 be 💎✔ affected by chins, use 😂👏 chins. If 🤷 you are targeting just one brother, use your 🅱⬇ dual 🔫🏏 crossbows or 🚋 2h bow. 🏹🏹

.
> __**Positioning**__
.tag:position
Where to stand is 😮 determined by the 🎺 daily 💰 rotation, which 👏👌 changes everyday. On 🔛 each 👏👏 side, three 💁 brothers 👬 spawn on 🏿👋 three 🕛👨 squares, spawning alphabetically North to South 👇👇 (A 🍑💰 North, ☝☝ Z 😂👌 South). They will then ⏱ aggro onto 🖥 players, 💰 and 👉⏰ the ➡❗ melee brothers 👬 will 😳😡 run 🏃 to the 🌃👏 players. ☹ Because ➡😡 the 😼💰 goal is 🔥💦 to 💦 stack 📚📚 all 💯💯 brothers 👬👬 in chin radius, the ♂💌 strategy is 😤 generally 😄 to 👂😣 stand 🚏 next ☃😽 to 👌 Ahrim or 📉 Karil and 👏 let ❌ the 🍬 melee brothers run 😭 to 😋🛏 you ❤👈 and 🅱👏 stack 📚📚 on 👋☝ top 🔼 of or 😫😇 next to Ahrim or ➕😇 Karil.

.
Because 👏 AoE and 🚫👏 stacking 🧀🐿 brothers 👬 is 💦 the 👑📐 most 🥇 important ✅ part 🖕 of getting 🙀👏 efficient 🔛🔛 and fast 🏃 kills, 😵‼ the 🤡 incite should 💘 move 👊♂ as 🙇👦 little as 🏿 possible 🔝 or 😩 else 😩♀ risk messing up 👌⬆ the stack. When 🕛🕚 you need to 🛑💦 move 🏼 is determined by 👉😡 the ⤵🍃 daily 💰📆 rotation because each brother does different 👎 special attacks. Internalize the special 👾💅 attacks below then 🍆 you ⓜ can formulate your own 😎 plan of when 😩 to ✌ move ♂♂ based 😲🏿 on 🔛 the 👌👏 daily rotation. For 👏 instance, 👉 if 🏼🏼 it’s ADG on one day, you 👧 would only 💶 move 👊 from the 👏😫 starting 🍆 spot 💗💓 if: 🏼 (1) Karil drops 😲 a 👦 bomb 💣 that 😤 could 🤷♂ damage ☠ you 👉 or 🥛🚨 your partner, 💞 (2) 💯🍆 Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin 💞💞 on 🏽 your 🏼⏰ side, (3) 💦 Ahrim specs and 🍆 becomes 📉📉 unattackable, at which 👏 point you should run 🏃 the 🌫⭐ brothers to stop taking 😂😂 damage. ☠

Only move when you 😀👈 see one ☝ of 💦😫 these things 💍 happening: 🍆👀

.
**__Dharok__**
The 👧👏 only Dharok spec that 😐 will 😜 force 🌑 you to move 👊☝ is 🕤💦 his melee spin. 🔄

.
**__Guthan__**
Guthan can 🔫🤕 melee spin. 🔄 Additionally, ➕➕ he ♂♂ can 🔫💦 spear the 🌊🤷 DPS, at 🏠😂 which 👏 point the 📺 DPS should move 🏼 to 🎉 stand 👬🏾 MD of Guthan (if 🤤 all 👉 brothers are 👏😎 stacked, as we 👨 don’t 🙈🚫 want the 💞 Incite to move 🏃😎 at 💰🌛 all). 💯

.
**__Torag__**
The 🔚 only 👏👁 Torag spec that 👎👉 will force 🏼🌕 you 😜 to move is 💦🔥 his melee spin.

.
**__Verac__**
Verac does ✊ not spin. Nothing ♂ Verac does ☝😈 should 👑👑 force 😣 you to 💳 move.

.
**__Ahrim__**
Ahrim’s firespin special ✌ attack 🤼⚔ can 👏🔫 force ♀ you to 💨💯 move, 😎😎 but 🌚 if 🤥🤔 you are 💦🐓 immediately next 📆☃ to 💦👍 the 👏 rift in the 🅱 center (as you 🤔👈 are 🍆👴 at 😩 the 🅱 start 🎮🎮 of 👪 the 👏👏 fight), 💯👊 you ☝ won’t take 🅰💨 damage. ☄

.
**__Karil__**
Karil is the 💰 most dangerous 😱🔥 brother. His 🤔 lightning, ⚡⛈ bomb, 💥 and 💦🍒 firespin attacks can all 🏞 force you 👈 to 🔢📖 move. 👊👊  His **firespin attack** is ⚠👉 the 🎁 same as 🏿 Ahrim’s - if you 🏼👉 are 🐓 next ⏩📆 to ✂ the rift, you 😨 will take 😥 no ❌♂ damage. ☠ His **bomb 💦💥 attack** can 🔫💯 force 😨♀ you 👈 to 💦♂ move 🏃 whether or not Karil is 😦 on 👏 your 👉👈 side. 🤝⏩ If 👏⚖ he is ℹ😂 on 👋 your 👉👩 side, 🚔 you 😰 should move 🏃 as 👦 soon as you 👉👈 realize he 👨 has 💰🈶 started a 🌇 bomb special 💦💦 because 🤔 he 🚫 leaves 💀 a 💰👉 bomb in his ♂ place when 🤷🍑 he 🦁👂 hops over. 💯🙊 If he 🦊 is 🈶♂ not 🏼 on 🔛🏽 your 👉 side, you 😛🙄 should 😤😀 be 🐝🎮 aware 👌👌 of 🤓💦 Karil bombing and 👨👏 move ☝ away 😜 from the 👌 bombs. 💣 Keep 🙊 in 👏 mind that 🙎😐 you 👈👈 can 👀🔫 be damaged by bombs on 🔛 the 👏 other 👪😂 side 👳 of the rift - so if he bombs while ⌛ you are 🏄🔢 still 😽 in your ♂ starting ✅🤠 position, you may 🦋 still 😽 need 💦🙅 to move away. 😬 If you are 👴♀ low 👇👇 on 🔛 food 🍕🍝 or 💰💰 it’s 💯🙅 shadow 👤👤 realm, 📯 you 👈 need to 💦 move quickly. 🆘⏰

**__Notes__**
⬥ If 🙄👦 you 💖 have 🤷🈶 an 🏿 offhand flanking you will need 👍👍 to 1 ✋ tick the 👏👺 switch 🎚💑 in order to 💦🚟 keep 💩 aftershock stacks. 💰
⬥ Because 😤 both players 💰💰 know what 😂😱 ability the other is 😀 doing at all times (at 👌 the 👨 start), 🏁 the incite should 😀💘 walk 🚶🚶 both 🌊 frag shots. 💥 They will need ♀😂 to walk 🏃 under Ahrim in 📥 order to 💦🔟 walk all three brothers’ frag shots. 💥 For 🕓 example, if 👏👏 it’s A+2M 🅱 (Ahrim plus two 👬 melee brothers), 👬 walk 🚶🚶 under ⬇⬇ Ahrim one 😥 tick after corrupting.
⬥ Make 📣👏 sure your 🏼♥ chins are 👏📉 hitting 😦😦 every 👏👏 brother. 😡 Chin abilities affect a 🍬 3x3 square centered ⛄ around 👥 your 😩👖 target. That 💦 is, 👏🙀 they 💏 will 👏🎧 hit any enemy that ☠ is on 🔛💯 or 🎡🥛 adjacent to 💦💦 the 🍃 square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers 👬👬 will ⚽ spread 🗝🍑 around you and you 😘 will need ✊📲 to 👩😯 target the 🅱🌈 center brother instead of any 💦 brother that may 🐝🗓 be 🐝🐝 on 💡 the side. 🚔👅
⬥ If meleeing you always want to start kills at 100% adrenaline and your adrenaline boosting potions are to be used after a kill ends to get you to 100%. (If you’re at 75%+ use an <:enhreplen:634350450887622656>. If you’re at 60%-75%, use an <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541>. If you’re below 60%, you want to place a dummy and build on it. Remember when doing this you can use defensives and still gain adrenaline while not next to the dummy.

**__Ahrim + 2 Melee__**

Ahrim, because his ♂ name starts with 👌😲 A, will ✊💰 always 😤 start North. ☝💈 When 🤷💕 there ❌😩 are 👏 two 🎄 melee brothers combined with 👈🅱 Ahrim, you ❌👆 should start 👣 the 🚀🔪 fight one square north 💈 of where 🏿🤷 he 🏃 spawns if you 😍😩 are the 🌊 the 🍗 west side. ➡ On east side you 🅱👦 should use 📱 the door 🚪🙊 method. If 👏🤥 Ahrim is not ♂🏻 aired and 🍆 does a ✝🦑 spec (very 💁 rare), the 👧 incite should 👫💘 start 🎮 running 🏻 the 🔯 melee brothers to 💦 stall their 😐 attacks.  Relure the brothers to 💦 Ahrim once 🏳 he ☝👨 is 🤔 done 👌👌 speccing. This is 👌🔥 probably 😻 the 💉👪 second-easiest 🅱✌ rotation of 👄💦 brothers behind ☠ Triple Melee. Examples can be seen 🉑👁 here: 😶

With Karil as the middle brother it is possible to use the surge rotation on both west and east sides. This implies that you stand on the south most tile for east and 2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins + snipe > dbow > improvise. If you do not have a 9 tile range weapon you can do the intial auto + ability on the melee brother. Examples can be seen here:

.tag:misc
**__Kill Priorities__**
Generally, 😄👀 the kill 💀 priority ⬆ order 🎁🤜 goes Karil → Torag → Dharok → Guthan → Ahrim = Verac.
With 😍💰 quad chinning, the 👏 kill order is 🤔 not 🙅🙅 as important as 🕘 it 😍 used 🏭 to 📖👉 be. 🐝👦 If there 🏪 is ever 😢 an opportunity 📊 to chin brothers, 👬 do so (and when chinning you cannot 😡⛔ control, 😕😤 really, 😕 which 🐱♀ brother 😤😤 takes 💜 the 🏥💦 most 🔝 damage). ☄☄ However, 😐🖐 if brothers 👬👬 are 🏄 not 🚫 stacked for some 🍭 reason 😰 (e.g 😨🤔 running from 💰 a 🅱💰 spec), then 😮 this ⬆🅿 order becomes important.

Karil is 🎃 the 💰👏 highest 🤑 priority ⬆⬆ target because his 💖🎀 specs are the ❌👏 most dangerous 🅿☠ and most ❄💯 damaging. Torag is 😂 next because 🎉 his hammer spec has 👏🈶 a lot ‼ of 👨 KO potential if 🤔 it 💋🕚 ever occurs simultaneously with 😣👼 any other 👳 spec (spin, 💞 bomb, 💥💣 lightning, etc). Dharok is next 🌨 because 💆💁 he 👉 hits 💥 hard 🍆😩 when low HP and 👏🅱 can 🔫 prolong a 💰 kill if he 🤠 does 😻 a 🅱 Give 🏾 Me 🅱 Everything 👐🙌 special. 👾✌ Guthan is 🔥💦 slightly less 〽 annoying 😑😠 than ⬆ Dharok. Ahrim and Verac do 💯 very 🍀😲 little 🐩 damage ☄☠ and have 👊👏 mundane specials, so 🤔💯 they 😕👀 are last.

.
**__How to Keep Track of Karil__**
Karil is 🤢 relatively dangerous, and 🏿 it 😂🏿 is 😬 possible to ⬇ die 💕 because 😜👏 you didn’t 😊 see 🚨 Karil leaving a 🌎 bomb 💦💦 in 🅱 the 👏🌀 pile. The most 😶 consistent way ↕👯 to know 🤔 where 😾🛐 Karil is speccing is 😣 to 👅 watch 👀👀 for changes 💰🚼 in the soul 👻 split 🚻🚻 animation. 🍆 When Karil flies away to 💵✌ do 😂🏻 a 🔵 spec, the 👏 cloud-like ☁ animations that 😤👨 travel 🛫🛫 between 🍼 the 😳🔚 player and 🚟👏 target will 🏼😳 often 😵 track 📡📡 with 💰😍 him. 👱👨 By 😈 watching the clouds, you can 🔫♂ know 💭 if 😂👌 and where ☝🤔 Karil is 😍🅱 speccing. If they 💥 suddenly fly 🐦🏽 towards ⛪ somewhere on 👌 your 🅱 side, 😂 he’s probably ♀ doing 😉📌 a 🎉💰 firespin. If 🎵 they 👥👫 fly towards ⛪ one ☝♿ of 😊💅 the 💰 pillars on 🔛🙏 the chasm, it’s probably 🎲 a lightning ⛈ attack ⚔ (might 🍆👀 still be 🌼➡ a 👓 bomb!). 💣 If they 👨🏾 fly somewhere to 👍 the ✋👏 other 🏾👪 side, you know it’s 🤷💩 a bomb. This 🎄 tip is 👐 useful for people 👱🙂 on 🔛 and 👏 opposite 🔄♠ of 💦🙌 Karil’s side. ☀🤷

⬥ Perfect your surges and 🙌👏 bladed dives in 😉👏 the 👆 tunnels
⬥ Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: <https://youtu.be/DpF579ZJP_Q>).
⬥ Don’t 🚫 use Excalibur before you 👈🤗 exit a 👻👉 tunnel 💕💕 as 😎 it will 😮🎬 cancel ❌ on 🔛🔛 your 🏻😍 way out. 💯🏍 Instead, 💴👍 Excalibur in 👏👏 the 🌫👏 surface world before 🍑😂 you reenter a 🃏🏭 tunnel. 💕
⬥ Activate fortitude when ⏰ you 🆒🔥 activate Excalibur. You’ll heal about 🏽💦 30 🚹✈ more lp per 👼👼 Excalibur heal, and those 😍 extra lp will 😘👏 stick 💦 around 👅🔃 after ❌👅 you deactivate fortitude.
⬥ Most ☺🤚 importantly, learn 📚 to ⚔💦 avoid special 👋 attacks and kill the 👏 brothers 👬👬 quickly. 🆘
