Telos, the 👏🔝 Warden is 🅱😇 the 🌊 true guardian of 👅 the 👧 Heart ❤ of 🚋🔥 Gielinor. Telos is a solo 👆👆 boss that can 🔫 only be 😡 fought after ⏳⏳ obtaining the 👊 four 👏🏼 parts of 💦🍆 an 🤗 ancient 🎶 sigil from the 🍫🌎 four 👏♂ other bosses in 🙏📥 the 🙊💞 Heart (requiring 80 attack, 🤼⚔ prayer, magic, and range). 💦🤤 Telos is 💦💦 regarded as the 🚪 most 🦊😤 profitable boss currently ⌚🚟 once a 🏆👌 player ♀🤷 is able to consistently kill 🔫💀 and 💕👦 streak 🔥 high enrages. Telos drops 💦😲 t92 two-hand ✌ weapons consisting of 🔴 the Staff of Sliske, Zaros Godsword, and 👏😁 Seren Godbow.

Telos has 🛒 a unique 👌 looting mechanic where 🌵😾 players can 💦 choose 📥📥 to 🅱🎖 risk the 💩 drops 💦💦 from 🅱 a 👌🅰 kill for increased ➕ chance of 💦 better 💋👎 loot at the 👉 cost of 💦 a 💰👌 more 🔨💳 difficult fight 🔫🔫 known 😝💫 as 😖 streaking. Each 👏 kill players choose 📥📥 to forgo claiming the ⛓😈 loot increases enrage between 👎 5-20%. As 🍑🏻 enrage increases, 📄⤴ mechanics 💰 are added ➕ to 👌💦 the 😈 fight 💯🤼 as 🍑 well as 🏃🏿 every mistake 😳✌ being 😑 much 💯➕ more punishing. A successful kill 💀💀 at 🍆♂ 500% 🖐 enrage unlocks the 👺🖥 green 💚🍏 Warden title, 🤔 a 👹 successful 💪💪 kill 🎺💀 at 👌💁 2000% enrage unlocks the 💊🙊 silver Warden title, 🤔 and 😩➕ enrage is 😗🐶 capped at 👉 4000% where 🏿 a 🐶💓 successful 💪 kill will unlock the 🗣 golden 🏅 Warden title.
.
On 🅱🔛 phases 1 ❌♀ and 👏👏 2, Telos will attack ⚔🤼 with 👏👏 melee unless 👏👏 players ☹💰 are ❓💯 out ➡ of range. When 🍑🕗 out of 👪 range, Telos will 🤔 shoot off a magic ✨✨ attack ⚔🤼 and 👏 move into melee distance again. 😬 Phase 🌗 3 😳😭 is only 👋 magic 📿 auto 🤖 attacks. On phase 🌕🌔 4, 📅 the ⚕🐄 only difference ❗ with 👬 autos from 👊😂 phases 1 🔜 and ➕👏 2 is 💦 when ⏰🍑 players are 👏 out of 💦💦 range, 🤤 Telos will 🅱 continue to use 👎ℹ magic autos rather than move 🏃🏃 into melee range. 💦💦 Phase 5, Telos will only 👨 use 🖐👏 magic 📿 auto 🤖 attacks.

Target cycling 🚴🚴 can 🔫 be 🐝🐝 used 👨 to 💪🌋 tag 🔞🔞 earlier on 🌞💦 phase 🌑 1 ⚫ and 💦 phase 5.

**__Mechanics__**
.tag:p1mechanics
⬥ On P1, a 😍 green 📗💚 beam 🔦 will spawn on 👋😍 telos and 😱 then stay 👏 for ⚠ 20 🔳🔳 ticks. If 🤥 stood 🚶🙋 in 🍆💦 the ☝ beam 🔦 the 💬🍬 player will 🤷🅱 gain 10% adrenaline per 👼👼 tick, and their 💦 prayer 🙏 points 👍 will 🍆💰 be 🏳 drained 📉 slightly, scaling with enrage. While 🙌🕑 Telos stands 😪😪 in the beam, 🔦🔦 his ‼💊 attack ⚔ speed ⏩⏩ will 💰👏 increase 💳💳 from 🍆💥 four 👏 ticks per 👼👼 attack ⚔ to ✌ three 🕛💁 ticks per attack and 👮😩 his special 💦 bar 🥃 will ⚽ fill. 🤤 If 👏 his 💦 special 👋✌ bar 😫🥃 fills on 🔛 P1, Telos will 📌 fire 🔥🔥 off 😫 a So 🙇 Much 👉😂 Power 🏼 in place of his 💦 next ⏩ special. 💅

.
⬥ The Tendrils special 💯🏽 will 🤗❓ require 📜 you to deal 3,000 😘 + 10 × Enrage damage, and 💰🅱 Telos will 🐼🤔 also heal himself 😠😎 while 🕑 channeling this ❓ special. 🏽🏽 Telos also drains your adrenaline while channeling this spec so 😂 it's important ✅😍 to 😅 clear 🔎🔎 it quickly. ⏰🆘
    • You should aim to use a high damage ability like dragonbreath, wild magic or guthix staff spec to cancel this. As enrage goes up it becomes increasingly important to stack damage properly, so it's recommended to use <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wrack:535533809823645697> as these will all hit on the same tick.

⬥ Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>, escape <:escape:535541258832052231>, or bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> away from the Uppercut 1t after the dialogue window disappears. The timing of avoiding this attack will come with practice. Players must be at least three squares away from their original position to not get hit. Players can also resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to negate the typeless damage, but this is not recommended because these are better used on other specials.

.
⬥ Use Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> or Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390>  before Hold Still to avoid the stun, equip wand and shield, and Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>  the big melee hit, but be careful not to resonance the attack that comes right before the actual damage. Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is another way to avoid the damage. Move three squares away to avoid the stomp.
    • If 🅱 you forget to freedom/anticipate, you can 🔫 manually click 🖱 your 💃 shield 💦💦 in your inventory and 🚙 spam 🔁 resonance to 🅱 negate the 🏼🏼 stomp hit. 👊

.
⬥ Continue to 🤔⚠ dps and ⏩ deal with mechanics until phase 🌕 hp. In 🕺👏 general 👮 you 🏿👶 want 👆 to be 👄🐝 phasing either 🐛🐛 immediately 🤣 after the 😫👏 first 👆😊 tendrils, or 😛💰 even ➖♀ before. This 👈 will 👏👏 depend on 🔛♂ enrage, gear and skill 💪 though. 🤔

.
> **__Phase 2__**
.tag:phase2
**__Attack Rotation__**
The first spec will 🅱 depend on 🔛 what 😦 spec was 😟😒 last 😯 used 🙄🎶 on P1, and how 🐼😱 soon 👀⏰ it 💦💦 happens depends on 🔛 how 🅱 many ✋💯 autos are ♀☺ left 👈👈 (max of three). 🏾💁 Refer to spec order 📑 image. 🖼🖼
Assuming 🤓🤓 phase 🌘 after tendrils and 😇💰 before uppercut.

(3-auto attacks after last spec on P1) auto attacks → Magic Onslaught → 3 Autos → Hold Still → 3 Autos → Virus (if 50%+ enrage; uppercut if <50%) → 3 Autos → Uppercut → 3 Autos → Tendrils → 3 Autos → Repeat from Magic Onslaught until phase hp

.
**__Mechanics__**
.tag:p2mechanics
⬥ On P2 a 💰💰 black beam spawns 🤑 on 👀⬇ Telos and 🎅💨 stays for 😤 33 ticks. While 👱 players 📱💰 stand 🕴 in 🐕 the 🔮🌎 beam, 🔦 they take 🤳 and deal 30% ✈ reduced damage. ☄☠ While 🕑 Telos stands 🕴😪 in 👇🚪 the 🤝✈ beam, 🔦 his 🦊 special bar 🥃 will 👀😘 fill and 👏 he will 🤔 take 🅰🅰 20% 🔳🔳 less 👎👎 damage.

.
⬥ Telos will fire off Magic Onslaught hits until his bar is empty. He cannot be moved during this, so if he is standing in the beam, players must block the beam to negate the bar filling. Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> the orange/red attacks if his bar was relatively full before the attack started. Other damage reducing abilities (debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> and reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>) will also reduce the damage taken.

.
⬥ The 👉🏿 virus damage is 👏 negligible at ❓ low 👇👏 enrages, but 🐬 it can 💦 really 😅🔥 cut 🔪🔪 into 🤔 your 🖐👏 food 😩🍗 if 👏 not dealt with 👏👏 quickly 🆘 at 🍆😩 higher enrages so 🤤 you 😩👏 should aim to 😵🔧 clear 📝 this 👎👈 as quickly ⏰ as 🏿 possible.

.
⬥ Deal with 👏 the other mechanics the same as 🍑 you 👎 would ❓ on P1 and ♂ dps until phase hp. Ideally you 😍👉 phase before 🔙💦 the 👏🔎 virus even 🌃🌃 comes out, but 🍑👹 this is 👍🍆 heavily 🔨 influenced by your ✊👏 P1 rotation. It's 🤡😞 important ✅ not to end 👌💯 the phase with 🎉 Tendrils as 🍑 the 🌽 previous spec unless you 👈 are confident dealing 🚬👦 with 🏢 hold 🍆 still as the first spec on 🔛 P3.

.
> **__Phase 3__**
.tag:phase3
**__Attack Rotation__**
Same situation 🤚 where 👏 the 👏🌊 first ☝ spec depends 😝 on last spec from P2; however, there will 🌳😜 always ❗ be seven auto 🤖🤖 attacks first. 😌 Refer to 💬💦 diagram.
Assuming phase after 😡👊 virus 🙀 and ➕ before uppercut.

7 Autos → Uppercut → 3 Autos → Hold Still → 3 Autos → Virus (if 50%+ enrage; skips this spec if <50%) → 3 Autos → Repeat from Uppercut until phase hp

.tag:p3mechanics
⬥ On 🏿 P3, a red ❤🅱 beam will 👻💯 spawn at a 👱 random 🔀 location, lasting for 💰😘 33 ticks. While 🤔 players are standing in the 💓🙌 beam, 🔦 they will 👏🎤 take 🅰 and 👏 deal 30% ✈ increased ➕➕ damage. ☠ While ♀ Telos is 🔢🚫 in 🏼➡ the ☠ beam, he 👨👨 will 😠 deal 30% increased ➕ damage.

.
⬥ Telos’s special bar 🥃 is 🔥👐 replaced by 👌 a 👦💰 balancing bar. 🍻 When 🍑🍑 the bar 🥃😫 is 👌🔺 in 👌👏 the red on the 👏👏 left, Telos will siphon player’s prayer 📢 and 💰 adrenaline. 💉 When the bar is 💦😂 in ⬇ the 🌜❗ red on 🔛🔛 the 👏 right, 🔫🐸 Telos will 🤔 send ➡ out a 🅰 shockwave dealing 🚬 typeless damage. ☠☄ Telos’ bar charges to 💩💦 the right when 👌 he 🤠🏃 is standing in the 🏳 beam 🔦 or golems are 👴🐓 alive. ☠ Telos' bar 😫 naturally moves 🏻💃 to ✋✌ the left 👈 otherwise.

.
⬥ When ⏰😤 the balance is 💰💦 in the red on ♂🔛 the 👏✨ right, 👉 Telos will 😩 emit one ☝😤 shockwave along 🔝🔚 with Uppercut and 💯👦 Hold 🙎 Still. ⏰ Depending on how far 🚷🚷 the ⛪🌜 bar is to 💦 the right, ❤ Telos will 😘 emit up to 🏻💦 three shockwaves with ⚡ the 😎 virus. 🙀 The shockwave can 😡🔫 easily 😊😊 nuke players 📱🎮 at higher enrages. Reflect, debilitate, or 👱 even 🌃😒 barricade can be 🐝🐝 used to 💦👐 survive 😩 being 👏 nuked. On 🔛 the other 🏳 end, 🔚🚫 at 🗽👏 3500%+ enrage, player’s 😤 will 🏻👑 be smited if Telos is 🔥 not allowed 😒🙅 to 💦 step 👞👣 into the beam for 💼😶 a 👌 tick.

.
⬥ When 🕛 starting 🍆🤠 out, 👀⬇ players 📱🎮 can 💦🔫 escape into ➡ the 👽 corner to 💦🎦 ensure 💰💰 Telos does not ✋🚫 have a beam 🔦🔦 spawn on ⬇ him. 👨💬 Once 💦 comfortable, it 🦊 is 💦 better 🎒🏼 to not move from 🏽 drop down ⬇ to get into the 🌊 beam as fast 🏿🚦 as 😖💰 possible. 🔝 Once the ⏩ beam 🔦 spawns, 🤑🤑 bladed dive into it to decrease the 😈 likelihood Telos walk 🏼🚶 over you 👈🍆 into 🚪 the 👏👇 beam. 🔦

.
⬥ The worst case scenario is ending P2 on tendrils because the first spec on P3 will be hold still, so onslaught cannot be fully used to dump dps and the phase can take longer than needed. If this happens, it is often better to just dump thresholds in the beam dealing with mechanics as they come and killing golems if needed. You can also use Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> if necessary.

.
> **__Phase 4__**
.tag:phase4
**__Attack Rotation__**
Again, 😳💯 first spec depends 🤔 on 👞 last spec from 👉 P3. Refer to 🍆 diagram.
Assuming 🤔🤔 last 🙅 spec on P3 was 👏 Uppercut.

3 Autos → Uppercut → 3 Autos → Weak Anima Bomb → 3 Autos → Hold 🙅✋ Still → Repeat until Telos reaches 0 hp

.
**__Mechanics__**
.tag:p4mechanics
⬥ The one 😱☝ new 🆕 special 👋✌ is 🚟🌵 the 😷 weak anima bomb which ♀ can be 🅰🤘 dealt with using 📤📤 debilitate on 👋 Telos or resonance if 🙎 phasing into 💦 a font before 💰 hold ✋ still. 🍺😽

.
⬥ No beams spawn on 🏻 P4; however, there are three fonts which must be ✔ filled 💦 and 👏 used 🚟🚟 to 🎼💦 negate the instakill attack. 🤼 The pure font (next 📆 to 🗣 where you 👆 drop 😉🏿 down) becomes 📉📉 active when ⏰👏 Telos is 😜 at 👒 ¾ hp, volcanic 🌋🌋 at 😔😴 ½ hp, and 👏👏 corrupt at 💦🕛 ¼ hp, moving clockwise around 🍆🕧 the 🏳👏 arena.

.
⬥ Telos’s number 📲😩 of auto 🤖🤖 attacks between 🏻🏻 specs carries over 🙊 from 👉 font to 🎓 font, so 🆙👀 if Telos was one auto attack from 👈 firing 🔫🔫 off 😂😂 a 🍬🐝 weak 😨😤 anima bomb before 💭😈 the 😈 font became 😳😳 active, 🙌 there ✔👩 will 👊🤤 only 👏 be one ♿☝ attack before 🔙🍑 the 👉 weak 😭😨 anima bomb after the instakill. There 😦👏 is a 💩 slight caveat with phasing on 💦🤖 hold 👀🍆 still 😋😽 that ⏪👑 will ✊ be 🐝🎮 discussed 🗣🤔 later. 🕑⏰

.
⬥ When 😩😩 these 🤢 fonts become active, 🙌 Telos is 😄 immune to ♂ damage ☠☠ and one 👨☝ of 😤🍆 each 👏 type ⌨✍ of 👏👏 golem spawns. 🤑 Pure golems (green) deal increased damage the 👉 longer they 👵👬 are 🍑🚟 alive. Volcanic 🌋🌋 golems (red) 🙁🔴 will occasionally stun and 👈 bind players 📱 for ⌛✋ five 🖐🖐 ticks. Corrupt golems (black) reduce player’s 💰 defensive rating by 😈 1% 🔙👌 for 💘 each 👏 stack 📚📚 up to 🚫👏 100 💯💯 stacks. 💰💦

.
⬥ Players must stand ⛱🕴 in 🍑 each 👏👋 font to ✌ charge it. Players 🎮☹ will take five hits of 🎭💦 typeless damage ☄ which can 😉 be reduced with 👈 reflect except 😮 for 💰 the 🔎🅱 last ❌ hit which 👏 can ♂ only 🔑 be 🐝😩 negated with ➡🅱 barricade.

.
⬥ After 👅 using 📤🏻 the 🍁 font to negate the 💰🚧 instakill, player’s defensives will 🏻 be reset and put 😏🆗 on 🔛 a 10 tick cooldown.

.
⬥ The 🍆♀ priority is 😤 to 👀➡ always 👉😡 kill ⚰🙃 the 👦👏 red 🎈🔴 golem as 💰🅱 quickly as 🍑 possible to 👅👏 avoid 🙅🙅 stuns.

.
⬥ Barring taking 😂 an 🐖 eternity to get into the 🍑🏼 first and 👏 third fonts, most 👉 players will 👮🔥 receive 😩🙏 a 👌🏿 So 💯 Much Power 🔌 in 👈🔫 place 🏡🤤 of the next ☃🌨 spec after 😩👀 the 🏻👏 second 🕐 font.

.
⬥ The best way to deal with SMP is to just resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> the hit as this completely negates the hit while preserving adrenaline. SMP behaves much like Hold Still in the sense that an auto attack comes before the actual big damage. Be sure to resonance the SMP not the auto attack.

.
⬥ When trying to resonance SMP with golems still alive, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> away so their hits don't snipe Resonance, or Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857>, Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the SMP.

.
⬥ At lower ❌⬇ enrages a 👌 spirit shield ⚗ can 🛢💁 be 👏🍆 used to 🅱 reduce the hit 💥 from 👉 SMP to 👸 a 😎 survivable number. 🎦😯

.
⬥ If phasing into the 😈👏 font with 😍😫 one 😬 or zero 👰 autos before the 🖇✊ next ⏩ spec, Telos will 🙈🔥 have 🍆 to 🎖 be ❌😱 stun-locked to 🌱😯 allow for 🚟 defensives to come 💺 off 💦 cooldown to 🍆🚓 deal with 👏 SMP.

.
⬥ Continue to dps and deal with mechanics until Telos’s hp hits 0. If <100% enrage, congratulations on loot.

.
__**Tips and 😏 Tricks**__
.tag:p5tips
⬥ To properly tag P5 on the first tick, watch the pure font on the left side, when it does this animation <https://i.imgur.com/H3CceEu.gif>, press target cycle. If using <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> you must throw it one tick after target cycling.

.
⬥ Telos auto-attacks can hit surprisingly hard, so make sure you use Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> at the start of the phase. Use Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> whenever Telos is stunlocked, while minions are alive. Ideally, you should prayer flick between Melee and Magic.

.
⬥ Always 🏻🕔 have a dreadnip deployed. They have a 🙈 chance of 💰 stunning Telos and ☝ consequently triggering his freedom timer - especially helpful during 🏃🚣 P5 start 🕹 and 💰➕ your 👼 onslaught.

.
⬥ Telos' freedom is 💦 triggered on a 👌🅿 set timer, starting from 🏾👉 the 🙏 beginning 😍 of P5, as 🍑 long 📏😄 as you ✈ stun or 🚋 bind 👔🙌 him 👌💕 at 🍆❤ any point ⬆ between 🖕🍼 his ♂🦊 freedoms. This 🔥 means that 💵😐 with 😣 a 👌 20-second 🔳📊 freedom (on 🔛🎅 250-999%), and Asphyxiate having a 👌 cooldown of 💦 20 seconds, your 👏👏 Asphyxiate + Deep Impact combo 🍟 will 👮🏻 always 🏻 stunlock Telos if used properly. 👨 Take ✋ advantage of 💦😳 this! 🏻

.
⬥ In the event that you get an instant kill, use <:immort:535541258538582017> and <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Rotate defensives such as <:reflect:535541258786177064>/<:debil:535541278264393729>/<:devo:513190158728953857>/<:cade:535541306353778689> while finishing telos. Using <:revenge:535541259645878302> is recommended. Use <:anti:535541306475151390> and <:freedom:535541258240786434> if volcanics. The general idea behind this is to maximize damage output on Telos while having defensives up to tank minions.

.
⬥ Minion luring is 💦💯 important ❌🤣 - for 💰💕 side beams, simply 😡😡 standing 🔪 1 🤢♂ out 😐 of 💦 MD will generally 👀 lure the 😭👏 golems properly. 👨 For back 🔙 beams, you want 👏💁 to stand 1 👩👨 out 💯 of 💦🥗 MD, then 😕😁 move 😎 2 💕🙀 squares 😂 back to lure the 👽 golems.
Here 🈁 is 🤔😜 an 🐎 image detailing the lure:

**__Enrage Checkpoints__**
.tag:p5enrage
⬥ **100-149%**: <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and <:dbreath:535533833391702017> under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos cannot use Freedom at this enrage - with stuns and a Sunshine rotation, you should be able to kill him before virus.

.
⬥ **150-249%**: <:tsunami:535533809995874304> under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos will start using Freedom every 30 seconds, however there is no immunity period after using it. You can either tank the virus with Revenge/Reprisal or clear it. This is easily 0 fontable.

.
⬥ **250-349%**: <:tsunami:535533809995874304> under Sunshine will generally kill all of the minions, but you may need to start using <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and <:dbreath:535533833391702017> to clear out remainders. Telos will start using Freedom every 20 seconds, with a 6 second immunity period, and will remain that way all the way to 999%. You should start to learn to clear the virus efficiently - use Debilitate on the virus for safety.

.
⬥ **350-999%**: <:deto:535533833358016512> <:tsunami:535533809995874304> under Sunshine will kill all or most of the minions. Using a Kalphite Rebounder <:kalphiterebounder:643846849223983125> and Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302> may be useful for dealing with the minions, especially if you have Ruthless on your defender. At this point, you can Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> the virus if it comes out, or Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> if low on food, though neither is strictly necessary. DPS and stunning becomes increasingly important in order to get a 0 font.

Goal 💕 with 😍👏 P4 is 💦 to 💦 minimise the 👏🏻 number of 💦🐣 specs (and 😏 hence autos aswell)
This is done 😤 by 😀 using 🤳🤳 ice 🎸 barrage as 🍑 each font ends 🤷 in order to 💦🏼 break 😎 Telos' freedom and ➕ allow 👍✅ effective stunlocking immediately 🤣 - meaning ideally no 💦 autos between 👎👈 each 👏👏 font.
If executed properly you won't get any specs this phase - if you do, use disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> or resonance <:res:535541258844635148> where convenient.

.
**__On Drop down__**
*Note: Slightly dependent on how much adren you have left over from P3. This is the best time to use your adren pot unless already high adren.*

.
⬥ Assuming 0% 😏🅱 start: 🍆
<:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> + <:comb:535533833098100745> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) > <:wrack:535533809823645697> → <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> <:impact:535533809655873556> → <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> <:wrack:535533809823645697> 
*Note: Can replace <:deep:535533833139912724> with <:dbreath:535533833391702017> if Telos' hp is low. Important thing is to go into the first font with 50%+ adrenaline ideally.*

.
⬥ If Telos' freedom is up:
<:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:comb:535533833098100745> → <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) → <:wrack:535533809823645697>

.
**__First font__**
*Note: When Telos reaches phase hp he'll activate the font and walk over to it. This will cause you to lose your target so (unless you tag a minion) you can use defensive thresholds for free.*

.
⬥ Go straight into font, vuln <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> if possible or wait till after <:revenge:535541259645878302>/<:reflect:535541258786177064>. 
<:res:535541258844635148> (if you still have a target) → <:reflect:535541258786177064> → <:revenge:535541259645878302> → (Tag minion) → <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:prep:535541258546970624> → 4t AoE minions until the font fully charges → <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> and step away from golems → target Telos <:deto:535533833358016512> → <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) → <:wrack:535533809823645697> if close to phase hp, or continue stunlocking.
⬥ <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> before going into 2nd font

.
**__Second font__**
*Note: Can optionally stall for reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> here (safer and allows you to deto <:deto:535533833358016512> out of the font) or just run straight in, using resonance <:res:535541258844635148> on one of the font hits.*

.
⬥ AoE minions again, freezing and stepping away as the font finishes charging. Depending on how many autos you have till SMP, can opt to stall an abil instead of using ice barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> instantly - you'll sometimes get an auto if you do this however.
⬥ If 😂 you 👈 stalled for reflect:
<:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:impact:535533809655873556> <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:wrack:535533809823645697>
⬥ Otherwise:
(stalled) <:wm:535533809978966037> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778>  (3-hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:wrack:535533809823645697>

.
**__Third font__**
⬥ Same as first font. Try to go straight into the font without getting a target from the minions → <:reflect:535541258786177064> → <:revenge:535541259645878302> → <:anti:535541306475151390> and 4t AoE minions.
⬥ You want to aim to have high adren going into p5 but <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) → <:wrack:535533809823645697> should be sufficient to phase.

**__Footnotes__**
⬥ **Side Beams**
You can use Omnipower <:omni:535533809664262179> before Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> is good if you're confident you won't get Virus. Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> is otherwise better due to keeping adrenaline for Barricade and Reflect

Rockfall can be dodged allowing you to skip Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>, can still use it for increased safety.

Optionally skip Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>, or Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302> before Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> in order to gain more stacks for Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>

If you get volcanics, Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> after Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314>.

⬥ **Back Beam** 🔦
If you get volcanics, Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> after Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302>. With bad RNG, or being slow to beam you will have to Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> right before Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302> if you're getting hit on the way there.
