> __**Introduction**__
The Arch-Glacor is a large glacor general fighting under Wen. The Arch-Glacor is massable in Normal Mode, but must be fought solo on Hard Mode, which introduces a enrage mechanic similar to Telos <:Telos:513212949033123840>.

It is important to note that the Arch-Glacor is only affected by the Glacor slayer task on Normal Mode. The slayer helmet <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> bonus and genocidal <:genocidal:689503091539705870> bonus will work on The Arch-Glacor; however, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> will not be boosted.

.tag:drops
⬥ Normal Mode: Scripture of Wen <:wengodbook:883134307902816297> and the Leng Artefact <:lengartefact:884739993543782420> which is used to upgrade Nightmare Gauntlets <:nightmaregauntlets:679628668120727571>, Gloves of Passage <:glovespassage:643166351585706060> and Kerapac's Wristwraps <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940> to their upgraded variants. The Arch-Glacor always drops 3 piles of loot in Normal Mode. Each pile contains at most 1 Dark Nilas <:darknilas:884739993527013426>.

⬥ Hard Mode: The Frozen Core of Leng <:frozencoreofleng:884739993527025704> used to upgrade the t85 melee weapons to t95 can only be obtained from Hard Mode. In Hard Mode, a player will receive a roll of loot in the Frozen Vault, where players can choose to risk the drops from a kill for increased chance of better loot at the cost of a more difficult fight known as streaking, much like Telos. Each kill players choose to forgo claiming the loot increases enrage between 5-20%. 1 to 42 Dark Nilas <:darknilas:884739993527013426> can be obtained in a single roll.

> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
From the start of the fight, the Arch-Glacor will cycle through 5 different mechanics (Glacyte Minions, Flurry, Pillars of Ice, Frost Cannon and Exposed Core) in sets in random order. Once a set of 5 mechanics are completed, the next set will begin. This repeats until the fight ends.

⬥ Normal mode: All mechanics except for Creeping Ice can be toggled off, which decreases the Arch-Glacor's HP but lowers the quality of drops.

.
__**Creeping Ice**__
⬥ Normal mode: Ice Shards approach slowly from either side and force the player into a specific area of the arena. These areas are different for each mechanic:

⬥ Hard Mode: The melee damage dealt scales with enrage.

Flurry: Middle
Pillars of Ice: West
Frost Cannon: West, Middle, or East
Exposed Core: Middle

If players are pushed by the Creeping Ice, they will be struck with a small amount of melee damage and pushed in the direction the ice is approaching, interrupting any channels. If a player attempts to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> on the tick they are pushed, they will be pulled back to the spot where they were standing and then pushed.

.
__**Glacyte Minions**__
⬥ Normal Mode: The Arch-Glacor spawns 4 glacyte minions. As well as attacking the player, the Arch-Glacor will be immune to damage until all its minions are killed. Minions have 2500 HP, the light blue ones attack with mage while the dark blue ones attack with melee. 

⬥ Hard Mode: Minions have 13500 HP until 2500% enrage. Starting from 250% enrage, a Bolstered Glacyte minion will additionally spawn, it has 27000 health and attacks with melee. After 2500% enrage on hard mode, all minions' health start to scale. 

It is worth noting that the spawning animation will interrupt the attack animation of the previous auto attack, but the auto attack will still go through, this is especially important to know if the previous mechanic is Flurry.

.
__**Flurry**__
⬥ Normal Mode: The Arch-Glacor's auto attacks will switch between more damage types with high damage in their respective style, it now attacks with Mage and Ranged. The player has increased damage reduction when praying against the correct combat style.

⬥ Hard Mode: The Arch-Glacor gains a melee attack where it swipes one of its arms across the arena. The damage from auto attacks scale with enrage.

This mechanic can carry over into Glacyte Minions.

.
__**Pillars of Ice**__
⬥ Normal mode: The Arch-Glacor forces the player to the west side and calls down elemental beams from the sky. The first beam appears shortly after the Arch-Glacor raises its arms, with the second beam appearing just before the Creeping Ice disappears. Being hit by the beam deals a random amount of hard typeless damage, and saps 8% of max Prayer points. 

⬥ Hard mode: A third beam will appear shortly after second around the middle of the arena. Beams will additionally drain 1% adrenaline for every hit on the player. The damage from beams scale with enrage.

All beams despawn around 20 seconds after the first beam spawns. 

.
__**Frost Cannon**__
⬥ Normal Mode: The Arch-Glacor traps the player in a small area and launches a huge surge of energy at them. The beam deals a high hit of magic, with damage depending on the number of mechanics enabled. 

⬥ Hard Mode: The beam now deals 3 hits, a 6 second stun <:stunicon:841419289428492369> and bind is also applied on the player on with the first hit of the cannon. The damage does not scale with enrage.

The recommended to deal with this mechanic is casting Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> with Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> active for the first 2 hits and casting Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> for the 3rd hit while flicking to SoulSplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> to heal back to full.

.
__**Exposed Core**__
⬥ Normal Mode: The Arch-Glacor releases its frozen core into the centre of the arena, trapping players with its arms, each having 17500 HP. The frozen core damages and applies a stacking debuff on the player, each stack increasing the damage dealt. The player must kill either of the arms and get out of its proximity in order to stop the damage.

⬥ Hard Mode: Arms now have 32500 HP, which starts to scale with enrage after 2500%.

.
__**Enrage**__
On Hard Mode, the Arch-Glacor's HP and auto attack damage increases with enrage.
