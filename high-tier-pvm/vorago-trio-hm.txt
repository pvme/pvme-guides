**__Introduction__**
Basing Trio Hard Mode is typically performed by a *Melee*. The Base Tank has several responsibilities, the most important being to apply the Statius's Warhammer <:swh:641670143197446182> special attack in *every* phase. Additionally you are expected to properly lure Vorago in phase 1 on the eastern wall so that the Climber (referred to as *Bomb Tank #2*) does not receive any Blue Bombs.

.
**__Required__**
⬥ **Statius's Warhammer** <:swh:641670143197446182> (stored in an **Essence of Finality** <:eofor:745279787471470713>, you will be using at least 10 SWH specs per kill, this can be very costly otherwise)

.
**__Recommended__**
⬥ **Heightened Senses** <:heightenedsenses:697808773573771344> (this relic is essential for approaching fast kills with advanced strategies)
⬥ **Stalling Abilities**
⬥ Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing>

__**Base Tank - Phase 🌔😶 1**__ 💸
.tag:basep1
⬥ In phase 1 the Base Tank is responsible for luring Vorago in such a way that the top lure cannot receive Blue Bombs. This also causes the Base Tank to receive Blue Bombs on top of melee Swipes, therefore pray flicking between melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> is required. Additionally, when the kill timer reaches ~ 30 seconds, you must bring the boss close enough to the final platform of the climb, from where the Climber will voke <:voke:535541259465392143> Vorago into jump spot.

⬥ The easiest way to position correctly in the start is by *standing east of Vorago's spawn location*, tagging the boss, moving *two tiles to the east*, and finally *two tiles to the south*. By moving two tiles east, Vorago is far enough away from the Climber. Moving two tiles south and then attacking the boss causes you to face north-west, enabling the capability of simply surging <:surge:535533810004262912> north-west when it is time to take the boss closer to the Top Lure.

⬥ You should surge as the top lure is jumping the last ledge. Continue running to stall Vorago until the Top Lure vokes, then bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> south. Provoke <:voke:535541259465392143> Vorago, and wait for the Top Lure to jump.

⬥ One of 💦 the most ☺☺ important ✅❌ aspects of Phase 1 🤜 is to 💰💦 pay 💵 attention to 🔜 Vorago's lifepoints - You ♻ do 👀💯 not 👎🙅 want 💞 to 💦➡ deplete it 😼💯 too quickly, as you 👉😨 may 🕳🗓 accidentally 😣 reset the HP. Due to the 🔙 ease 🙂 of 🥜 getting 😧🍆 Vorago's HP low enough ❌ in 😏👌 time, 🕐 you ☝ will generally 👀 have to 🔥💦 slow your 🅱🍆 damage down intentionally 😜 before ❄ surging.

__**Base Tank - Phase 🌘 2**__ 💁🙈
.tag:basep2
The 📚🔮 Base 😢😿 Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 🌑 2 🏿 are 🏼👏 not 🙅 any 🈸💦 different to basing Normal Mode.

.

.tag:basep38
__**Base Tank - Phase 🌕🌑 3 😭 Ceilings**__
.tag:basep3
⬥ **Strategy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> in the end of Phase 2
    • Pre-Ultimate <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as you drop into Phase 3
    • Drink from your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>
    • Place a Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> as soon as possible

.
⬥ Fast ⌚ teams should simply 😡 aim for 🎅⚠ 0-linking the 👭🐃 phase. 🌓🌔

⬥ If a Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:sgb:626466665848242186> shortly after.

⬥ For slower teams you may also make use of your Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> ability during Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 🌓 4 🤐 Scopulus**__
.tag:basep4
The Base Tank has to lure all Scopuli, in addition to hammering the eastern and northern Scopulus. A frequent usage of Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> is very useful for keeping up all Scopuli's stacked and aggressioned towards you, due to vuln bombs dragging Scopulus' aggro.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Stand 👫 directly ➡➡ west of 💦😱 the 💦 *western* 🤠 Scopulus
    • Throw a Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> 3 - 4 seconds before Target Cycle to the *eastern* Scopulus's spawn location
    • Throw another 🏗 bomb 💥 as 👦👂 soon 🤤 as possible 🔝 (after 👀👀 3 💵 ticks) directly under ⬇ you 😰🔱 in order to drag the 👏💻 *western* 🤠 Scopulus's aggression
    • Attack both southern Scopuli with a few abilities <:gbarge:535532879250456578> > <:assault:535532855191928842> first Scop > <:swh:641670143197446182> second Scop
    • As the northern Scopulus comes close enough, target, attack and voke <:voke:535541259465392143> it
    • Run 🏃 directly ➡ south by 😈 a 👌🎁 few 🔛👇 tiles and back 🏼 north, 💈☝ straight 👫🌈 through 🚟 the 🚮 Scopuli (this 🔎🌎 should 👫 stack the Scopuli next 👉🌨 to / on 💯✋ top 🔼 of 👉🐙 each 👏👏 other) 👈🏽

.
⬥ For slower phases you should utilize Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and eventually Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 🌗🌑 5 😂 Vitalis**__
.tag:basep5
Trio Hard 🍆💦 Mode approaches Phase 5 🏼 similar 👱 to 💰 a fast Duo Normal 🖖 Mode Vitalis Phase 3. 😘 All players 💰💰 stay 💯👩 in 👌 melee distance and 📗😽 must pray 🙏 flick between melee deflme4 and magic 📿 deflm4. The 🍑 Base 😢 Tank commonly 🤔 takes 💜💜 the 🙌 south-western 👇👇 corner ⤵ in 🏠 melee distance to 💦💦 Vorago.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as you drop into Phase 5
    • Place a Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> as soon as possible
    • Activate Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> for this Berserk

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply 😡 aim for 🎅 0-linking 😅 the 🌧 phase, just 👌 like Phase 🌗🌔 3. 💵

⬥ If a Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack <:ingen:641339234111848463> <:sgb:626466665848242186> shortly after.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 👏🌗 6 Green 🤢 Bomb**__ 💦💣
.tag:basep6
At the beginning of the phase, it is recommended to voke <:voke:535541259465392143> Vorago and walk the boss far enough so that you will not be harmed by a mid mist, and can attack vorago from at least two different of the 9 grid arena sections of the arena.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Apply SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> as soon as possible

.
⬥ On this phase, you will simply be dumping thresholds. On target cycle, release your hammer <:swh:641670143197446182> with a bled assault <:assault:535532855191928842> and continue to thresh.

⬥ SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> can be perfectly implemented in your pre-Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> ability damage rotation.

⬥ If you receive a Green Bomb, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> in order to easily survive it. If the Green Bomb is not on you, it is an optimal strategy to heal the respective Bomb Tank, shortly after they tanked the 10,000 detonation damage.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 🌗 7 ❗❗ Team Split**__
.tag:basep7
Similar 👱 to 🅱😉 Phase 🌕 6, 🤔👆 you 👦 will again 😭 only be hammering and 🏻👏 thresholding.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Apply SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> as soon as possible (in Target Cycle)
    • Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> the first Team Split if you target cycled

.
⬥ There exist several *advanced* strategies. Based on your preference, you can either utilize your Adrenaline potion <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> during Phase 7 to have adrenaline to Natty <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> at the end of the phase, or perform a slightly less adrenaline-intensive rotation and save your the Apot for Phase 8.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 🌑🌓 8 The 🖖 End**__
.tag:basep8
⬥ **Strategy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> in the end of Phase 7
    • Pre-Ultimate <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as you drop into Phase 8
    • (optional, if available) Drink from your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>
    • Place a Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> as soon as possible (on Target Cycle)
    • (optional, if available) Activate Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> for this Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>

.
⬥ Fast teams should 🤔 easily be capable 🏻 of 💦😎 skipping this 😂 phase's 🌒😶 Stand Up.

⬥ If 🤤 a 😻 Stand 🕺 Up 🆙👆 is 💦👐 expectably happening, 🐰 your 🙄 team 💰💰 should tag 🔞🔞 either Red Bombs or 🍆 Blue 😂 Bombs, depending on what you agree 😂 on. This 👈 aspect is ❌ a 👌 responsibility of 📰🔥 your 👱 Bomb 💣 Tanks and 👏 the 👨💌 Base 🙄 Tank does not have to 🔥💦 worry about 💦 it.

⬥ Drink a sip of the Powerburst of Vitality <:vitality:654618235097972737> a few seconds after Stand Up. Alternatively, your bomb tanks may just choose to Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> and Intercept <:Cept:543478434509357098> on Stand Up, due to the relative ease of 0-linking this phase.

.tag:rangep12
__**Ranged Bomb 💦💦 Tank - Phase 🌕😶 1**__ ⬆🔙
.tag:rangep1
⬥ It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago, referred to as Bomb Tank #1. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2.

⬥ A simple Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches 50,000 HP and off early enough to avoid a reset.

⬥ If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb (random), you should cast Heal Other <:HealOther:567727985851891715> to support the Base Tank's food management.

⬥ Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading <:cade:535541306353778689> and intercepting <:Cept:543478434509357098> the first and third Red Bomb. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

**__General Tips__**
⬥ If performing the BT#2 role, transfigure <:Transfigure:553050196523876354> for the 14k entry hit

⬥ Stalling abilities is sometimes easier by mouse clicking a dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> placed far away from your drop location and far-casting an ability, instead of equipping Excalibur <:excal:641337999170207763>.

⬥ Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7, after tagging bombs P8

⬥ Stay MD +1 in the start of P5 until Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064>

⬥ Take Crackling <:crack4:712073087662686249> off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9

⬥ Remove the armour piece with Mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> for Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> / Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> / Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> generating adrenaline

⬥ Heal Other <:HealOther:567727985851891715> your Base Tank in P1 if they receive the Red Bomb and end of P2, P3, P4, P6 and P7

⬥ Rather skip Natty <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> than nattying too late

__**Magic Bomb 💣 Tank - Phase 😶🌔 1**__ 🏋❌
.tag:magep1
⬥ It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2.

⬥ As 🍑 Magic ✨✨ Bomb Tank you will 🅱 most 🐶🔝 likely be the one 😣 climbing in Phase 🌑 1. 🗿👱

⬥ Yet, if you happen to be the one DPSing, a simple Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches 50,000 HP and off early enough to avoid a reset.

⬥ If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb (random), you should cast Heal Other <:HealOther:567727985851891715> to support the Base Tank's food management.

**__General Tips__**
⬥ Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> should be pre-charged in most phases, as charging it during Reflects <:reflect:535541258786177064> would cause Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> to be on cooldown for the following phase

⬥ Use Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> as primary spell, Blitz might be nulled by Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> (also P4 Scopulus benefits heavily from Barrage)

**__Introduction__**
A general Hybrid setup for Trio HM consists of Melee <:Attack:689509250472476758> as primary and either Ranged <:Ranged:689504724403486920> or Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> as secondary combat style. Magic is recommended due to the naturally increased hitchance on Scopuli. At the current unbalanced state of combat styles, there exists only one method of making Hybrid effective over a double Ranged Bomb Tank setup. Hybridding is only recommended if your goal is improved kill speed, as your team is a lot more likely to lose a kill.

⬥ It is highly discouraged to take a BoB familiar (Mammoth scrolls with Soups <:sailfishsoup:537336701933060106>), due to the lost accuracy from a Nihil familiar already making Ranged a better choice over Hybrid. Therefore a Hybrid setup ends up having a very small amount of food (1 - 3 inventory slots). The selected aura should be Berserker <:berserker:643505116347105290>.

⬥ In ⬅ phases 1, 2, 4 (Scopulus) and 9 ℹ😍 the Hybrid Bomb 💥 Tank uses 🆒🆒 the 👏🦉 secondary combat 🔫🤼 style, 😋 Ranged or 😛🙅 Magic. 📿✨

⬥ Throughout phases 3 - 8 (excluding Scopulus P4) Melee is to be used. A primary portion of these phases will require you (the Hybridder) and the Base Tank to *step under* Vorago, with the BT#1 voking <:voke:535541259465392143> the boss.

⬥ Depending on the outcome of 👬🍒 your 👉🙋 Phase 🌒 10, you 👈👉 will either 🐛 camp Melee for 🎁 the start of 💦 P11 or 🍆🎡 switch to 💦 your 📥👉 secondary combat ♂ style 💦💀 immediately during 🚣🏃 phase 🌑🌑 transition.

.
⬥ As Hybrid 👱 Bomb Tank you will 👏 be the 🤔 one 💪 climbing in 👏 Phase 🌕🌗 1. ➗

.tag:hybridp2
⬥ The Bomb 💥💥 Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 😍 are not 🤦 any different to 👏💦 bomb tanking Normal 🖖 Mode.

⬥ Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading <:cade:535541306353778689> and intercepting <:Cept:543478434509357098> the first and third Red Bomb. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

⬥ You should have one person dedicated to shattering <:Shatter:536256673904328704> the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

.
*Note: Due to lacking inventory space as a Hybridder, it is recommended to have either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank #1 take an additional Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473>. One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> during Bring Him Down (preferably the BT#1).*

__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 🌗 3 🎆 Ceilings**__
.tag:hybridp3
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> in the end of Phase 2
    • Pre-Ultimate <:Berserk:513190158468907012> as you drop into Phase 3

    • Utilize Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> for this Sunshine

.
⬥ Place a Combat Dummy <:dummy:656844963522281473> in the end of the phase (preferably the BT#1).

⬥ The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept <:devo:513190158728953857> <:Cept:543478434509357098> for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage.

This dummy must be placed in the east and you have to be distanced at least 1 tile to the southern wall. The Base Tank should always maul with a prior cast Shield Dome!

*Note: Ranged Bomb Tanks should apply BSA <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617> throughout phases 10 and 11 to compensate for decreased hitchance once the Base Tank's SWH <:swh:641670143197446182> spec runs out.*

> __**Advanced Phases 10 & 11**__
.tag:advanced
Approaching phases 10 🔟🅾 and 💰 11 in 😏👉 advanced teams is 😍 independent 🙅 of 💰 weekly mechanics. 💰💰

.
**__Overview__**
⬥ In 🐕⬇ Phase 10 you 🤤 always 🤔💯 aim for 🌍 0-speccing ➕➕ (get to 💴🚓 maul before ⏪ the 🦃🎆 spec release, e.g. Purple ☂ Bomb or 😩 Vitalis orb ). This ⬇👇 is achieved 🏆🏆 by 😈🚟 pushing 🖐 consecutively every 😤💯 3 🥜😗 ticks for 8 😍 tiles from 🙍😂 Target Cycle on. 👇🔛 Once 🌈💦 you 😵🏻 reached maul spot, you 👈 wait 😭 for 💰🎄 the 🤡👽 spec to release and 👏👏 maul right 🌃 after. 👀👀

⬥ If Phase 👏 10 🔟😰 was 👏 executed 😵 correctly, 🤗✔ Phase 🌕 11 should 👶👫 always 🕰 start with 3 💦🔀 auto 🤖🤖 attacks (5 😂😂 if first P10 spec is Green ♻😩 Bomb 💦💥 or 😫🙅 Purple ☂☂ Bomb) 💥💥 into 💦 the second spec of P11.
