> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
Araxxor is 🤔🈶 an 😘 Araxyte spider who 🤔🤔 lives 🤕 in the 👽 Araxyte lair, a 🎯👌 cave 🕳 beneath the 👏 Haunted Woods, just 🗣👌 south 👇👇 of 💰💦 Port 🔥 Phasmatys.

.
**__Into the Spider's Den__**
⬥ He 👨👑 can 💦 be 🎮🌈 fought 🔫🔫 solo or 🚪➕ duo, although 😛😛 he ♂ is 💯 considerably stronger 💪 if you 🏿 duo. 
    • When 🕐 there 👌❓ are two 💏 people 👪 fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are 😍 doubled, and 👏🏿 the 👏👏 higher of 🚑🔟 the 🔚 two base enrage values is 🤔 used. 🚟🎶 
        - This includes minion 💩 spawns and 👏 its 💰 strength 👊 in 👏🅱 general.

.
⬥ The 📜🤡 fight 😫😫 is heavily 💦💦 influenced by 😈👊 the 😢🅱 player's 👨 choice. 👐 
    • The 👏👀 player 🏋💰 must 🙋🙋 choose from 🕒 one 💦😫 of the 👽 available 💢 paths at 😔 the beginning of 👏🔴 the fight 👿 by 🚟😈 burning 🔥 one of the 👏👏 giant 😱😱 webs near 😯 entrance of the 💞👺 hive and waiting ⌚⌚ one minute until the 🔥👏 chosen path opens. 
        - The 👌 player's 👨 choice of path 🛣🛣 will 🍑📃 affect Araxxor's combat 🔫🗡 mechanics 💰 throughout the 🎁🅱 rest 🚨🛏 of 🍞 the fight. 🏾 Only two of the three paths are 🈶🔢 available ❌ on any 🤔😱 given 👤⤵ day. 🌞🏾

.
⬥ Despite ♂ displaying a 👌 "None" weakness 😳 in 👌🚪 the 💡🗣 combat 🤼 interface, Araxxor's 3 different 💬 forms actually have ♂💴 weaknesses in 🌆⏳ line 〰🙋 with 😋 the 👨👏 combat 🤼 triangle. 
    • Players 📱💰 carrying an 🏿 Araxyte pheromone in ♀ their 🍆😂 inventory will 👏 cause 💋👱 Araxxor to spawn using a 🤔 combat 🔫🤼 style favourable to the player. 📅💰 
        - For example, 🔥 using 🤳 ranged to 👋 fight Araxxor while 🕗 holding 👐 an 👹🏿 araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will 🍆 cause 💋🎗 Araxxor to spawn using 🤳 Magic. ✨✨ 
        - Simply creating an 👹🍆 instance has 🚪 the same effect 🐆 as bringing a 👌 pheromone as 🍑🌐 well.

*Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks.*

.
> __**Drops**__
.tag:drops
His 💦 drops include components for three 💁🏾 level 🍒🔻 90 💯❌ two-handed weapons, one for 👦🍆 each 👏 combat 🏹🔫 style, along 🔚🔝 with a 🤑🏽 pet, with multiple skins to be 🤰 unlocked 🔓 for 👉 the pet through ➡👉 achievements.

⬥ <:pheromone:643122483641188372>  **Pheromone**: 1/(50-[Enrage/20])

> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
⬥ Araxxor will 🤔 use a ➡ special 👋 attack every 🏦🅰 5 auto 🤖🤖 attacks
    • Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the 5th auto attack
        - While either 😌 of 💦 these 😍 abilities are 👴💁 up, ♀👀 the 👧 player will not pulled 😈😈 in 👏🏼 by the 👶😨 cleave and the cocoon special attack ⚔ will 💍 not ♂🚫 last as 🍑💰 long.
⬥ Araxxor will 🎧 never use 👏 the 💞 same special 💦💦 twice ✌ in 🏼 a 💰 row. For example, if 👏❗ araxxor cleaves, the next 👉😽 special 👾😂 will 🙋📌 not ✋⛔ be 👨 a 🏻 cleave.

.
__**Cleave**__
⬥ Araxxor pulls you 😘 in 🍑 and hits 🎯🎯 the 💉💰 player with a large typeless hit 👉😎 unless 💁 the 💉💞 player can 💸 get 😢 out of the 💰 attack 🤼⚔ range. 🤤🤤
    • With Melee and 🌬 Magic, 📿 the 👏🙌 player will 💰💦 always 👌 need to 😉💦 run 😱🏃 away 👆⛔ a 😵📝 few tiles to 💰 avoid 🙅 this.
    • With Ranged, the player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to avoid being dragged in.

.
__**Cocoon**__
⬥ Araxxor Wraps the 🤡 player 🏋💰 in a 🏫💰 cocoon, causing them 👩 to 😵 take 🅰😀 damage ☄☄ every tick until they 🙎⚖ escape.
    • To escape, simply 😡 spam 🔁 click.
    • The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> active before this special attack comes.

.
__**Web Shield**__
⬥ Araxxor covers himself 😠 with a web and 🅱✋ heals himself. ❌ 
⬥ This 👈⤴ special reflects a ☢🐝 random 🔀 % of 💦💯 the 🌛 damage you 👉 deal back to 🏿✌ you. 💦 
    • To 💦 deal with 👏😶 this mechanic, simply 😡😡 do 😭♂ not attack. ⚔ 
    • This ⬇ special 💦 attack ⚔⚔ can ❗ be 🤘 used 🚟 to gain 🔑 some 👨💭 health 💉⛑ back 💀 by using 📤 Resonance on 💯 your own 🍆 hit, 👊👏 
        - For melee, it is 💦✅ recommended to use 👏 Quake 😏 since 💦 it hits 👊🎯 slow 🚢 enough 💦 for 💰 you 💦☝ to 😫😦 equip a 👀 shield and 💦🔙 catch 🔥 the 😈👏 resonance. 
        - For 🎁 range 🤤🤤 it is recommended to 💦💯 use 👏🏾 snipe for 🔜😘 the same reason. 🌟 
        - Be 👏 wary of crackling and 👏🔝 aftershock proccing during 🏃🚣 this 👈🌎 because it 😞😝 can 💦💦 reflect a 💰👌 lot 🤣 of unexpected damage ☠ back. 😔💨

.
__**Minion Spawn**__
⬥ Araxxor has 👏✅ 20 🔳 total 👌 minions it 😤😂 can spawn. It spawns them 😁😲 in 4 🕑 waves 🌊 of 🤔👌 5 ☠ spiders each. 👏
    • Deal with 💯🅱 this 🍑 mechanic by getting 🙀👏 off ➡⚾ right 👉➡ before 🍑⏪ the special 💦💅 spider spawns, and 💻💦 killing 🔪 it 😩 asap. 
    • Killing 🔪 the 🔚 remaining 🕵🕵 spiders is optional but can 🔫 help 💁🛠 you 🏻🍆 take 😥📴 less 〽 damage ☠☄ if 🏃👩 the phase 🌑🌑 goes 🚋 slowly.
⬥ When 👌🍆 path 🛣 1 🥈💪 is 💦🈁 open, this 😡⤴ special 🎁✈ attack can occur 👻👻 on 🔛📱 Phase 3/4 ❤🕑
    • if Path 🛣 1 👷🤢 was 👏⏱ taken, 🚀🔫 minions 💙💙 can 🗑🔫 also be spawned on Phase 🌘🌑 2 😍🙊 
⬥ Outside 🚭🚭 of 💦 Phase 4, there ❌✔ is 💦 a 🚓 predictable order to these 🚑 spawns. Each of ✝ the 🚀 first 👌 3 🏼 waves will 👏🤤 contain a special 😂👾 spider, either 😤 a ⏰🅱 Mirrorback or 😩🚨 Pulsing. 
    • In 👏❤ the first 😌 wave, 🌊🏄 it's the 😼😂 **third** 🤔 to spawn. 
    • In 🏡 the ♂ second ✌⏱ wave, 🌊 it's the 🏻👑 **second** ⏱🅱 to spawn.
    • In 🌋 the third 🤔 wave, it's 😘 the 🤡 **first** 🕐😌 to 💦 spawn.
    • There is ☎ no special ✌🏽 spider in the fourth wave.

.
__**Egg Bomb**__ 💥
⬥ Araxxor will 💯 spawn a 😯 group of 👶👨 2 🙀😂 or 👉 3 eggs and 🚙🙏 fire a 💰 slow ⏰ moving projectile at 👅👌 you. 👈 
    • To 💦👏 mitigate damage, simply stand on 🔛🔛 the 📈 eggs. 🍳🍳 The projectile will explode, 💥 and 💏 kill 🙃💀 all 👏 eggs 🍳 within 👏 a ⌛ 4x4 radius. 
        - If 👉 3 ❤💦 eggs 🍳 are exploded, the 💬 player will 💰 take 🐣🏼 300 damage. 
        - If 2 😳 eggs 🍳🍳 are exploded, the ♨ player will take 1200 damage.
        - If 1 egg 🥚🈴 is 🌈💦 exploded, the ♀ player 📅📅 will take 👏 2100 damage ☠
        - If 👏 0 ➖⬅ eggs are 😩🔢 exploded, the 💞🍆 player 💰 will take 📴👀 3000 damage. 
        - If 👏 eggs are not 🖐❌ exploded, then 🕛 they ♂ will 💦 hatch into spiders as 😱 well. 😨😨 The first special 💅💅 attack ⚔ on 👌 phase 🌔🌓 2 💕🏿 for 😍🍆 top 👆 path will always be egg bomb. 💣

.
__**Instakill Spider**__
⬥ Araxxor will 👌🎤 perform 👌 a 🗣😧 melee attack ⚔🤼 animation ⛏🍑 and 😲👏 send out 🤔💦 a projectile which will 💰😬 leave ♀ a green mark 🏼✌ where it 😂 lands; the 👉 spider will spawn here. ‼ 
⬥ The Acid Spider will start 🆕⏸ walking 🚶 towards ⛪⛪ you with 👏 a 👌 gauge bar 🥃😫 above its head 😉 that 💊 fills up. 😍⬆ 
    • when 💦 it 😳 fills up fully, the 👏👨 spider will 🖕👏 explode 💥💥 and 👏 you 😇🏿 will 🐼 be 🏼🐝 safe. 👷 
    • If 🚟 it 😧 touches you before ⬅ the ♂🌞 bar fills up 👋 it 👎 will explode 💥💥 on 🔛😜 you ♥ and 🏿👌 deal a severe amount of damage. ☄ 
    • its 🤳 speed ⏩⏩ is 🏻🎃 variable. 
    • To 💯😛 deal with 😄😲 this, 💯 you can 💦 either: 🐛
        - Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> or Immortality <:immort:535541258538582017> to negate the damage from the spider.
        - Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline.
        - Run away or 👉💁 dodge it if you have room 😈 to ♀ do so. ❓🆗

.
__**Acid Spiders**__
⬥ On 🔛 phase 🌕 3, 😩😭 Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid 😛👍 Spiders. These 📄🚑 can 🔫 be lured into 🔍➡ Araxxor to 👌💦 reduce the enrage of 💦💦 the 🎁 boss. 💼
    • To 👶 do this, 😎 click on 👇⬇ them 😀💁 and 🏼💦 lure them beneath ⚰⚰ Araxxor.
    • It is 😇💰 better to just ♀ ignore 🔇🔇 these 🍆🚑 spiders.
    • They ✨ are distinct from 👩 the 💞👫 instakill spiders encountered, as they 👨 do 💯 not have 🙋 a 🚨🎹 gauge bar, 🥃 and touching them 😣😘 results 🔢 in 👏💀 nothing ♂ happening. 💦💦 
    • The amount 📉 that 🚟🚟 spawns 🤑🤑 is related to the amount of 💦💦 acid 💯👍 absorbed in 👉 the ❌ middle path. 🛣🛣 
        - You 👈 must 🙋 absorb 50% 👏🔫 of 💦 the acid 💯💦 in 😩👏 the middle 👈 path 🛣 (100% 💯 in duo) in 🍆👌 order 📑 to proceed to phase 🌑 3. 
        - If 🏃🏿 the ⏩ middle path is 😒 not 🏼 taken, 😔😔 4 😭😘 acid spiders will spawn (25% 👏👏 each); this scales down 👇🏼 for 🕒💰 middle path. 🛣🛣

.
__**Light Spots**__
⬥ The 💴 Room 🚪 will 👏👏 go dark and 👏😮 there will 👏👏 be 🐝😠 a ♂ lit 🔥🔥 up ☝ spot. 🏠
    • This occurs the 💞😃 entire 🏼🙌 time on phase 2 🕝 darkness path, 🛣🛣 and 🍒💦 on ➡↕ phase 🌑🌕 3 and 🔟 4 👀🍆 if 👉 path 3 is 👅 open. 🍑 
    • Stand 🕴 in the light 💡💡 spot ⏺ to 💦💦 avoid 🙅🙅 damage. 
        - On 💰👌 lower enrages this can 🔫🔫 be 😠👏 ignored, but 🤔 starts to 💦⏸ hurt at 💯 higher ✅ enrages.

.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1**__ ☄
⬥ Choose 📥📥 which 👏 path you 😖👶 want to 🍒 open 🎁 up by clicking on the web blocking it 🔫 at the start 💯😩 of 🅱 the 👩👏 fight. The 👏😱 web will burn for 👨⌛ 1 💸 minute.
⬥ Araxxor can do 3 different special 🏽💯 attacks this ❌ phase.
    • Cleave
    • Cocoon
    • Web Shield 💦
⬥ Araxxor cannot 😡⚠ be 👏 killed. 🗡 He 😎 will 😜 revive to 5,000 🖐🔝 HP whenever he goes down 🚃 to 0HP.
    • If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2.
        - If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2.
        - If doing middle path, you can work on stacking Storm Shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> for later in the fight.
        - If 💲👏 doing 🏿 bottom ⬇ path, 🛣🛣 there 💍👌 is 🚫 no ⛔🌈 setup that 👫 can make 👊 it 😧 faster.

        - Minion 💩 Spawn
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield
    • The goal 🙍 of 🔴💰 this phase is 👏🖍 to 😈 simply ⤵⤵ do ♂ damage ☠ while 👶 being mindful of special ☄💯 attacks.
        - Utilizing Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> can help with burst damage.
    • You 🤖 can 💦 go directly ➡ from 💥😂 phase 🌒🌑 2 🏿 to phase 🌓 3 whenever you 👆 want by 😡😈 running down 👅⬇ the 🍃 hallway.
        - It 👁☝ is recommended to 😔💦 go 🏃 from 👉 phase 👏🌑 2 😰💦 to 💰 phase 🌗 3 🎆😘 sometime 😘 after 👀😩 the 👏 Egg 🥚 Bomb 💣💦 special ✈🏽 attack, but before 🔙 the 😹🔴 next special attack so 😍💦 minion spawns don't 🙈😡 get 🉐 lost ❌💯 when you 👼 start 🆕 going 🏃 towards ⛪ phase 🌔🌘 3. 🎆❤

.
⬥ **Middle 🖕 Path** 🛣
    • Phase 2 🕔 starts 🕹↔ when 😩 you 👦 run 😩 through ⏬😩 the barrier the 🏼 burning 🔥 web was 🙂 blocking. ⛔

        - Egg Bomb 💣💥
        - Instakill Spider
        - Cleave
        - Web Shield
    • The 👏💪 goal of this 🔊 phase is 💰🙀 to ♂ lure Araxxor into the large 😵 acid 💦💦 pool, 🌊🌊 let 👀 him 😂 absorb 😵 enough 👏🤙 acid, 💦 and 🙏 then 💯 drag him 😱 up the 👏 platform until he 👨👈 starts burning 🔥 it. ☔💯
        - Araxxor needs 🙌🙏 to have absorbed at 👉😤 least 🚫 55% acid 😛 to 💰💦 ensure 💰 he 🦁 fully burns the 👉 platform and opens up phase 🌘🌒 3. ❤
        - Araxxor checks 📚✔ to 👏💦 see 👁 if 👩👏 he is 🅱😍 standing 🔪 in the 🌐💦 acid 😛 every 👏 10 ⬆ ticks (6 👏 seconds) 🕥 before starting 🍆🤠 to 👏 absorb 😵😵 it. 😡😂 There 👌🚬 is 🔥 a 🎓 setup guide for this 👏🏻 down 🚃😂 in 😩 the 🔮 advanced section 📦 for Middle 👈 Path 🛣 which can 🔫 save 6 seconds 🕥 in a 🅱 kill. 🔫
        - When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3.

.
⬥ **Bottom 👇⬇ Path**
    • Phase 🌘👏 2 starts 🕹 when you run 🏃😭 through the 🍗 barrier the 🚑 burning web was 🅰 blocking.

        - Egg 🥚🥚 Bomb 💦
    • The 💦 goal of this 🏻💻 phase 🌒 is 👏 to 💰➡ chase the light 🕯💡 spots around 😫🍆 the 🔥 hallway to avoid 🙅 damage while waiting ⌚⌚ for 👏😩 Araxxor to 😘 charge at 🍆🍆 you, ✈😂 causing a 😭 cutscene and 🏿👏 prompting you 👨👶 to 🔢 dodge it. 💡
        - If you 👈🏾 dodge the charge, the wall ⌨⌨ breaks and 👏👏 phase 3 💯😗 opens up. 🍅🔺
        - If ♂ you fail to ➡ dodge the ☝ charge, you will 💰 take damage ☄☠ and need 😩✅ to wait 🏽 for another ♂🏻 charge.
        - The following infographic shows 📺📺 all 🛑 four possible 🔝🔝 movements.
.
    • It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility.
        - Position 🙏🙏 your 🏼🍆 character to 😏💰 always 💯⏰ face ⬅👿 the 😦 longer 😒😒 part of 🔥 the 🕵⌛ hallway. this 👉 lets 👈 you surge straight ➖ and 😍⚠ then 💓 have 🙋 control over 🙊⤵ where you 🎩 bladed dive ahead 🚨 of 💦📰 you 👉🤖 from 💓 there, ⛱✔ making 📉 it 🗨 easier to reach the 😟 light quickly. ⏰ If 👏🏼 the 💡 light 💡 spawns 🤑 behind you, you 👈❔ can 💦💦 simply bladed dive to ➡💦 it.
    • Prayer can 🔫 be conserved on bottom ⬇ path by 😈😆 turning it off since you 👩👦 won't 💪 be attack ⚔🤼 anything 🅱🚫 besides the ⏩ occasional 🅱🅱 minion 👄 and 💨 you 💦👈 can 🔫 just 👏♀ prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. 😳😳 
    • You 👉 can 🔫 conserve food 🍔🍝 by 😀😈 using 📤🏻 resonance on 💰 Araxxors range/mage 🤤 attack whenever possible.
*Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage relic can also help with this.*

__**Phase 3**__ 🥜❤
⬥ **All 🔎💂 Paths**
    • Phase 🌗 3 starts 🕹 when you enter 💦🍆 the 👊 back 😻😔 end of the 🚧 arena.
    • Araxxor will heal up ☝ to ♂💦 80% of the 💪📜 leftover health he ⛈ had 💦 from 😮 phase 1 ⚡♂ and 2. 🏻

        - Generally it is best do a Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotation to finish the phase ASAP.
 
.
__**Phase 4**__ 😘
⬥ **All Paths**
    • Phase 🌕 4 starts 🕹↔ after you 🤔👈 kill Araxxor in 👉 phase 3.
        - There will 👏📃 be a cutscene and Araxxi will 🚫👏 be 🅱📖 the 🌃👏 enemy of 💦💦 the last phase.
    • The 😫 goal ⚽😫 of 💦 this ❓ phase 🌗 is 🏳😦 to kill Araxxi.
    • Araxxi Can 🔫 do 💯 3 🔀❤ different mechanics while 🕑 she is 😜 above 50k hp (no special ✈✌ attacks happen 💁 below 😫😫 50k hp).
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield ⚗
    • Araxxi can fight with 👏 all 💯🏼 3 👏 combat 🗡 styles.
        - If 😩☝ player 👨🤷 is in melee distance, Araxxi will 👏 use 👏🎮 Melee or 💰🥖 Magic attacks at random. 🎲🎲
        - If 🏼 player 💰 is 🔥 not in melee distance, Araxxi will use Ranged or 😇 Magic 📿✨ attacks, whichever the ❄ player 📅 is 🔥🍏 currently NOT praying 🙏🙏 against 🔫 at 🤠 the time ‼ of 👅😤 attacking. 🤼🤼
    • From 😂👉 50k to 💦💦 25k hp, Araxxi hits 🎯 harder 🔩🍆 and faster, 🔥🚀 and 👏💰 takes 💜💜 reduced damage ☄ from 💥 the player 🤷🤷
    • At 🕛👌 25k hp, Araxxi drains ⌛ your 👉👏 adrenaline 💉💉 by 50% and 🤖⏲ summons an acid 💦 core 💰 that 🐑🚟 bounces around 💦 the ☀ arena.
        - Araxxi takes full 👏🈵 damage ☠☄ again 😭♀ once 💦 reaching 25k hp.
        - The 🅱 acid 😝 core 💰 will deal high damage ☠☠ if it 💋😠 touches the player. If 🤔👻 it does 😳 this, 😀🕓 move 🔛🏃 one ☣💦 tile to 💦 make 💆🖕 it start 💦🎮 bouncing around 🕤🔹 again. 🤤😦
*Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you.*

*Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: <https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc>*

    • This phase is ❤ timegated so 🙇😫 it can 🔫 be 🐝💄 used 📅 to set 📚 yourself ♂ up 😍😍 for phase 😶 2 🙊 while 👱 you deal damage.
        - Use Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and build adrenaline so you are ready to Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> when the web burn reaches 50-55%.
        - Build adrenaline to 90%+ and use a dragon battleaxe special attack <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>.
        - Build adrenaline again and use a Zaros Godsword special attack <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> at ~80% web burn.
        - Build adrenaline 💉 one ☝ more 😖 time, stop 🤔 attacking ♂ around 92% web burn and run 🏃 to 💱👸 the 💦 web. finish 🏁🏁 building 🏗🏗 adrenaline with defensives if 🤔👏 you 🤗 need. ✅👌
    • Phase 🌒🌗 into ➡ phase 🌒 2 👫🏿 asap.

.
⬥ **Phase 2** 🕝👀
    • Immediately <:gbarge:535532879250456578> with the Mobile perk → <:destroy:535532879330148352>.
    • The 😈😊 rest 💯😊 of Phase 2 depends 🔁🙌 on 🔛 when 🍑😂 Araxxor uses 🆒🆒 a 👌🔝 special 👾 attack (it ➡ will 🅱 always 👉 be 🅰👬 Egg Bomb).
        - <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:slaughter:535532879237873666>
        - Abandon the rotation and start running to phase 3 no matter how far in you were when the Egg Bomb special attack happens. maximizing time before a special attack is more important than doing extra damage on phase 2. Use <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> to get to phase 3 quickly
        - Optional: Use a Powerburst of Acceleration <:accel:756236265472524418> when Araxxor does the Egg Bomb spec to get to phase 3 even faster. To do this you will do <:surge:535533810004262912> <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> <:bd:535532854281764884> (the last Surge should take you into phase 3, and then you can use the last Bladed Dive to get closer to rax back in the Phase 2 tunnel). This can save a couple seconds of time during the run from phase 1 area to phase 3.
    • Build to 100% adren with defensives while running to phase 3. You'll want to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> a couple seconds before you reach phase 3 so you can build some extra adrenaline for phase 3.

    • Once 😩💦 you 👈 start 🎮👣 phase 🌑 3, 👏😭 run 🏃🏃 back 😡 towards ⛪⛪ rax and follow 👣 this rotation:
        - <:terramaul:602561894829522954> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:deci:535532879325822986>

⬥ **Phase 🌑 1**
    • Remember to stack Storm Shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> with <:terramaul:602561894829522954>
        - You 👉 should try to 🍆💦 apply 😤 a Shard at 💯 the ⭐👏 very 👍❗ start 🎮🍆 and 👏 every 🕤👏 time as 🖕🍑 soon ⌛ as 👨🏻 it 😠 comes 💦😩 off 💦 cooldown.
    • Walk 🏼🏼 Araxxor so 👉❓ he 👨 is 😂 right against 😲🔫 the 👏💻 web (see 😎 below ⬇ about 😝♂ how 🅱 to walk phase 😶 1). 👀
    • Below ⬇ is a diagram to help with positioning Araxxor on 👅🅱 P1 (Camera 📹📷 facing 😫 east): 🌍🌍
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/KtRYknU.jpg
.
        - The yellow 🍋💛 line 👦🙋 is 💦 the 👀 line to stand 🚶 on 💦 after ⏳🅱 walking Araxxor, if you 👵 move 1 more square east, 🌍🌍 Araxxor will 👏 run 🏃🏃 into the 💌 web and 🎅 start going ▶🏃 west again 🏼💦 which 👏👌 could ❌ ruin the 👏 setup. If 🏃👩 you 👼💻 have 🔒🙌 trouble finding 🏼🔍 this 🙄🏻 spot 💓 just 😩✔ keep in 👮🌤 mind 🤔 you 🚫 must stand 1 ☠ east of 😝 the 🤡📜 line 👦🙋 where the 🖇👏 skulls are (circled in 👏🎁 red).
    • At 99% web burn you can Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into phase 2.
        - You'll know if you 🤔 did 🙀👏 it 💡💤 correctly if Araxxor starts 🕹 absorbing the acid 😛💯 at 🗽💯 1:06 👂⚖ rather 🙇 than 👉👨 the 👩💰 standard 1:12. This 😎👏 can 🔫🤔 be 🎄 delayed if 😂👏 Araxxor does ☝🏋 a 💰🌍 special 😂 attack right 🍅 before 🍆⏪ the web finishes burning.
    • Here 😇 is 📆 a 👭😠 video 🏼 example 🔥 on 🚟 walking Araxxor in 🌍🏡 phase 😶 1: 🕴

.
⬥ **Phase 🌑 2**
    • Run across 👌💰 the 💚🏠 acid 😛😛 pool 🌊🌊 and ♀ stall a 📢💰 shard. Run ♂ up 👆🍕 3 tiles onto the 👏🌊 platform. This 👈 puts 😍 rax as far 👉💶 up 👀🤢 the path as 👂 he 👉😎 can 😫💦 be 🐝👏 while 👶 still 😻 absorbing acid. 💯😛
        - Below ⬇😫 is 🅱 a 😼👏 picture 💩💭 of 💦🎆 how far 💦😩 up 👀 the ramp to 💦 stand for 👦 this 👈💦 lure:

    • Deal damage and remember to keep applying <:StormShards:536256663641128971> with <:terramaul:602561894829522954>.
    • When Araxxor has absorbed 53% acid, you can <:bd:535532854281764884> <:surge:535533810004262912> up the platform, then walk 1 tile west so you have room behind you to dodge Cleave special attacks.
        - You'll 😁😵 know you 👈👧 timed this 👉⬆ correctly 🤗 if Araxxor's acid absorption goes 💯 up to ✌💦 55% then starts dropping, and you'll get 🤣 the 🅱💰 popup message that 👉😧 the 🙏💌 bridge is 🙈 burning 🔥 when 🍑 there 👌 is 🤔 49% acid left. This 👏👋 is 👏😈 the 🅱 perfect 💯 amount needed. 😫🤒
    • Set 📚🥝 up ↕ for 🎄😜 phase 3. 😗
        - Natural instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> timing is calculated based on how much acid Araxxor has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> when the bar says 24-19%.
    • build 🏠🏠 to 100% and prepare 👏👏 for 🍆🔄 phase 🌑🌑 3. ❤💦

.
⬥ **Phase 🌔🌔 3** 😭
    • <:terramaul:602561894829522954> <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> as you are jumping down the ramp → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:Shatter:536256673904328704> → <:cleave:535532878616985610>

**__How to losslessly get 5 Storm Shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on Araxxor before Phase 3__**
⬥ Phase 1: 2 😞😲 shards
    • Use Storm Shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on Araxxor as your first ability on phase 1 when he becomes attackable, and use another <:StormShards:536256663641128971> as soon as it is off cooldown about halfway through phase 1.
⬥ Phase 🌕 2: 3 shards
    • Use Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> <:surge:535533810004262912> to get across the pool in phase 2 and stall a 3rd Storm Shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on Araxxor by using the ability out of range and clicking under you. Don't use any other abilities or you will lose the stalled shard. Once Araxxor starts absorbing acid you can click on him to release the stalled Storm Shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971>.
        - Stalling the storm shard like 🦊 this 🤔 gets 💪🙎 the 👏 cooldown timer ticking sooner so 💯👟 you 👏 can ☺💦 use another 2 shards losslessly.
    • Apply the 4th Storm Shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> just before you run up the platform when Araxxor has absorbed enough acid to burn the bridge (~53%)
    • Use the 5th Storm Shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> while waiting for the bridge to burn.

    • Spam 🔁 a defensive or 🍆💦 non-Mobile 🏆🏆 surge to gain 🔼 adren when 😩 the cutscene ends ♂ and 😤 drop 👇 a dummy. ❤
