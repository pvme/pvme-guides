> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
⬥ Araxxor is an Araxyte spider who lives in the Araxyte lair, a cave beneath the Haunted Woods, just south of Port Phasmatys. 
⬥ He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. 
    • When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base enrage values is used. 
        - This includes minion spawns and its strength in general.

.
⬥ The fight is heavily influenced by the player's choice. 
    • The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path opens. 
        - The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day.

.
⬥ Despite displaying a "None" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. 
    • Players carrying an Araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. 
        - For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. 
        - Simply creating an instance has the same effect as bringing a pheromone as well.

*Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks.*

.
> __**Drops**__
.tag:drops
His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements.

⬥ <:pheromone:643122483641188372>  **Pheromone** `1/(50-[Enrage/20])`
⬥ <:spiderlegtop:643122501521768491>  **Leg piece** `1/40 (1/70 in duo)`
⬥ <:araxxifang:643148203604049940>  **Hilt** `1/120  (1/200 in duo)`
⬥ <:araxyteegg:643149217313062913>  **Araxyte egg** `1/500 (200 threshold)`

.
*Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mage at Araxxor because it spawns the melee form of Araxxor which applies a typeless bleed to the player.*

.
> __**Presets**__
.tag:presets
__**Intermediate Preset**__
⬥ Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. 
⬥ A <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> will also help you keep your life points high. 
⬥ It is recommended to take salves or some other method of poison prevention, as the range version will repeatedly poison you reduce the antipoison timer.
⬥ Once food is easier to conserve, switch from a Pack Yak to a Nihil, Ripper Demon, or Kal'gerion Demon. As a meleer, <:berserker:643505116347105290> should be used when possible, and your highest tier <:brawler:643505376917979138> otherwise.

.
__**Experienced Preset**__
⬥ Once more seasoned at the boss, it is recommended to start incorporating a DW/2H switching rotation for more DPS output.
⬥ A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. 
⬥ If you want more consistency on killing each phase faster, use the Grimoire for Phases 2/3/4. 
⬥ If you want more efficient gp/hr, use Scrimshaw of Vampyrism. 
⬥ Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. Sailfish and brews can be used for panic eating. 
⬥ A Noxious Scythe can be brought for helping to AoE minions that may spawn when Path 1 is open, as well as to stay safe outside of melee distance on higher enrages as needed.
⬥ Zaros Godsword and Seren Godbow are brought for their respective special attacks.
⬥ <:yellowpouch:690848914949144616>  **Rune Pouch** <:Bloodrune:536252658970001409> <:Astralrune:536252658961481769> <:Bodyrune:536252659301089280>

.
> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
⬥ Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks
    • Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the 5th auto attack
        - While either of these abilities are up, the player will not pulled in by the cleave and the cocoon special attack will not last as long.
⬥ Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave.

.
__**Cleave**__
⬥ Araxxor pulls you in and hits the player with a large typeless hit unless the player can get out of the attack range.
    • With Melee and Magic, the player will always need to run away a few tiles to avoid this.
    • With Ranged, the player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to avoid being dragged in.

.
__**Cocoon**__
⬥ Araxxor Wraps the player in a cocoon, causing them to take damage every tick until they escape.
    • To escape, simply spam click.
    • The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> active before this special attack comes.

.
__**Web Shield**__
⬥ Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. 
⬥ This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. 
    • To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. 
    • This special attack can be used to gain some health back by using Resonance on your own hit, 
        - For melee, it is recommended to use Quake since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. 
        - For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. 
        - Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back.

.
__**Minion Spawn**__
⬥ Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each.
    • Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. 
    • Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly.
⬥ When path 1 is open, this special attack can occur on Phase 3/4
    • if Path 1 was taken, minions can also be spawned on Phase 2 
⬥ Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a Mirrorback or Pulsing. 
    • In the first wave, it's the **third** to spawn. 
    • In the second wave, it's the **second** to spawn.
    • In the third wave, it's the **first** to spawn.
    • There is no special spider in the fourth wave.

.
__**Egg Bomb**__
⬥ Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs and fire a slow moving projectile at you. 
    • To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. 
        - If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. 
        - If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage.
        - If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage
        - If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. 
        - If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb.

.
__**Instakill Spider**__
⬥ Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. 
⬥ The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. 
    • when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. 
    • If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. 
    • its speed is variable. 
    • To deal with this, you can either:
        - Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> or Immortality <:immort:535541258538582017> to negate the damage from the spider.
        - Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline.
        - Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so.

.
__**Acid Spiders**__
⬥ On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss.
    • To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor.
    • It is better to just ignore these spiders.
    • They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. 
    • The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. 
        - You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. 
        - If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path.

.
__**Light Spots**__
⬥ The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot.
    • This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. 
    • Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. 
        - On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.

.
> __**Overview of the Fight**__
.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1**__
⬥ Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight. The web will burn for 1 minute.
⬥ Araxxor can do 3 different special attacks this phase.
    • Cleave
    • Cocoon
    • Web Shield
⬥ Araxxor cannot be killed. He will revive to 5,000 HP whenever he goes down to 0HP.
    • If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2.
        - If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2.
        - If doing middle path, you can work on stacking Storm Shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> for later in the fight.
        - If doing bottom path, there is no setup that can make it faster.

.
__**Phase 2**__
⬥ **Top Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 5 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Egg Bomb (always the first mechanic on Phase 2)
        - Minion Spawn
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield
    • The goal of this phase is to simply do damage while being mindful of special attacks.
        - Utilizing Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> can help with burst damage.
    • You can go directly from phase 2 to phase 3 whenever you want by running down the hallway.
        - It is recommended to go from phase 2 to phase 3 sometime after the Egg Bomb special attack, but before the next special attack so minion spawns don't get lost when you start going towards phase 3.

.
⬥ **Middle Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 4 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Egg Bomb
        - Instakill Spider
        - Cleave
        - Web Shield
    • The goal of this phase is to lure Araxxor into the large acid pool, let him absorb enough acid, and then drag him up the platform until he starts burning it.
        - Araxxor needs to have absorbed at least 55% acid to ensure he fully burns the platform and opens up phase 3.
        - Araxxor checks to see if he is standing in the acid every 10 ticks (6 seconds) before starting to absorb it. There is a setup guide for this down in the advanced section for Middle Path which can save 6 seconds in a kill.
        - When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3.

.
⬥ **Bottom Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 2 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Light Spots (constantly active on this phase)
        - Egg Bomb
    • The goal of this phase is to chase the light spots around the hallway to avoid damage while waiting for Araxxor to charge at you.
        - The charge will cause a cutscene to happen that lets you choose a direction to dodge it.
            • If you dodge the charge, the wall breaks and phase 3 opens up.
            • If you fail to dodge the charge, you will take damage and need to wait for another charge.
            • The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements.
*Note: It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/8XrM5tg.jpg
.
Dodging the attack correctly will destroy the wall and let you into phase 3. failing it only destroys the wall 50%. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic can also help with this.

It is very beneficial to have bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it.

Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible.

.
__**Phase 3**__
During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs.
<:Berserk:513190158468907012> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → DPS (try to bleed a threshold with greater barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> buff for extra burst damage).
 
.
__**Phase 4**__
This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both range or mage attacks if you are not in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. If you are in melee distance, Araxxi will use either melee or mage attacks at random. It is recommended to camp melee prayer and flick to mage prayer when you see a mage attack, then back to melee again. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. She also takes 50% less damage from all hits from 50k-25k hp. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. It is best to kill the last 25k hp as fast as possible to avoid the acid core from ever touching you.

At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection. 
An example of this can be seen here: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc

__**Standing in Scythe Distance**__
In order to take advantage of the 2 tile range of halberds you must stand out of melee distance. This can easily be practiced anywhere, however for p4 there are some indicators which can help you.
Below is an image of "scythe range" for phase 4, with a recommended visual position.

.tag:advguides
`Top path`
**__Phase 1__**
    • This phase is timegated so it can be used to set yourself up for p2 while you deal damage
    • Use quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and build adren so you are ready to Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> when the web burn reaches 50-55%
    • Build adrenaline to 90%+ and use a dragon battleaxe spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • Build adrenaline again and zaros godsword spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> at ~80% web burn
    • Build adrenaline one more time, get off around 92% web burn and run to the web. finish adren building with defensives if you need.
    • Phase into p2 asap

.
**__Phase 2__**
    • Immediately <:gbarge:535532879250456578> in with the Mobile perk → <:destroy:535532879330148352>
    • The rest of Phase 2 depends on when araxxor uses a special attack (it will always be egg bomb).
     ▪︎ <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:slaughter:535532879237873666>
     ▪︎ Abandon the rotation and start running to phase 3 no matter how far in you were when the egg bombs spec happens. maximizing time before a spec is more important than doing extra damage on phase 2. Use <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> to get to phase 3 quickly
    • Optional: Use a <:accel:756236265472524418> when araxxor does the egg bomb spec to get to p3 even faster. To do this you will do <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> (the last surge should take you into Phase 3, and then you can use the last bladed dive to get closer to rax back in the Phase 2 tunnel). This can save a couple seconds of time during the run from Phase 1 to Phase 3.
    • Build to 100% adren with defensives while running to phase 3. You'll want to berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> a couple seconds before you reach p3 so you can build some extra adren for phase 3

**__Phase 3__**
    • You want to turn around in phase 3 as soon as you enter so it is good to learn where phase 2 ends and where phase 3 begins. Crossing the yellow line in this picture will start phase 3. Since you run 2 tiles at a time you can click back towards phase 2 just before you cross the line and your character should still cross it.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/QR0YouB.png
    • Once you start phase 3, run back towards rax and follow this rotation:
<:terramaul:602561894829522954> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:deci:535532879325822986>

.
`Mid path`
**__Phase 1__**
    • Walk araxxor so he is right against the web (see below about how to walk p1)
    • Remember to stack Storm Shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> with <:terramaul:602561894829522954>
    • At 99% web burn you can Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into phase 2
     ▪︎ You'll know if you did it correctly if rax  starts absorbing the acid at 1:06 rather than the standard 1:12. This can be delayed if rax does a spec right before the web finishes burning
    • Below is a diagram to help with positioning Araxxor on P1 (Camera facing east)
.img:https://i.imgur.com/KtRYknU.jpg
     ▪︎ The yellow line is the line to stand on after walking Araxxor, if you move 1 more square east Araxxor will run into the web and start going west again which could ruin the setup. If you have trouble finding this spot just keep in mind you must stand 1 east of the line where the skulls are (circled in red).
    • Here is a video example on walking Araxxor in P1: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k

.
**__Phase 2__**
    • Run across the acid pool and stall a shard. Run up 3 tiles onto the ramp. This puts rax as far up the path as he can be while still absorbing acid
.img:https://i.imgur.com/U49xswa.jpg
    • Deal damage and remember to keep stacking <:StormShards:536256663641128971> with <:terramaul:602561894829522954>
    • When rax has absorbed 53% acid, you can <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> up the ramp, then walk 1 tile west so you have room to dodge cleave specials at the top of the ramp
     ▪︎ You'll know you did this correctly if rax goes up to 55% then starts dropping, and you'll get the popup message that the bridge is burning when there is 49% acid left. This is the perfect amount needed.
    • Set up for phase 3
      ▪︎ Natural instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> timing is calculated based on how much acid rax has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would natural instinct when the bar says 24-19%.
    • build to 100% and prepare for p3
 
 **__Phase 3__**
    • <:terramaul:602561894829522954> <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> as you are jumping down the ramp → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:zgs:626465964325601290> → <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:Shatter:536256673904328704> → <:cleave:535532878616985610>

.
`How to losslessly get 5 storm shards <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on rax before Phase 3`
    • Use storm shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on rax as your first ability on Phase one when he becomes walkable, and as soon as it is off cooldown about halfway through Phase 1
    • Use Bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> to get across the pool in Phase 2 and stall a <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on rax by using the ability out of range and clicking under you. Don't use any other abilities or you will lose the stalled shard. Once araxxor starts absorbing acid you can click on him to release the stalled storm shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971>.
      ▪︎ Stalling the storm shard like this gets the cooldown timer ticking sooner so you can use another 2 shards losslessly
    • Use another storm shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> just before you run up the ramp when rax has absorbed enough acid to burn the bridge (~53%)
    • Use one more storm shard <:StormShards:536256663641128971> while waiting for the bridge to burn.
