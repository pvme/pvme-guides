**To Our Website Friends:**
This 🏻😩 channel is 🤔 out 🤣🏙 of 😎 date 👫 and there 😂 are no plans to 😂 update 📆💰 it 💦 as 😎 it 😂👏 is 😩❌ not linked in 👇👏 the 💻 discord. Any solak updates 🕹🕹 will be 👏🐝 in either 😤 Solak Mechanics 💰💰 or Solak Rotations.

.
> **Introduction**
The 👏😎 most recently 🕛 released 🔴 major 😳😳 boss 💼 in 🍆👌 RuneScape 3, 😏 Solak, has 👩 a duo and 👏👏 a 👏🔬 7man version that 😐🚟 scales accordingly. The 👏 7man version 👧 of 🌈💰 this boss 👨💼 has 🅰👏 8M hp.
Solak is 🌵 the 👏😩 first boss that 😩 has made 😶💰 hybrid a viable strategy, which results 🔢🔢 in 🕶👏 a ⌛ lot 🤣 of 👅🌈 interesting 🤔 ways 💫😉 to 💦 approach the 🅱👏 fight, as 💰🍑 well as 👉💰 a 🅱 lot 🤣🍑 of 👏 different 👱💰 rotations. Whilst 🎩🎩 camping one 🏼🙏 style is 💦😄 not 😡🙅 bad, 😭😩 utilizing two 🎄 styles will yield ⛔ the 🍑 best 😍👌 results, 🔢 as 🅰🍑 well as 🍑🍑 increase the 👩👏 killspeed overall, but mastering this 👈👈 can 🔊 be a bit difficult.

Recommended auras for 😩🏻 this 👏😞 fight. You 👼 have 💪😝 100% 💯💯 accuracy 👌🏹 at 👢👸 Solak (except 😮 roots on 🔛🏿 p1) which 👩 means ❄ you 😫👈 should 💘😑 utilize other 👈💦 auras instead of the accuracy boosting ones. 💯💯
For hybrid, the best aura goes as follows: <:mahj:643148943856762890> > <:dm:643505652571963417> > <:inspiration:643505652634746881> > <:invig:643505652865695767>
For one style camping, the best aura to use would be the respective zerker aura (<:mani:643505153709965322>/<:reckless:643505179378974748>/<:berserker:643505116347105290>), and then the other hybrid auras as mentioned earlier
If 👏 camping one 😱😤 style 😫 it ❔🙂 is recommended to 💦💦 use magic ✨📿 as 👦 it 🍆 gives you access to vulnerability and 😱 4TAA. However, 💰😐 this guide will 🍆💰 showcase a magic and 👌🗣 a 👌 ranged non-hybrid 🏆 7man preset. If 🏃 you’re 🙏🏻 planning to melee you 🗣😡 can just change 👎🆙 the 👏💦 gear to 🤔💦 match 👌😤 your 👈🏻 own.

    • Consider 🤔🤔 using 📤🤳 a 👻 Grimoire if you 👆 own 😎 one, 💍 as there 💍 is 🙀🔥 no 🔻 upkeep cost 📲 to using it 🖕😩 at Solak
    • Cinderbanes are 🙏😟 BiS 💍💯 at 😂👀 Solak (even 🕚🌠 for range), 🤤💦 as Solak is 🈶👏 poisonable, this stacks 💦 with 🍨 weapon poison 🤒
    • The 👥 4 🙇🙏 mines are 👏🏄 essentially 40k damage on the roots, 📚📚 making 💰🏽 you spend 💸 less 👎 time on 🔛🅱 them and enabling you to 💳💦 get back on 👋 Solak quickly
    • Switches are not 🖐 necessary but 😝🍑 highly 🔊 encouraged, ☺ as 🍑 they 👩👲 increase 💳 your ⏰🌼 DPS. Change 🔁🔀 preset accordingly to 💦 what ❓❓ you 👈 feel ✋ comfortable with. 🅱🙅 They 🏾 are not 😠❌ extremely important 🤣 if you 👈😣 are ♂💯 basing, although will help 💁😬 with 😶👏 clearing some 🔇 mechanics of the fight. 🤜💥
.
**Hybrid 7man preset** 

This 👈👇 preset is 😂 just 👌♀ a 😍💀 sample preset for 🍆 maximum efficiency, but 💁🍑 can 💰🔫 be 🍆 changed accordingly dependent on the person. This preset can 🔫 be ☮ changed depending on 🔛 whether 📊 you’re basing or 💁🤔 not. 🙅

**Note:** A grimoire is the BiS pocket slot item for hybrid. An update made it such that grimoire no longer has upkeep at Solak, therefore this is always the best option.

**__Pre-fight__**
        - Build to 💦💦 100% 💯 adrenaline 💉 outside of 👶 the 👏 arena
        - Start by placing two 💏💏 of your 😩 mines at 🍆🤡 the 😢 southmost root spawns, 🤑 three 🏾 DPSers on 🔛🔛 each 👋👋 side 🌟 (base 👺👺 can 💦🔫 choose whichever side)
.img:https://i.imgur.com/iaSSt6n.png
.tag:prefight
        - Prior to ♂ the fight, you 😭 must 😡🙅 discuss which root you 👺 will 👏💦 be 👦🐝 taking, 😂 it 🕥 can 😠 be any ♀ root except 😮 the two 💏💏 most southern ones. 
        - You 👊 must 👍 place 🏡 your ⛵🍆 mines on 🔛🙏 the 🍆⛓ same 🤢♂ tick otherwise only 🏻🕦 one 🙏☝ will go off.

First 👆🏻 we’ll 😮👥 go over the 🏙😍 attack 🤼🤼 rotation, and then into ⬇☔ detail on 🔛🔛 how 🏻🏻 to 💦😩 deal with 👏 them 🤷 accordingly.

.tag:phase1
**P1 fight breakdown**
Solak has 👏👏 8 👊✊ million 💯😂 hp. You 🏼😢 are 🍑 expected 😣 to 🔟 finish your 👨👉 sunshine/death ☀ swiftness/berserk before 🍆😲 getting 👏 onto roots. The 🏻 lower Solaks hp is 😧🌈 on 🔛😁 p1 before 🈳❄ root spawn, the ➡ better. 💦 This 🏿🔽 will increase the chance 🚫 of 😔😰 skipping a 👉 second root spawn (will get to ✌👏 this 👈 later). Roots 😇 are 😎 flankable from 😲💰 the 😂 North ☝ side. 🚔 Use 👏 your second 🅾 set 📚 of 😂🌊 dominion mines on 😢🏄 the roots, as they’ll deal 20k damage ☠ to one ♿☝ of 😤💦 them.
After 👀 initial 💰 boss start, 🅱 green 🤢😁 pads will spawn.

.
After 👊 this attack, finish your 👨 ultimates and go 🏃 to 💦😥 your respective root. During this 👀👇 root attack, 🤼 two random 🔀🎰 playes will get 🉐 a deadly root that 🔍 will stun and deal rapid 2k damage ☠ to 💦💰 anyone ♂👩 standing 🔪 ontop of 😂 them. ❤😉 You 😡🔱 have 😤 anywhere between 😉 7 to 🙅♂ 13 seconds 🕞🕞 to 🎀 deal with 😭👯 this. 🤠👈 This 👏 is 🅱🍅 completely 😣🙌 random. 🔀 To 😔 deal with 😍 this attack, ⚔ surge/bladed dive to 👉 the 💥👉 arrow 💘💘 that spawns 🤑🤑 with 🏢😂 the 🕘👏 root, use freedom and 👅👌 run 🏃🚴 out a ✋😩 second 🅾⏱ or two 💏💏 before 💰🍑 root spawn. Make 💆👏 sure no 🚫 one 😨 is standing 🏿🏿 on top 🔼🔝 of 💦 the 💯 roots. 

After 👀🅰 this 🚟 attack, ⚔⚔ everyone should 💘💘 get 🉐 back 🏃👅 on 🔛 Solak. Make 💰 sure 😉✔ every 👏👏 root is 🙀 dead, otherwise blight lashers will spawn, dealing 2k+ range 🤤 damage ☄ per 👼👼 hit. 
Get 💰 back 😤🏃 on 😥 Solak, your 👉🍔 goal 🙍🙅 now is to 🅱👉 get 🉐 Solak as 🍑 low 🔽 as 🏼 possible, 🔝🔝 to 💦🤣 ensure 👌👌 no ✌ repetition of p1 specs. 

Solak will 👊 spawn three 👨 blight bombs 💣 on random 🎲🎲 DPSers. He 🤖🙀 will 💯 do ✔👉 this twice. After ⏳😏 the second 🅱✌ blight bomb, he 😨👦 will 🙏👀 phase 👏 into his 🚹 arms, which both have 👨⚠ around 🕦 120k hp. Once 💯 these 📄 have 👏👌 been ✊ dealt with, 👯🎃 he 👨 will 💰😜 phase 🌑🌒 into 😩 legs. 💪👄 After 💯⏳ the 👏🏿 legs, 💦 a 🏫👌 blight core 💰💰 will spawn with 😍 1 million 💯💯 hp. Deal as 👦 much damage ☠☠ to 💦 this 🍆 as possible. 🔝 Depending on 🔛😩 whether you’re 🏿 hybrid 🐕🐕 or 💰 camping one 😬 style, 🍌 use berserk or 💁 your 👩👏 respective style ultimate and deal as 💯🤔 much ✋ damage possible 🔝 to 💦 the 👄 core. Phase 👏 one 👏 will 🍡 end once the 👏 core 💰 is dead. 💦
.
**Note:**
        - The 👏 dps threshold 🤝🤝 for 🎄⚠ 7man Solak on 🔛 P1 is 6M hp
        - It is possible 🔝🔝 to repeat every 🔪😤 p1 mechanic, if 🎅👀 phase 🌘🌕 hp is not 🌪 met after 👅⏳ first 🏻 core. 
        - The rotation will restart from 👉 green pads until phase 🌑 hp as 🍑🏿 been ✊ met, after that, 👉 you 👈 have 👏😭 to 😆👉 deal with 💥👐 arms/legs 💯 until core 💰💰 is dead. 😵
        - If at 💰👉 any 📨💦 point 👉👉 Solak reaches 6M HP, his 👉🛏 next attack ⚔ will 😠 be the arms/legs. This is why it is crucial to do 👌🚫 as much 💘😩 damage as 🕐 possible 🔝🔝 on P1
        - It 😽 is 🙀😜 possible to 💦👁 skip blight bombs 💣💣 P1 if you 🙅👶 hit 👉🏼 the 💰🚽 DPS threshold 🤝 (6M hp) before 🔙❄ the bombs.
        - Using bladed dive on 💰🔛 a pad resets the cooldown of 💰 it, enabling you to use 💁👏 it 🔥🍆 again ❌😳

**__Solak P2 attack rotation__**
Eruptions
Anima bombs 💣 (weak 😤 at 😎👸 first but hits progressively harder 😍🔩 at 💦👢 the ♨ end) 🔚😂
(alongside anima bombs, 💣 Solak will 😩 do 👌 12 🕛🤓 autos before doing 🅰😧 next 😸📅 mechanic)
Blight rain ☔🌧 (5 ✋🛐 hits)
(alongside this rain, ☔🌧 Solak will do 7 🔥 autoattacks)
Pulling root attack 🤼 
Blight rain ☔ (5 hits) 🎯
Hurricane
Roots 🛐✝ x2 (alongside blighbombs, kind of 💦 how ❓ it 😝 works 👷 on 🔛🔛 p1)
Blight rain (5 hits) 💥
(Solaks attack rotation will ⚽ go 🏾🏃 back 😻🔙 to 👉🏽 anima bomb and repeat every 👖 mechanic in ➡👈 p2 except 😮😮 eruptions)
.tag:phase2
__**P2 fight ✊😫 breakdown:**__

**As DPS:**
Surge southwest as the core dies. ⚰ Every team 🏃 member ⓜ🍆 should be 😡🐝 killing 🔪🔪 the 👏 southwest eruption. Merethiel should 💦 be 👌🐝 clickable now. 👌 As 🅱 soon ⏰💰 as ☠ you 😏 can, cleanse on 🏽🐫 merethiel, activate the cleansing mechanic whilst killing the 🏠 eruption. As 👉🍑 the 👏 eruption dies, cleanse 🛁🛁 at 😎 merethiel, and 👏🏽 then 🏿😒 surge back to the 🦉 dead 😥 eruption. Utilize surge and 👎 bladed dive as 🏻 much 😩😩 as 🖕😎 possible. 🔝 (NOTE: 🗒 Some experienced teams will 💩 have 😤 a 👏 designated NW role on 🔥👋 p2, all 🌎 this 😎🍆 role does 👏 is kill 💀😩 the NW eruption and 👏 attack solak, and nothing else.) Do NOT miss ✋ a 👌 cleanse, 🛁🛁 as 👦 this can 💦 seriously 😒 damage ☄☄ your 🤣🏻 team depending on how severe the 🤔👌 damage ☠ on 🔛↕ the 🔴🤔 blightstorm is. 💦😯 Remember 💭🤔 to let 👌 your team know 🤓 if 👏👏 you’ve missed 😢😢 the 🤣 blight. 
As 🅰🍑 eruptions die, every dpser should go 😜🏻 to ⬆ the 🎅💌 most northern 🎅🎅 stairs in the 🏥 arena

.
This 🏻 spot ⏺ is least 🚟 likely to 👏 get hit by 💕 bombs but do keep 🏿👏 in mind 🤔 that ☃🌈 bombs can 🔫🅱 STILL hit 😪 here. 🈁 
When 😩 the anima bomb 💣💦 attack is 🤢 over, 🛩 Solak will 👏🙋 prepare 💋 to 👪 do 👌💃 his 💦 blight rain. One dpser grabs the nature 🌴🍃 blessing (yellow shield ⚗ dome) and 💰 places 🍆 it 👍😤 when solak puts 😍😍 his 🦊👦 hands down. Solak will 👏🙈 deal hard 🍆 hitting blight damage ☄ outside 🚪 the dome (around ↪👥 7-8k) So 🚟😖 its 👇😆 important ❌ that you STAY 👏 inside 😫👆 the ⏰👏 dome, as 😖🅱 his 👉🏻 damage will 💍👏 be 😐 reduced greatly.
Solak will 👀 do 👨 his pulling root attack, stunning and 💦 binding one 😤😬 random member of 🔴💰 the 👭👅 team, 💰🏃 and instakilling them ♂🎊 if 👦👏 they do 😱 not move ☝ out 😧 of 💦💦 his attack. 🤼🤼 This attack can be 👦 easily 😃 avoided if 🎅 you use freedom and ✊ move 🏃 away. 💨🏻 You 💦 can 🛢🔫 also 🙇🅱 use 👏🏾 anticipation prior 🔙🔙 to 💦🏻 the attack, 🤼🤼 to 💦💦 avoid it 🔥😉 completely. During 🏃 this ⬆😆 attack, ⚔ depending on 🔛 your 👯 role ⚽ in 😅 P3 (We 👉 will 👏 get 💪🔟 into this later 🕑 in 🌞 the 🍆💞 guide) you will 🤗👏 use 👏 either berserk or 💀💰 Sunshine/Deaths’ ☀☀ swiftness (only 💵 for 🚦😘 HYBRID). 👱👱 If 🙄 you’re 👏💖 style camping, disregard this completely.

.
After this 😎 attack, ⚔ he will use 👏😂 his blight rain attack ⚔ again. Deal with ➡ it the 👏 same way. ➡ This 🎅😀 is 😍 where 😾♂ the 🏻💦 fight can vary for a lot 🤣🤣 of people. A 👌 fast 💨 team 💰 will 👏😮 either phase 🌒 before the blight rain 🌧 or 😫💯 during 🚣🚣 the blight rain. 🌧⛈ For slower teams, you 👉👈 will 🎤👮 encounter the 🅰🌊 hurricane mechanic, which 👏 can 💁 easily 😃😃 decimate the team 🏃 if 👩💲 you are 😩♀ not prepared. If 🔎 your 💦🍆 corruption percentage under 🔕 solaks hp is 🅱👶 still 🕞 fairly high 🌲 during second blight rain, quickly ⏰⏰ build 🏭🏭 to 💸 the 👏 barricade ability. 👉 As 🍑👦 Solak is about 💦💦 to do 💕 his hurricane mechanic, quickly use 👏 barricade to 😵👏 block all 🌞 damage. ☠
.
The following mechanics should 😫😀 never happen, 💁💁 no matter team 💰💰 but 😠 I decided 🤔🤔 to 💦 put 👏 them 😀👸 in anyways in case 👅👅 some ☃🐺 teams lose 😱😱 a ➡👹 lot of 🌊🛢 members 👦👦 and 👏 for 💰 some 🖤 reason decide 😱😱 to 👀 continue. 🔁🔁 
Solak will do 🏻😍 a blight bomb similar 👱 to his P1, but 🍑 will also 👨➕ place some roots in 🍆👏 front of 💰 him, however 🤔 these ❌ are ⚛ very easy to avoid, 🙅 as 🏿🛠 you can 😫 just 🗣 walk ♀🚶 behind Solak. He 😩🙀 will 👊 do ❌ this twice before doing 🅰 his 🅱 third 🤔🤔 rain ⛈ attack, ⚔ after 💦 this 🚮⬇ he 🏽 will repeat all his mechanics 💰💰 except 😮😮 his 🥐 eruption mechanic.

.
**As Base:**
Basing is 💦👏 a 🅰🅰 bit different. On ⬇🔛 P2 Start, 🍆🎮 instead of 💦 going 🏃 south 👇 with 👏 the 💓 DPSers, you want 🙍👨 to 😢🏻 go 🏃🤔 NE and 🏻💰 kill the 👏♂ eruption alone. 🙀 Once 🅱 eruption is 🍵👉 dead, 👻👦 attack ⚔⚔ solak again. 🏼 It 🙀😂 is important ✅🤣 that 👇👊 you 👧👉 line 〰 solak up so the 🖕 DPSers can 😤 flank it. 😂🍆 This 👉 is 💦🅱 very 👌 easy for 🍆 you, as 💎😱 all 💯 the 🏼👏 dpsers will 💦😡 stand 💨🏾 north ☝💈 at 🍆👉 the 🕰 stairs, so 👉🔫 you 👦 can 🔊💦 stand ⛱ south 👇👇 of 😳💿 them with 👐 Solak.
.
As 🤔 base, 😵😵 you will have 😤😝 to ♂💦 avoid 🙅 anima bombs a 💡🅰 bit more 💴💹 frequent. Remember 😎😎 to 🔣💦 not run 🏃 completely 😍 off 🤤 with Solak, as 🅰🍑 this 🔥🏾 could 🚅 pull 💦😣 team 💰💰 members 👦👦 with 🤤👏 you, and ➕👏 killing 🔪 them 😊 in 🌙👇 the 🏻 process. 🏭 
During 🏃🏃 the blight rain, the base 👺😿 will grab and 🥜 place 😂 his 👨 own 🤢 nature 🌿🍁 blessing (yellow 🍌💛 shield dome) to 💦 let ❌ DPSers flank Solak.
When ♂🍑 Solak does his 👉 pulling root attack, 🤼⚔ he 👉 will 😩 place his 🙏🥐 arm 👌👌 on 🏿 the 🌾⚕ ground. 🔝 The 🔥 base will 👏😠 climb ♀♀ on 🔛🔛 this 👏🤗 arm 👌 (still 😽 dpsing solak) and 🌈😏 take a 💰 huge melee hit 💪 that 😐➡ hits 🎯💥 around 🐋✈ 8k. This is a 👌 melee hit 😤😤 that 😤💲 you can use ❌👏 resonance or devotion on. 🙏🔛 The 👨 rest 😊 of 🤤 the fight is 😍😯 the same 👬👬 for dps and 👏👨 base, 😵😢 with 🎃👏 another 📺👣 blight rain ☔⛈ and ⬆⬆ hurricane.
.
**__Note__**
    • The moment you 👈 hit 👊 0% 🕒😊 corruption, P3 will ⚽🅱 start. 🏁⏸
    • The 💦🆘 rotation will ⚽ restart from 👈 anima bombs 💣 if 😱😂 not 🚫❌ at 0% corruption
    • You CAN resonance the 🤜😫 hurricane and 🏽💦 blight rain 🌧 hits, 💥 although you have to time ⏰⏳ the 👏🏥 blight rain hit 👊😤 res, as 🕑 a 💰 range 🤤 hit 🎵🏼 will hit 👊👉 just 🙏👌 before the ⛓ blight rain 🅱 hit.
    • If 👏 on 🔛 a 💰 slow team 💰 and 👏 you 🅱🎤 struggle 😣 with 😂👏 phasing before ⏪ hurricane, you 🐶👉 can 🅱💦 shatter during 🏃 arm 👌 climbing.
