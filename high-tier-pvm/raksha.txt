> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro

Raksha is a dinosaur dubbed the "Shadow Colossus" which is located in Anachronia. Raksha can be fought either solo or duo, with linear hp scaling for duo mode. The drop rates for duo are also exactly the same as solo.
.

> __**Unlocking Raksha**__
.tag:unlock
⬥ Complete the miniquest: Raksha, the Shadow Colossus.
      •Slayercape tele to Laniakea, speak to her about the door at the top of the ruins.
      •Go through all the dialogue, then head to the south west, siphon the purple stuff (Takes like 1 minute).
      •After siphoning the purple stuff, head in through the door and space bar through dialog; miniquest complete.

.
> __**The Fight**__
.tag:fight
Raksha has a total HP of 800K in solo mode and 1.6M in duo. Raksha phases every 200K HP in solo mode and 400K HP in duo mode. 
Throughout the fight, Raksha uses all 3 combat styles to attack a player, but only uses magic or range when the player is not in melee distance. Raksha will also try to move closer to the player if they are not in melee distance.
Raksha does a special attack every 4 auto attacks. The special attacks used are pre-defined based on a set order in a phase.
Throughout the fight, shadow anima pools (commonly knows as shadow anima blobs) will spawn. Raksha will continously absorb the shadow anima pools, shown below Raksha's HP bar. The shadow absorption increases the damage Raksha deals to the player and reduces the damage it takes from the player. The player will need to kill these shadow anima pools in order to prevent Raksha from absorbing them.

Raksha's whole attack rotation throughout the fight can be summarised in the image below.

.
> **__Special Attack Information__**
.tag:spec
__**Tail Swipe**__
Raksha will do a Tail Swipe special attack if the player is in Raksha's melee distance. Raksha does a spin animation and hits a 3 square radius around it. Players will get stunned and hit around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, move 2 squares back from scythe distance. Alternatively you can <:escape:535541258832052231> or <:bd:535532854281764884>. Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes <:antitheism:787523880281047040>, which disables protection prayers.

.
__**Charge**__
Raksha will do a Charge special attack if the player is not in melee distance. Raksha charges towards the player, stunning them and hitting around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, players will need to move sideways. Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes <:antitheism:787523880281047040>, which disables protection prayers.

.
__**Shadow Bomb**__
The Shadow Bomb will stun a player and a Shadow Bomb will fall from the sky, marked by a target on the ground. If the Shadow Bomb hits the player, they are inflicted with the <:antitheism:787523880281047040> debuff, preventing them from using protection prayers and deflection curses. This special attack can be avoided by using either <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> prior and moving 2 tiles out of the shadow bomb's target area.

.
__**Mind Poison**__
Raksha spawns 2 - 4 shadow orbs near the player, each dealing 600 damage every few ticks until expelled by clicking. If not expelled, they explode for 2,000 - 3,000 damage each.

.
__**5X Shockwave**__
The 5X shockwave consists of 5 mage hits on the player. When Raksha uses the Shockwave special attack he will gain enrage from all the currently alive shadow anima blobs. Players can use <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> <:devo:513190158728953857> to mitigate the damage from this special attack.

.
__**Erebus Charge**__
A blue dome surrounds Raksha while he stops attacking and an extra action button appears on the screen. Players will need to deal a minimum of 10,000 damage to break the dome. As the dome explodes, fragments of shadow anima will be scattered throughout the arena. The total damage needed to break the dome depends on how much shadow anima was absorbed in phase 1 - 3. If the player does not destroy the dome, they can hide behind the pillars instead. After the dome has been destroyed, players can pick up the shadow anima scattered throughout the arena and click the action button to gain 10% extra damage per shadow anima collected.

.
__**Shadow Manifestation Minions**__
Raksha will spawn a 10,000 HP minion for each player. Shadow Manifestations will hit players with a melee attack and if left for too long, will perform a frenzy special attack, rapidly hitting players with melee hits and applying an armour break of 1% per stack.

.
__**Rockfall**__
Rockfall occurs as a transition special attack between phases 1-3. During the rockfall, 5x5 rocks will spawn every tick, prioritising the current player location. However, if there already is a rock above the player, it will spawn in a random area in the arena. When Raksha uses the rockfall special, 8 anima blobs spawn in the arena. More than 8 anima blobs will spawn in the arena if the shadow absorption rate is more than 0%.

.
__**Shadow anima pools**__
During the fight Raksha will spawn Shadow anima pools (commonly referred to anima pools/blobs/piles.) after the spin/charge special and the rockfall special. Raksha will absorb from these when he uses the Shockwave special attack, or if they are left alive too long in phase 3. Each anima pool has 1000 health and they spawn in 4 different areas in the arena. These must be dealt with right before the Shockwave attack or phase 3. **If not dealt with Raksha will gain enrage which gives Raksha healing, damage increase, damage reduction and the Shield on Phase 4 will require more damage to break.**

.
**__Shadow Anima__**
On Phase 4 Raksha will do the __Erebus Charge__ attack. During this attack Raksha will be shielded and dealing damage to the shield drops anima around the arena, destroying the shield will spawn a lot of anima compared to damaging the shield. Anima can be collected by running into the pickup range (5x5). Collecting anima will give you Inner Power stacks. Inner power stacks give the player a 10% damage increase per stack when activated. Inner power can be activated by using the extra action button. When the extra action button is used Inner Power will grant you the damage boost from all the stacks for 30s, during this time you **cannot** collect more anima.
.

> __**Ranged rotation for solo**__
.tag:ranged
Note: This is an advanced rotation assuming you own most of the high level gear (including new gear like fleeting boots), and will not help achieve a first kill. The goal kill times are 2:25-2:40. Kill times vary a lot due to the RNG of ranged with bolt procs. This rotation doesn't use Ecb EoF. This guide assumes you follow the exact bolt switches mentioned until a bolt is mentioned again. Improvising Bolt switches around bolt procs is assumed. Using <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> <:grico:787904334812807238> If <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> are on cd is assumed.

> __**Tips for the fight:**__
.tag:tips
⬥ Kill times vary a lot and sometimes you will get specials you normally skip, pay attention to the phases hp and adapt accordingly.
⬥ Vuln bombs are easy to use during the rockfall special because Raksha will not move.
⬥ Spamming ripper demon specials is important to phase the boss at desired times.
