> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
⬥ Araxxor is an Araxyte spider who lives in the Araxyte lair, a cave beneath the Haunted Woods, just south of Port Phasmatys. 
⬥ He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. 
    • When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base enrage values is used. 
        - This includes minion spawns and its strength in general.

.
⬥ The fight is heavily influenced by the player's choice. 
    • The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path opens. 
        - The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day.

.
⬥ Despite displaying a "None" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. 
    • Players carrying an Araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. 
        - For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an Araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. 
        - Simply creating an instance has the same effect as bringing a pheromone as well.

*Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks.*

.
> __**Drops**__
.tag:drops
His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements.

⬥ <:pheromone:643122483641188372>  **Pheromone**: 1/(50-[Enrage/20])
⬥ <:spiderlegtop:643122501521768491>  **Leg piece**: 1/40 (1/70 in duo)
⬥ <:araxxifang:643148203604049940>  **Hilt**: 1/120  (1/200 in duo)
⬥ <:araxyteegg:643149217313062913>  **Araxyte egg**: 1/500 (200 threshold)

.
*Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mage at Araxxor because it spawns the melee form of Araxxor which applies a typeless bleed to the player.*

.
> __**Presets**__
.tag:preset
__**Beginner Preset**__
⬥ As a beginner, ranged will allow to you keep your distance from Araxxor making it easier to dodge Cleaves and melee hits. 
⬥ If you struggle with food management you may use a Yak, eventually upgrading to using a Nihil/Ripper Demon/Kal'gerion Demon. 
⬥ The bolts equipped are Ruby Bakriminel Bolts (e), but can be replaced with Dragonstone or Onyx variants of Bakriminel bolts.
    • Incorporating bolt switches can improve your damage output
        - For example, Hydrix Bakriminel Bolts (e) can help you get extra adrenaline if needed
        - Ruby bolts become less effective the lower the enemies health is, so it is better to swap to a different bolt whenever Araxxor falls below 50k HP.

As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use <:reckless:643505179378974748> , or your highest tier <:sharp:643505377291534366> if reckless is not available

> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
__**General**__
⬥ Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks
    • Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the 5th auto attack
        - While either of these abilities are up, the player will not pulled in by the cleave and the cocoon special attack will not last as long.
⬥ Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if Araxxor Cleaves, the next special will not be a Cleave.

.
__**Cleave**__
⬥ Araxxor pulls you in and hits the player with a large typeless hit unless the player can get out of the attack range.
    • With Melee and Magic, the player will always need to run away a few tiles to avoid this.
    • With Ranged, the player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to avoid being dragged in.

.
__**Cocoon**__
⬥ Araxxor Wraps the player in a cocoon, causing them to take damage every tick until they escape.
    • To escape, simply spam click.
    • The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> active before this special attack comes.

.
__**Web Shield**__
⬥ Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. 
⬥ This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. 
    • To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. 
    • This special attack can be used to gain some health back by using Resonance on your own hit, 
        - For melee, it is recommended to use Quake since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. 
        - For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. 
        - Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back.

.
__**Minion Spawn**__
⬥ Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each.
    • Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. 
    • Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly.
⬥ When path 1 is open, this special attack can occur on Phase 3/4
    • if Path 1 was taken, minions can also be spawned on Phase 2 
⬥ Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a Mirrorback or Pulsing. 
    • In the first wave, it's the **third** to spawn. 
    • In the second wave, it's the **second** to spawn.
    • In the third wave, it's the **first** to spawn.
    • There is no special spider in the fourth wave.

.
__**Egg Bomb**__
⬥ Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs and fire a slow moving projectile at you. 
    • To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. 
        - If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will take 300 damage. 
        - If 2 eggs are exploded, the player will take 1200 damage.
        - If 1 egg is exploded, the player will take 2100 damage
        - If 0 eggs are exploded, the player will take 3000 damage. 
        - If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb.

.
__**Instakill Spider**__
⬥ Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. 
⬥ The Acid Spider will start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. 
    • when it fills up fully, the spider will explode and you will be safe. 
    • If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. 
    • its speed is variable. 
    • To deal with this, you can either:
        - Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> or Immortality <:immort:535541258538582017> to negate the damage from the spider.
        - Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline.
        - Run away or dodge it if you have room to do so.

.
__**Acid Spiders**__
⬥ On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn Acid Spiders. These can be lured into Araxxor to reduce the enrage of the boss.
    • To do this, click on them and lure them beneath Araxxor.
    • It is better to just ignore these spiders.
    • They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. 
    • The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. 
        - You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. 
        - If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path.

.
__**Light Spots**__
⬥ The Room will go dark and there will be a lit up spot.
    • This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. 
    • Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. 
        - On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.

.
> __**Overview of the Fight**__
.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1**__
⬥ Choose which path you want to open up by clicking on the web blocking it at the start of the fight. The web will burn for 1 minute.
⬥ Araxxor can do 3 different special attacks this phase.
    • Cleave
    • Cocoon
    • Web Shield
⬥ Araxxor cannot be killed. He will revive to 5,000 HP whenever he goes down to 0HP.
    • If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2.
        - If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2.
        - If doing middle path, you can try walking Araxxor towards the web to get a faster phase 2 clear.
        - If doing bottom path, there is no setup that can make it faster.

.
__**Phase 2**__
⬥ **Top Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 5 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Egg Bomb (always the first mechanic on Phase 2)
        - Minion Spawn
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield
    • The goal of this phase is to simply do damage while being mindful of special attacks.
        - Utilizing Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> can help with burst damage.
    • You can go directly from phase 2 to phase 3 whenever you want by running down the hallway.
        - It is recommended to go from phase 2 to phase 3 sometime after the Egg Bomb special attack, but before the next special attack so minion spawns don't get lost when you start going towards phase 3.

.
⬥ **Middle Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 4 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Egg Bomb
        - Instakill Spider
        - Cleave
        - Web Shield
    • The goal of this phase is to lure Araxxor into the large acid pool, let him absorb enough acid, and then drag him up the platform until he starts burning it.
        - Araxxor needs to have absorbed at least 55% acid to ensure he fully burns the platform and opens up phase 3.
        - Araxxor checks to see if he is standing in the acid every 10 ticks (6 seconds) before starting to absorb it. There is a setup guide for this down in the advanced section for Middle Path which can save 6 seconds in a kill.
        - When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3.

.
⬥ **Bottom Path**
    • Phase 2 starts when you run through the barrier the burning web was blocking.
    • Araxxor can do 2 different special attacks on phase 2 of this path.
        - Light Spots (constantly active on this phase)
        - Egg Bomb
    • The goal of this phase is to chase the light spots around the hallway to avoid damage while waiting for Araxxor to charge at you, causing a cutscene and prompting you to dodge it.
        - If you dodge the charge, the wall breaks and phase 3 opens up.
        - If you fail to dodge the charge, you will take damage and need to wait for another charge.
        - The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements.
    • It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility.
        - Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it.
    • Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. 
    • You can conserve food by using Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> on Araxxor's ranged/magic attack whenever possible.
    
*Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage relic can also help with this.*

.
__**Phase 3**__
⬥ **All Paths**
    • Phase 3 starts when you enter the back end of the arena.
    • Araxxor will heal up to 80% of the leftover health he had from phase 1 and 2.
    • Araxxor's attack speed increases on this phase.
    • Araxxor does different mechanics depending on which paths are open.
        - Araxxor can do any special attack from both of the currently open paths.
    • The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxor.
 
.
__**Phase 4**__
⬥ **All Paths**
    • Phase 4 starts after you kill Araxxor in phase 3.
        - There will be a cutscene and Araxxi will be the enemy of the last phase.
    • The goal of this phase is to kill Araxxi.
    • Araxxi Can do 3 different mechanics while she is above 50k hp (no special attacks happen below 50k hp).
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield
    • Araxxi can fight with all 3 combat styles.
        - If player is in melee distance, Araxxi will use Melee or Magic attacks at random.
        - If player is not in melee distance, Araxxi will use Ranged or Magic attacks, whichever the player is currently NOT praying against at the time of attacking.
    • From 50k to 25k hp, Araxxi hits harder and faster, and takes reduced damage from the player
    • At 25k hp, Araxxi drains your adrenaline by 50% and summons an acid core that bounces around the arena.
        - Araxxi takes full damage again once reaching 25k hp.
        - The acid core will deal high damage if it touches the player. If it does this, move one tile to make it start bouncing around again.
*Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you.

*Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: <https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc>*

> **__Phase 4 Tips and Tricks__**
.tag:tips
__**Gaining Adrenaline and Lossless Eating/Devotion**__
⬥ At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline.
    • You can then wait 10 seconds to drop combat stance.
        - This allows you to use Devotion without losing 15% adrenaline.
        - This also allows you to eat solid foods without losing 10% adrenaline per bite.

.
> __**Advanced Guide**__
.tag:advguides
**__Top Path__**
⬥ **Phase 1**
    • This phase is timegated so it can be used to set yourself up for p2 while you deal damage
    • Use <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> when the web burn reaches ~70%
    • Build adrenaline to 100% and use <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>
    • Build back to 100%
    • Wait for araxxor to do a special attack after web finishes burning before going into phase 2

.
⬥ **Phase 2**
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:mds:535541259033378827>
    • <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> towards Phase 3 while doing defensive abilities to gain adrenaline when Araxxor does the Egg Bomb special attack in Phase 2 (the first spec that happens in phase 2).

.
⬥ **Phase 3**
    • You want to turn around in phase 3 as soon as you enter so it is good to learn where Phase 2 ends and where Phase 3 begins. Crossing the yellow line in this picture will start Phase 3. Since you run 2 tiles at a time you can click back towards phase 2 just before you cross the line and your character should still cross it.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/QR0YouB.png
    • Run to the end of the hallway to start phase 3, then run back towards Araxxor. equip <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> again.
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> (depending on if SGB spec is off cd yet or not)
    • By this point in the p3 rotation Araxxor will start spawning minions. look out for the special spider and kill it, then finish Araxxor off with bleeds and another <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:rapid:535541270521708566> as needed. Try to end phase 3 on high adrenaline.

.
**__Middle Path__**
⬥ **Phase 1**
    • Walk araxxor so he is right against the web (see below about how to walk p1)
    • At 99% web burn you can bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into phase 2
        - You'll know if you did it correctly if rax  starts absorbing the acid at 1:06 rather than the standard 1:12. This can be delayed if rax does a spec right before the web finishes burning.
    • Below is a diagram to help with positioning Araxxor on P1 (Camera facing east)
.img:https://i.imgur.com/KtRYknU.jpg
        - The yellow line is the line to stand on after walking Araxxor, if you move 1 more square east Araxxor will run into the web and start going west again which could ruin the setup. If you have trouble finding this spot just keep in mind you must stand 1 east of the line where the skulls are (circled in red).
    • Here is a video example on walking Araxxor in P1: https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k
.
⬥ **Phase 2**
    • Run across the acid pool and 3 tiles onto the ramp. This puts rax as far up the path as he can be while still absorbing acid.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/U49xswa.jpg
.
    • Deal damage
    • When rax has absorbed 53% acid, you can <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> up the ramp, then walk 1 tile west so you have room to dodge cleave specials at the top of the ramp.
        - You'll know you did this correctly if rax goes up to 55% then starts dropping, and you'll get the popup message that the bridge is burning when there is 49% acid left. This is the perfect amount needed.
    • Set up for phase 3
        - Natural instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> timing is calculated based on how much acid rax has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would natural instinct when the bar says 24-19%.
    • Build to 100% and prepare for p3.

.
⬥ **Phase 3**
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → Auto + <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> →  <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:frag:535541273755385885> + walk under → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088> 

.
**__Bottom Path__**
⬥ **Phase 1**
    • No special setup. Just dps araxxor down to <5k hp

⬥ **Phase 2**
    • No special setup. Follow the light and wait for the charge. Stay at 100% adrenaline.
    • When you dodge the charge and Araxxor damages the wall, you can click the minimap to start running into phase 3, and then right click Araxxor when he is going up into the ceiling so you can right click 'attack' instantly in phase 3. This is nice in case minions spawn during p2 to avoid target cycle targeting them instead of Araxxor.

⬥ **Phase 3**
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
    • <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> while running into Phase 3 area → (Target Cycle to Araxxor) <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> + <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:frag:535541273755385885> + walk under → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:mds:535541259033378827>

.
**__Phase 4__**
    • This is the same regardless of which path you took.
    • Spam a defensive or non-mobile surge to gain adren when cutscene ends and drop a dummy, build to 100% adrenaline.
    • <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, build with <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>
    • Equip <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
Just before Araxxi becomes attackable, <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → auto + <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:rapid:535541270521708566> →  cancel with <:snap:535534127131394088> when Araxxi has 26k hp left to avoid adrenaline drain when acid core comes out. Finish with basics if needed

.
**Note:** if you get a really good Phase 3 Seren Godbow special attack and it is still on cooldown when Phase 4 becomes attackable then you may switch your rotation:
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → good basics until Araxxi dies.

.tag:skip
The idea of this method is to solo skip phase 3. If that fails then you still have <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> to help carry the damage to finish phase 3 the normal way. This method doesn't get average times as fast as the non-skip method mentioned above, but it has a way faster killtime potential due to being able to solo skip.

.
**__Extra requirements__**
⬥ <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> **A second EoF** (Dark Bow spec)
⬥ <:accel:756236265472524418> **Powerburst of acceleration**
⬥ <:dummy:656844963522281473> **A second dummy**
⬥ <:heightenedsenses:697808773573771344> **Heightened senses relic is mandatory**

**__Phase 1__**
    • <:incend:535541258429661215> at ~62% web burn
    • <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> at ~85% web burn
    • Build to 110% adren
    • Turn towards web, and when it burns, drink the powerburst of acceleration and <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> straight to phase 3, then immediately drop a <:dummy:656844963522281473> and <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>, then build adrenaline with basics and defensives using <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>

.
**__Phase 3__**
    • Build to 100% adren, and switch to Ruby Bakriminel Bolts (e), then use <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>. If you have extra time before Araxxor catches up to you, you can also do <:anti:535541306475151390> for a bit more adrenaline.
    • Target Araxxor and use an Auto + <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → equip Dark Bow EoF then use<:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:mds:535541259033378827>
    • If Araxxor doesn't die from that, he will start healing hp so do your best to improvise with basics while building up to <:rapid:535541270521708566> or <:snap:535534127131394088> to finish him off.
