> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
Araxxor is 💯💦 an Araxyte spider who 😫😒 lives 🤕 in 👉 the 👏 Araxyte lair, a cave 🕳🕳 beneath 👎 the Haunted Woods, just south 👇 of Port Phasmatys.

.
**__Into the Spider's Den__**
⬥ Araxxor can 🔫 be 🌼🎮 fought 💢 solo 👆 or 🏼💁 duo, although 😛😛 he 🅱 is considerably stronger if 🎅 you 🤔🤷 duo. 
    • When there 🏽😩 are 👌😂 two people fighting instead 💴 of ❤ one, Araxxor's attacks are 💰😤 doubled, and 👏 the higher 🔝✅ of the two ✌💏 base enrage values is used. 🏭 
        - This 👆🤔 includes minion spawns 🤑🤑 and its 👌😆 strength in 🏡🏻 general.

.
⬥ The fight 🔫 is 🤔 heavily influenced by the player's choice. 👐 
    • The player 🤺💰 must choose 📥📥 from one of 💦😎 the 👨 available ✔ paths at the ✊🙀 beginning ➡ of 💦💦 the 💦 fight ✊🙏 by 👏👋 burning 🔥🔥 one of 🌈 the 👏 giant 😱😱 webs near 😯 entrance of 💅 the 👏💌 hive and 💦👏 waiting ⌚ one 😤🔥 minute ⏰⏰ until 🙄💯 the 🤔 chosen path opens. 
        - The player's ♀ choice 🔢 of path 🛣 will affect Araxxor's combat 🕰 mechanics 💰💰 throughout the 🅱 rest of ✝ the fight. 👿😡 Only 🕦 two 💏 of 💯🤑 the 🔚👏 three paths are ❓ available on any 💦 given day. ❕

.
⬥ Despite displaying a 🏠 "None" 😡 weakness 😖 in 🏽🔙 the 😍 combat interface, Araxxor's 3 😭😭 different forms 🐛 actually 😬 have ✊👏 weaknesses in line with the 👀👨 combat triangle. 
    • Players carrying an Araxyte pheromone in ⬅👠 their 💯 inventory will 👏 cause 🔄 Araxxor to 💦🔍 spawn using 🤳 a 🍆👏 combat ♂ style 😂 favourable to the player. 🤷 
        - For example, 🔥🔥 using 🏻📤 ranged to 💦💦 fight 👊 Araxxor while holding 🤑 an 👹 Araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause 💪 Araxxor to spawn using 🤳🏻 Magic. 
        - Simply ⤵⤵ creating 👏👏 an 〰😅 instance 💯💯 has 🅰🏼 the same 😂 effect 🐆📣 as 👏💑 bringing a pheromone as 💰👦 well. 👊

.
*Note: It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from Player Owned Farms; it may be obtained by keeping any elder spider along with a farm totem in both medium paddocks.*

.
> __**Drops**__
.tag:drops
His 👉💦 drops 💦 include 😠 components for 🎅❓ three 💁 level 🔻🆙 90 two-handed weapons, one 👆👀 for 🎁🎁 each combat style, 😂 along 🔝 with 👏🅱 a pet, 🐩 with 💰 multiple skins to 💦 be 👌 unlocked 🔓 for the 💩✊ pet 😫 through 😩🤢 achievements.

⬥ <:pheromone:643122483641188372>  **Pheromone**: 1/(50-[Enrage/20])
⬥ <:spiderlegtop:643122501521768491>  **Leg piece**: 1/40 (1/70 in duo)
⬥ <:araxxifang:643148203604049940>  **Hilt**: 1/120  (1/200 in duo)
⬥ <:araxyteegg:643149217313062913>  **Araxyte egg**: 1/500 (200 threshold)

.
*Note: It is recommended to avoid using Mage at Araxxor because it spawns the melee form of Araxxor which applies a typeless bleed to the player.*

__**Beginner Preset**__
⬥ As 🎨🤔 a beginner, 👶👶 ranged will allow to 🙅 you keep ✊ your 💊👅 distance from Araxxor making 🏽 it easier 😁😀 to 🏻 dodge Cleaves and 🍆🏿 melee hits. 🎯 
⬥ If 👏 you 💦 struggle 😥😫 with 👉 food management you may 🗓 use 👏👏 a Yak, eventually 🎓 upgrading to 💦💦 using 🏻 a 👨 Nihil/Ripper Demon/Kal'gerion 👹 Demon. 
⬥ The 📷👏 bolts equipped are 💯 Ruby Bakriminel Bolts (e), ☄ but can be replaced with Dragonstone or 💁🎡 Onyx variants of 😂 Bakriminel bolts.
    • Incorporating bolt switches can 👀💦 improve your damage output
        - For 📀 example, 🔥 Hydrix Bakriminel Bolts (e) 😨 can 🔫 help 💁 you 🙅 get 🉐 extra adrenaline if 🎅👏 needed 😫😫
        - Ruby bolts become 🏽 less 👎 effective the lower ❌ the 👌👦 enemies health is, 🅱👐 so 💁❗ it 😏 is better 👨🐍 to 😀 swap to a 👏 different 🏼🙅 bolt whenever Araxxor falls below 50k HP.

As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use <:reckless:643505179378974748> , or your highest tier <:sharp:643505377291534366> if reckless is not available

> __**Mechanics**__
.tag:mechanics
__**General**__
⬥ Araxxor will 👌 use 👏 a special 💯 attack ⚔ every 👖💯 5 🍆 auto 🤖🤖 attacks
    • Generally, this should be prepared for by using Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> before the 5th auto attack
        - While 🙌 either 😤 of these 👈👳 abilities are 🔢 up, 🍅 the 👏 player 🤷 will not 😡❌ pulled in 👌 by 👨😈 the 💙 cleave and 🌬 the 🌎 cocoon special 👩😂 attack will 👌 not ❌ last ⬅🕞 as 🍑 long. 🔨😩
⬥ Araxxor will never ❌ use the same 💪 special ✈💅 twice ✌👅 in a 📸 row. 💦💦 For 👀🍆 example, if 👀♂ Araxxor Cleaves, the next special will 👊🤔 not 🚫 be 🅱 a Cleave.

.
__**Cleave**__
⬥ Araxxor pulls 🚙 you 👊 in 👉 and hits 🎯🎯 the 🏻🆕 player with 🎃 a 🐀😧 large typeless hit unless 🙋👏 the 👏🏼 player 🤷 can 🍞 get 🏼 out of 🔴 the 🅱💻 attack 🤼⚔ range.
    • With Melee and 👏👅 Magic, 📿✨ the 👏👌 player 👨♀ will 🤤 always 👏 need 😋😂 to 👏 run 🏃 away 🛣♂ a 👌👉 few tiles to 💦💦 avoid 🙅🙅 this.
    • With Ranged, the player can simply stand at a distance and use Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to avoid being dragged in.

.
__**Cocoon**__
⬥ Araxxor Wraps the player in 👈👉 a 😆 cocoon, causing them 😘👧 to 😘✌ take 😥😈 damage ☄☄ every tick until 🅱🙄 they 👉 escape. 🛫🛫
    • To 😊 escape, simply spam 🔁🔁 click.
    • The duration of being wrapped up is greatly reduced if the player has Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> or Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> active before this special attack comes.

.
__**Web Shield**__ 💦
⬥ Araxxor covers himself 😎 with 😲 a web and heals himself. 
⬥ This special ☄😂 reflects a random 🔀 % of 🚋 the damage you 🤞👩 deal back ⬅😌 to 🐚📴 you. 🙌 
    • To deal with 👉👯 this 😁👉 mechanic, simply 😡 do not attack. 
    • This special attack ⚔ can 💦🏿 be used to ✌💸 gain some health ⛑⛑ back ⬅ by using 🤳 Resonance on 😩 your 👉🍆 own ☯🌈 hit, 
        - For 🎅👨 melee, it 💦💯 is recommended to 💰 use 👏 Quake 😏 since 👨 it 🙅😡 hits 💥💥 slow enough 💦 for 🤔 you 👉 to 💰😔 equip a 💰💰 shield 💦 and catch ⚾⚾ the 🤴 resonance. 
        - For 🌍🎁 range 💦 it is 🤔👏 recommended to use 👏 snipe for 💊 the ❗ same ❗ reason. 😤😰 
        - Be 🔹👶 wary of ♨🚋 crackling and 💦 aftershock proccing during 🚣 this because 💁👑 it can reflect a 🚟 lot of 🔴 unexpected damage back. 😔🗣

.
__**Minion Spawn**__
⬥ Araxxor has 👏🚸 20 📊 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them 😭😤 in 👉 4 waves 🌊🌊 of 5 spiders each. 👏
    • Deal with 😣🅱 this 👈🆕 mechanic by 🏻🏼 getting off 😂📴 right 👌👌 before 😩 the special spider spawns, 🤑 and 👏👏 killing 🔪🔪 it 👎🤔 asap. 
    • Killing the remaining 🕵 spiders is optional but 🍑❄ can help 💁🛠 you take 👏 less ➖😔 damage ☠ if ♂ the 💥🅱 phase 😶🌔 goes 💦🅱 slowly.
⬥ When 🅱 path 🛣🛣 1 👸 is open, 📭 this 🌎 special 💅💅 attack 🤼 can 💯 occur 👻 on 🔥💩 Phase 3/4
    • if 👉👏 Path 🛣 1 🔃 was 🤧 taken, 🚀🚀 minions 💛 can 🔫 also 😒🅱 be spawned on Phase 🌑👏 2 💯 
⬥ Outside of 👱 Phase 🌑 4, there is 🌸 a 👌🔫 predictable order ❌📑 to 😣 these 🤢☠ spawns. 🤑🤑 Each of the 🖖 first 😊☝ 3 💵😘 waves 🌊 will 🤔 contain a ⏳ special spider, either 😤 a Mirrorback or 💁🙅 Pulsing. 
    • In 😅🏡 the 😩🦁 first 🥇 wave, it's 🏿💁 the 👏👏 **third** 🤔 to spawn. 
    • In the 🚟 second ☝🅱 wave, 🌊👋 it's 😼💯 the 🌌➕ **second** 🅱 to 🔎 spawn.
    • In 👆 the 😄🏿 third 🤔🤔 wave, it's the 📉 **first** 🏻 to 👉📧 spawn.
    • There ✔ is 👌 no special ☄☄ spider in 👇 the fourth wave.

.
__**Egg Bomb**__
⬥ Araxxor will spawn a group 🅱 of 💦 2 👑 or 3 eggs 🍳 and 👏👏 fire a slow 😳 moving projectile at 🎓😍 you. 🏃 
    • To mitigate damage, ☠☠ simply 😡 stand on ⛓💰 the eggs. 🍳🍳 The 👀⤴ projectile will explode, 💥 and 👁😫 kill 💀🙃 all 😝👦 eggs within a 🥖 4x4 radius. 
        - If 3 🔀 eggs 🍳 are exploded, the player 😤💰 will 🤔⚽ take ✋✋ 300 💦💦 damage. ☄ 
        - If 🚀🅱 2 🏿 eggs 🍳 are 👴 exploded, the 😊👏 player 📅💰 will take 🛍🛍 1200 damage.
        - If 👩💲 1 ⚖♂ egg is 🔺🤔 exploded, the player 🤷 will 😛👏 take 👏🖐 2100 damage
        - If 🤔 0 😊😊 eggs are 🔢♂ exploded, the player 💰😤 will ⚽💰 take 3000 damage. ☠ 
        - If 🤥 eggs 🍳 are 🏼 not exploded, then 👏👱 they 👥🙅 will 👏 hatch 🐣🐣 into 👉👉 spiders as well. 🤓⛲ The 👏👏 first 😢👌 special ✈👾 attack ⚔ on 🔛 phase 🌒 2 🍞 for 🍆 top 🔼🔼 path 🛣 will ⚽ always be 🏿😡 egg 🥚🈴 bomb. 💣

.
__**Instakill Spider**__
⬥ Araxxor will 🤔 perform ☝☝ a 🚟😤 melee attack ⚔⚔ animation 🛌🍆 and 👏🙌 send 📦📩 out a 🏿 projectile which 😡 will ✊ leave 🏃 a 🅱🍬 green mark where it 🔌 lands; the 😃⚰ spider will spawn here. 
⬥ The Acid Spider will 👏 start walking towards you 👉 with 👏👏 a 🏖 gauge bar 😫😫 above its 🌲 head 👉💆 that fills up. 🔺 
    • when it fills up fully, 😕☑ the spider will 👏 explode and 💰👏 you will 🏼😜 be 🐝🐝 safe. 👷👷 
    • If 🔎 it touches 🏼 you 💕 before 🔙😩 the 💰🍝 bar 🥃😫 fills up 👎⬆ it will explode 💥💥 on 🔛 you and 👏👏 deal a severe amount 📉📉 of damage. ☄ 
    • its 👉😆 speed is 💦 variable. 
    • To 💦 deal with this, 👈⬆ you 🏻😩 can 💦 either: 😤😤
        - Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> or Immortality <:immort:535541258538582017> to negate the damage from the spider.
        - Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline.
        - Run 😭🏃 away 😅🙅 or 🚨 dodge it if 🚀🏿 you 😀 have 🅱 room to do 💬♂ so.

.
__**Acid Spiders**__
⬥ On 🔛🔛 phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes 🔜 spawn Acid Spiders. These 😍📀 can 👍💦 be 📖⚰ lured into 👉👉 Araxxor to 💦😤 reduce the 🚗 enrage of 💦 the ⚰ boss.
    • To do this, 😞🔎 click 🖱🖱 on 🔛 them and 🔫 lure them beneath 👎⚰ Araxxor.
    • It is 💦👐 better 😤 to just 💭 ignore these spiders.
    • They are 🔢 distinct from 👉👉 the instakill spiders encountered, as 🍑😖 they 👥⁉ do 🔧👌 not have a gauge bar, and 🙇👏 touching them results 🔢🔢 in 👏👏 nothing ♀ happening. 
    • The 😫💞 amount 🔢🔢 that 😏👨 spawns 🤑 is related to 💦 the 🚨🦏 amount of 👏🍒 acid 👍💯 absorbed 😵 in 👏🏠 the 👇 middle path. 🛣🛣 
        - You ☝ must absorb 😵😵 50% 👏 of 🙌 the 🐬👏 acid in 👇 the 🐕 middle path 🛣 (100% 💯💯 in 👌 duo) in 🏡 order to 👅 proceed 🚶🚶 to phase 🌘 3. 
        - If 👦👀 the ☃🤓 middle 👈 path 🛣🛣 is not 🏼🚫 taken, 4 acid 😛💯 spiders will 👌😡 spawn (25% each); 👏👋 this 😞🍆 scales down for 👊🎅 middle path. 🛣

.
__**Light Spots**__
⬥ The 👈👶 Room will go dark 🕶 and there 🌃✔ will be ☃📖 a 💨👏 lit up spot. ⏺
    • This 📉👈 occurs the 👨🏿 entire 🌪🌪 time ⏱🕥 on 🔛💋 phase 2 🔥🙈 darkness path, and on 💦🔛 phase 🌒 3 😧 and 4 if path 🛣 3 😭💵 is open. 👐 
    • Stand 🏿 in 👏👏 the light spot ⬅📽 to 💰 avoid 🙅 damage. 
        - On lower enrages this 🚮 can 💦 be 🐝 ignored, but starts 🏁 to 💦 hurt at 🍆 higher 🔝🔝 enrages.

.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1**__
⬥ Choose which 👏 path 🛣 you 👈 want 👏💞 to 💦 open up 👆👆 by clicking on 📲 the 👌 web blocking ⛔ it at 🚟 the 🌐🚮 start 🕹👣 of 💦 the 🥗👨 fight. The 😐 web will 👑 burn 🔥 for 👉 1 🥜💡 minute. ⏰
⬥ Araxxor can 💦💦 do 3 🗣😗 different special 👩 attacks this phase. 🌑
    • Cleave
    • Cocoon
    • Web Shield ⚗⚗
⬥ Araxxor cannot 😡 be killed. 🔫😵 He will 🔥 revive to 💀😔 5,000 HP whenever he goes 💦🍆 down to 💦🎼 0HP.
    • If you get Araxxor to <5,000 HP before the web burns, you can choose to do some set ups for phase 2.
        - If doing top path, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> so you won't need to use an adrenaline potion for phase 2.
        - If ☝ doing middle 🖕🖕 path, you can 💦 try 😐😥 walking 🚶🚶 Araxxor towards the 🅱 web to get 😫😂 a faster 🚀🔥 phase 2 😍 clear.
        - If doing 📌 bottom 👇 path, 🛣🛣 there ✔ is no 👎🙅 setup that can make 🖕 it faster. 🔥🔥

.
__**Phase 2**__ 🕝✌

    • You can go 🏻😎 directly ➡ from phase 2 💦🏻 to phase 🌘 3 whenever you 👉💀 want 😘 by 🏼 running 🏃 down the 👏🌊 hallway.
        - It 😍😉 is recommended to 💦 go 🏃♂ from 🔛 phase 🌕 2 😳💋 to 💦🏻 phase 🌗🌕 3 😧🥜 sometime after the ⬇👏 Egg Bomb special 👋 attack, ⚔ but before the 🍂👏 next special attack ⚔ so 😮😯 minion spawns 🤑🤑 don't get lost 😏 when 👏 you 🗣😛 start going ➡ towards ⛪⛪ phase 3. 😭😭

.
⬥ **Middle Path** 🛣🛣
    • Phase 👏🌑 2 starts 🏁↔ when 💦 you 😱🏿 run 🏃🏃 through 🕳 the 📱👏 barrier the burning 🔥🔥 web was 👏🤧 blocking. ⛔

        - Egg 🥚🥚 Bomb 💦💥
        - Instakill Spider
        - Cleave
        - Web Shield
    • The ⏩👨 goal ⚽ of 😫 this 😰 phase is to lure Araxxor into 👉🚪 the ☸ large 🏯🏯 acid 💦 pool, 🌊🌊 let him 🐶😩 absorb 😵 enough 💦 acid, 😝 and ➡🤠 then 🕛🙈 drag 😪 him up ⬆ the 👏 platform until 💦 he 👦👌 starts 🕹🕹 burning 🔥 it.
        - Araxxor needs 🙏 to have 🤜👏 absorbed 😵😵 at 🙈😴 least 55% acid 💯 to ensure he fully burns 🔥 the 😫 platform and 👈🌬 opens up 🅱 phase 3. 🤔😧
        - Araxxor checks to see 👀👀 if 😩 he is 💦 standing 🔪 in the acid 💦💯 every 10 🔟 ticks (6 💪❗ seconds) 🕥 before starting 🤠✅ to 💦😄 absorb 😵😵 it. There ✔ is a 👌 setup guide for 🎅 this 😞👈 down ⬇ in 😈 the 💦 advanced section 📦 for 💰👏 Middle Path 🛣🛣 which can 🔫👀 save 😩 6 seconds 😫 in a 🕦 kill. 👻
        - When the platform has burned about 30%, you can Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> to help gain more adrenaline in phase 3.

.
⬥ **Bottom ⬇👇 Path** 🛣
    • Phase 🌘🌗 2 starts when you run through ➡ the 😈👏 barrier the burning web was ☠ blocking.

        - Egg 🥚🥚 Bomb
    • The goal of 💦😊 this 👉 phase 🌓 is to 👉💦 chase 🏃 the 👏🗣 light spots around the hallway to 💦 avoid damage ☄ while 🤔 waiting for 🍆🌍 Araxxor to 😦💦 charge at 😍🤠 you, 👧😫 causing a 🚟 cutscene and prompting you 🏻 to 💦💦 dodge it. 💯💕
        - If you 👀 dodge the 👅👈 charge, the 💌 wall ⌨ breaks 💥 and phase 🌔🌘 3 opens up. 📐
        - If 👏 you 😂 fail to dodge the 💖🐘 charge, you 💲 will 🍡 take 🤳 damage and 😎😏 need 😂😂 to 👍📃 wait 🅰 for another 👯 charge.
        - The 👏 following inforgraphic shows all four 👏♂ possible 🔝🔝 movements.
.
    • It is highly recommended to bring Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and a piece of gear with a Mobile perk for better mobility.
        - Position 😫 your 💦👈 character to 📧💦 always face 🅱 the 🍗🏆 longer part 🗾 of the hallway. this 👈👉 lets ⛔👉 you 👉 surge straight 👫 and then have 👏 control 😤😕 over 🕛⤴ where 🙅 you 👈 bladed dive ahead 🏻 of 📀 you 👼 from 😲 there, 🤔 making 🛠📗 it 🍆 easier 😀😁 to ➡🙌 reach 🤠 the 💌😘 light 💡🔥 quickly. If the 🏽 light spawns 🤑 behind ↩ you, 😞😧 you 👨 can simply 😡 bladed dive to 😅 it. 😂💨
    • Prayer 💯 can ♀💦 be 👄💰 conserved on 💩👏 bottom path 🛣 by 🚟 turning 🙌 it ☔💦 off 😂 since you won't 💪 be attack anything 👮 besides the 🅿👏 occasional 🕑 minion 👄🍌 and you ♀ can 💦🔫 just 👏👏 prayer 🏼 flick the attacks that 🔪👋 Araxxor does. 😳 
    • You can conserve food by using Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> on Araxxor's ranged/magic attack whenever possible.
    
*Note: You can use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An Adrenaline urn or the Persistent Rage relic can also help with this.*

    • The 👉 goal 🙍 of 🔴🐣 this 🅱😷 phase 🌒 is to ➡ kill ☠🔫 Araxxor.
 
.
__**Phase 4**__ 🙌👀
⬥ **All Paths**
    • Phase 🌕😶 4 💦 starts after you 🤜👏 kill 😛☠ Araxxor in phase 😶🌔 3. 😭😧
        - There will be 😡 a 👦 cutscene and 👏 Araxxi will 👏🤔 be 🐝 the 🌈 enemy of the last phase. 🌔
    • The 👏 goal 🥅🤖 of 💦 this phase 🌓 is 🕤😄 to kill Araxxi.
    • Araxxi Can 🔫 do 😽😂 3 different mechanics while she ♀ is above 👆 50k hp (no special attacks happen below ⬇ 50k hp).
        - Cleave
        - Cocoon
        - Web Shield ⚗💦
    • Araxxi can 💸🔫 fight 😫👊 with 👏 all 💯👀 3 combat ♂🏹 styles.
        - If player 💰 is in ✉ melee distance, Araxxi will 🤔🅱 use 👏 Melee or Magic ✨ attacks at random.
        - If player 👨 is 😈 not in melee distance, Araxxi will 🅱🤔 use 👏👏 Ranged or Magic attacks, whichever the 😂🌫 player 🎮 is currently NOT 🏼🚫 praying 🙏🙏 against 👉 at 🅱👌 the time ⌚ of 🌾🍞 attacking.
    • From 🤤💥 50k to 💦 25k hp, Araxxi hits 🎯🎯 harder 🍆🔩 and 👏 faster, and takes 💜💜 reduced damage from 💥😲 the 🍆🏆 player 🏋😤
    • At 👀🍆 25k hp, Araxxi drains your adrenaline 💉 by 50% and summons an 👌 acid core 💰💰 that 😳💰 bounces around 😲↪ the 😈👽 arena.
        - Araxxi takes 💜💜 full 🈵 damage ☠ again 🔁👑 once 🔥 reaching 👉 25k hp.
        - The 🚀 acid 💯💦 core will deal high damage ☠☠ if 👏👏 it 💩 touches 🏼 the player. If it does this, 👈 move 😎🏼 one tile to make it 🗯💡 start bouncing around again. ❌♀
*Note: You can save a good threshold to use just above 25k hp before you get adrenaline drained and kill Araxxi before the acid core ever has a chance to touch you.

*Note: At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection, as seen in this video: <https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc>*

⬥ **Phase 🌘🌑 2**
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:mds:535541259033378827>
    • <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> towards Phase 3 while doing defensive abilities to gain adrenaline when Araxxor does the Egg Bomb special attack in Phase 2 (the first spec that happens in phase 2).

.
⬥ **Phase 🌘😶 3**
    • You 👊 want to turn 🤔🔁 around in 🏠🛌 phase 🌑🌘 3 😘 as 🏿 soon as 🍑 you 👈💪 enter 💦 so ‼ it 😭❔ is good 😊 to 😄 learn 🎓 where Phase 😶 2 🔥 ends and 👏 where Phase 🌕😶 3 💵 begins. 🔔 Crossing the 💴🆕 yellow 💛🎷 line in 👏 this 👈🚟 picture 📷 will start Phase 3.

    • Run to the end of the hallway to start phase 3, then run back towards Araxxor. equip <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> again.
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> (depending on if SGB spec is off cd yet or not)
    • By this point in the p3 rotation Araxxor will start spawning minions. look out for the special spider and kill it, then finish Araxxor off with bleeds and another <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:rapid:535541270521708566> as needed. Try to end phase 3 on high adrenaline.

**__Middle Path__**
⬥ **Phase 👏🌑 1**
    • Walk 🚶🏼 araxxor so 💯 he 👨🏻 is 💦 right 👌👌 against the 🌎🗣 web (see below 😫 about 💭 how to 🔟✌ walk 🚶 p1)
    • At 99% web burn you can bladed dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into phase 2
        - You'll 😫😒 know 😍👅 if 🤷 you 🏼😀 did 🙀 it correctly 🤗✔ if 🏿 rax  starts 🏁 absorbing the 👏 acid 👍 at 1:06 👸 rather than 🔪👉 the 👏 standard 1:12. 🤜❌ This can 💦🔫 be delayed if 😩👏 rax does a ↘🅰 spec right before the 💉 web finishes burning.
    • Below ⬇⬇ is 🎶😂 a 😘👌 diagram to help 👍😵 with 👏👏 positioning Araxxor on 😖↕ P1 (Camera facing 😫 east) 🌍🌍
.img:https://i.imgur.com/KtRYknU.jpg
        - The ☝👏 yellow line 🙋 is 😅 the 🏻👏 line to stand ⛱⛱ on after walking Araxxor, if you move 👊 1 ☠ more ➕💦 square east 👉 Araxxor will 🔥🤗 run 🏃🏃 into 👉 the 💡 web and start 🅱▶ going west again 💦 which 👏👌 could 🤔 ruin the setup. If 👏 you have 🈶👏 trouble 😱🆘 finding 🕵 this spot 💓 just keep in 👏 mind 👨🅰 you 🏻🍁 must 👍 stand 💨🏿 1 💦 east of 🕯 the ⏪👏 line 🙋 where ♂ the skulls are (circled in 😏 red). 👹👹
    • Here 👌🔥 is ❤ a 📢 video 📹📹 example on walking 🚶🚶 Araxxor in P1:

.
⬥ **Phase 2**
    • Run 🏃🐒 across 👏💰 the ➕ acid pool 🌊 and 🏿 3 tiles onto 🖥 the ramp. This 🙆‼ puts 😍😍 rax as 💰🍑 far 🚷 up ☝🍕 the 🙌 path 🛣 as 💰🍑 he 😨 can 🔫🔫 be 🐝💎 while still 😋 absorbing acid. 😝👍
.img:https://i.imgur.com/U49xswa.jpg
.
    • Deal damage
    • When rax has absorbed 53% acid, you can <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> up the ramp, then walk 1 tile west so you have room to dodge cleave specials at the top of the ramp.
        - You'll 🏿 know 🤔 you 👆 did this correctly ✔🤗 if 🏾💦 rax goes 💯 up 🏽❤ to 55% then 🕐👏 starts 🏁 dropping, and 🍆 you'll 🙄 get the ➡ popup message 📧🅱 that 🍆 the bridge is 😳 burning 🔥🔥 when 🍆⏰ there is ☝🙏 49% acid 💯😛 left. 🍒 This 👈 is 🤔🏻 the 👏🦃 perfect 😍 amount 🔢 needed. 🤒
    • Set up for 🔢 phase 🌕🌑 3
        - Natural instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> timing is calculated based on how much acid rax has poured onto the bridge. The timing is roughly when the bridge has absorbed 25-30% acid. Under normal circumstances, this means the popup would appear at 49%, so you would natural instinct when the bar says 24-19%.
    • Build 🏠🏠 to 🅱 100% and 💰 prepare for 🍆❤ p3.

⬥ **Phase 🌗🌑 3**
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>

.
**__Bottom Path__**
⬥ **Phase 1** 💭☝
    • No special setup. Just dps araxxor down to <5k hp

⬥ **Phase 2** 🍆
    • No special 💦 setup. Follow 👣👣 the light and 🅱 wait 🏽🙄 for 🍆 the charge. Stay at 100% adrenaline.
    • When you 👌 dodge the 💌🤝 charge and Araxxor damages the wall, ⌨ you 👈👦 can click 🖱 the minimap to 👌👏 start 🎮 running into 🤓➡ phase 🌑 3, 😭🏼 and then ➡ right click 🖱 Araxxor when 🍑🕕 he is 🕤🏾 going 🗺♂ up ⬆ into the 🤡🔥 ceiling so 💯👟 you can right click 🖱🖱 'attack' 🤼⚔ instantly 💯🔥 in 📝🏡 phase 😶🌗 3. This 😋⚠ is 😩🈶 nice 💦 in case minions spawn during 🚣🚣 p2 to 🚶💦 avoid 🙅🙅 target cycle targeting them 👱🏿 instead of 💥 Araxxor.

⬥ **Phase 🌗 3** 🔀
    • Start with <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
    • <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> while running into Phase 3 area → (Target Cycle to Araxxor) <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> + <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:frag:535541273755385885> + walk under → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:mds:535541259033378827>

.
**__Phase 4__**
⬥ This 👈❓ is the ☸🌧 same regardless of 💦💀 which 👌 path you 💦 took. 😲
    • Spam 🔁 a 👦😭 defensive or 🅱 non-mobile surge to 😊 gain 💪 adren when cutscene ends and 💰👉 drop 🖐🏻 a dummy, build ♀👷 to 100% 💯💯 adrenaline.
    • <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, build with <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>
    • Equip <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
Just before Araxxi becomes attackable, <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → auto + <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:rapid:535541270521708566> →  cancel with <:snap:535534127131394088> when Araxxi has 26k hp left to avoid adrenaline drain when acid core comes out. Finish with basics if needed

.
**Note:** if you get a really good Phase 3 Seren Godbow special attack and it is still on cooldown when Phase 4 becomes attackable then you may switch your rotation:
<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → good basics until Araxxi dies.

.tag:skip
The idea of this method is to solo skip phase 3. If that fails then you still have <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> to help carry the damage to finish phase 3 the normal way. This method doesn't get average times as fast as the non-skip method mentioned above, but it has a way faster killtime potential due to being able to solo skip.

.
**__Extra requirements__**
⬥ <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> **A second EoF** (Dark Bow spec)
⬥ <:accel:756236265472524418> **Powerburst of acceleration**
⬥ <:dummy:656844963522281473> **A second dummy**
⬥ <:heightenedsenses:697808773573771344> **Heightened senses relic is mandatory**

**__Phase 1__**
⬥ <:incend:535541258429661215> at ~62% web burn
⬥ <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> at ~85% web burn
⬥ Build 👷🔨 to 110% adren
⬥ Turn towards web, and when it burns, drink the powerburst of acceleration and <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:bd:535532854281764884> straight to phase 3, then immediately drop a <:dummy:656844963522281473> and <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>, then build adrenaline with basics and defensives using <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>

.
**__Phase 3__**
⬥ Build to 100% adren, and switch to Ruby Bakriminel Bolts (e), then use <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>. If you have extra time before Araxxor catches up to you, you can also do <:anti:535541306475151390> for a bit more adrenaline.
⬥ Target Araxxor and use an Auto + <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofor:745279787471470713> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → equip Dark Bow EoF then use<:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:mds:535541259033378827>
    • If Araxxor doesn't die from that, he will start healing hp so do your best to improvise with basics while building up to <:rapid:535541270521708566> or <:snap:535534127131394088> to finish him off.
