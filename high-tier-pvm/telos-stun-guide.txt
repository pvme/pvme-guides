> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
Stunning Telos takes some getting used to, but with enough practice and knowledge you can greatly enhance your performance from higher survivability to longer window of time to DPS. This guide will assume you primarily use Magic, but Melee can also tap into many of these fundamentals with some changes. Unfortunately, as Ranged does not have an equivalent to either Destroy or Asphyxiate, it cannot stun-lock Telos to the same degree as either Melee or Magic and therefore will not be included much in this guide.

.
> __**Attack Speeds**__
.tag:attack
⬥ You attack every 3 ticks / 1.8 seconds (GCD), 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds if you follow up with 4TAA
⬥ Telos base attack speed is 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds, 3 ticks / 1.8 seconds while in green beam which you generally don't need to worry about

.
> __**Stuns**__
.tag:stuns
⬥ <:impact:535533809655873556> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> / <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> only stuns when it hits for 1.2 seconds. 100% ability damage with 15 second cooldown.
⬥ <:deep:535533833139912724> / <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> / <:tight:535541275957657600> only stuns when it hits for 3.6 seconds. 200% ability damage with 15 second cooldown.
⬥ <:asphyx:535533833072672778> / <:destroy:535532879330148352> always stuns **regardless** of accuracy for 3.6 seconds. This is your best stun. Up to four hits of 188% ability damage per hit with 20 second cooldown.
⬥ <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> / <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> do not stun but bind, which breaks his Freedom nonetheless. Simple to apply with 4TAA if using Magic, and sticky bombs are also easy enough to throw mid-rotation.
⬥ <:nip:537336877900890135> can randomly stun for 4.2 seconds, but can be detrimental at higher level play. Avoid using if following a very specific rotation, but can be decent for learners.
⬥ Jade bakriminel bolts (e) can randomly stun for 4.8 seconds, but can be detrimental at higher level play and are outclassed by ruby/hydrix bakriminel bolts regardless. Avoid completely.

.
> __**Telos's Freedom**__
.tag:freedom
⬥ 150%-249%: 30 second cooldown between Freedom use.
⬥ 250%-999%: 20.4 second cooldown between Freedom use. On P5, when Telos uses Freedom he has stun immunity for 6 seconds, then can be stunned in that 14 second window.
⬥ 1000%-4000%: 10.2 second cooldown between Freedom use. On P5, when Telos uses Freedom he has stun immunity for 6 seconds, then can be stunned in that 4.2 second window.
⬥ Procs whenever off cooldown and if he was bound/stunned in at least the past 10 seconds.

⬥ Right when Telos uses Freedom, his attack cooldown resets and he tries to use his next attack 2 ticks / 1.2 seconds later, even if he just used an attack.

⬥ If Telos Freedoms right after he uses an attack, Telos would attack in 2 ticks instead of the usual 4 ticks / 2.4 seconds.
    •  **This is bad and should be avoided!**
.

.
⬥ If Telos Freedoms 1 tick before his next attack, he must wait 2 additional ticks before using his next attack.
    •  **This is good as it acts as a stun!**
.
https://youtu.be/ZigW16NofNw
.
⬥ If you proc his Freedom immediately by using a stun ability like Impact or Deep Impact, he will attack on the same tick you can use your next ability.
    • Do NOT try to stun immediately after a stun if your first stun triggered Telos's Freedom! The clip below shows how to properly circumvent his Freedom.

> __**General stun combos**__
.tag:combos
To maximize stun time, you have to play around both Telos's Freedom and combo your stuns in the best way possible.

⬥ Longest possible stun uptime below 1000%:
    • Magic: <:impact:535533809655873556> → 3 hit <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deep:535533833139912724>
    • Melee #1: <:backhand:535532854302605333> → 3 hit <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>
    • Melee #2: <:backhand:535532854302605333> → dual wield <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> <:khopeshoh:513206794752098327> <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → → 2h <:zgs:626465964325601290> auto <:destroy:535532879330148352>
        - The autoattack with 2h <:zgs:626465964325601290> after <:destroy:535532879330148352> is known as “5TAA”, or “5T” for short. More info can be found in <#534912860711550989>, but this 5T wastes just enough time between <:destroy:535532879330148352> and <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration. You can even replace <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> with a bleed <:destroy:535532879330148352>, 5T, then use <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>!

⬥ A slightly more damaging, yet shorter stun by one tick stun combo:
<:impact:535533809655873556> →  <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
.
https://youtu.be/fxkfSegn7yU
.
⬥ If Telos has Freedom up:
<:icebarrage:537340400185245701> + any ability, <:wrack:535533809823645697> most recommended → any ability → 3 hit <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deep:535533833139912724>.
    • At 1000%+, Telos will even Freedom after <:deep:535533833139912724>, allowing you to follow up with <:impact:535533809655873556> for even more stun time.
    • Below 1000%, you can add <:impact:535533809655873556> before <:asphyx:535533833072672778>.

.
⬥ Melee has it differently due to sticky bombs. They're a bit more tricky to use, but they don't rely on stopping your abilities to apply them. To pop Freedom perfectly, you need to throw the sticky bomb right as Telos attacks. Doing this will achieve the same result Ice Barrage can. You may need to delay your actual ability rotation for the best stun time possible, but at least throwing the bomb itself shouldn't be too bad.
.
https://youtu.be/IJP8_d3dG-c
.
⬥ A beginner friendly way without 4TAA or sticky bombs:

Pop Freedom with <:impact:535533809655873556> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> → use any ability as long as it's not a stun → 3 hit <:asphyx:535533833072672778> / <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:deep:535533833139912724> / <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>. While this combo is not as efficient as using 4TAA or sticky bombs, it's relatively easy to do and doesn't require anything extra beyond abilities.

> __**Common mistakes**__
.tag:mistakes
⬥ Stunning as soon as Telos attacks makes Telos attack quicker and wastes the stun. Instead, you always want to make sure you stun right before he does any attack.
.
https://youtu.be/jzrbLGTA1nk
.
⬥ Following up a Telos Freedom immediately with a stun. If you use a stun right after popping Freedom, you will waste either the entirety of (<:impact:535533809655873556> / <:backhand:535532854302605333>) or waste most of (<:asphyx:535533833072672778> / <:destroy:535532879330148352> and <:deep:535533833139912724> / <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>).
.
https://youtu.be/B7eumx0U998
.
⬥ Using stuns immediately after another without waiting properly or just mistiming it. This can range from canceling Asphyxiate too early to following up Deep Impact with Impact too quickly to simply mistiming the follow-up stun. Be sure to follow these timings **perfectly** if you want the maximum stun uptime!
.
> __**Stun applications**__
.tag:applications
⬥ All of the above stun combos can work from P1-P4 to maximize stun time. Sometimes it's more efficient to go maximum DPS as stated in the other channels, but in general these stun rotations do lead to the most damage possible before any special attacks/etc.

⬥ At the start of P2, P3, and P4 with Magic, there exists a special stun combo you can do. As Telos takes longer to start attacking you and you can pop Telos's Freedom losslessly with <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> + any slow ability like <:wm:535533809978966037> or <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, all with dual wield. Then you do <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> 3 hit <:asphyx:535533833072672778> to <:deep:535533833139912724> to <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:impact:535533809655873556>. This normally lasts as long as the <:impact:535533809655873556> →  <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:asphyx:535533833072672778> combo, but as both you and Telos take one tick longer to start attacking, the overall stun uptime is still as long as possible with a perfect Freedom at the end.

.
⬥ When using <:deto:535533833358016512> inside fonts on P4, you want to release with <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:impact:535533809655873556> → 3 hit <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:deep:535533833139912724>. This guarantees you will do the 37.5k damage needed to quickly phase him into the next font while preventing Telos from doing anything.
.
https://youtu.be/hMmRE9UuFW0
.
⬥ As a backup, you can force out an <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> to pop Freedom, then *one tick later* use your normal stun combos. This isn't as efficient as a carefully laid out stun rotation, but if you need to improvise, this can easily save you before any potentially bad situation.

> __**Stunning P5**__
.tag:p5
Starting at 250% and above, when Telos Freedoms he gets a 6 second stun immunity on P5. This further punishes bad stunning, but you can still work around this and stun Telos as long as possible.

When the phase starts, Telos will always Freedom immediately, which turns out to be a waste for him as you can immediately follow up with stuns after getting inside the green beam and setting up your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. Telos will Freedom again afterwards, but by this point your stuns will be on cooldown so once they come back, you are free to stun again.

At 1000%+, you can no longer stun him as easily. As you only have a 4.2 second window to stun, you only have room for one long stun like <:asphyx:535533833072672778> or <:deep:535533833139912724>. Fortunately with enough raw DPS you can circumvent that fine enough, but should you be lacking in DPS in some way, knowing how to stun properly can still make the difference between a death or a kill. In general, you want to stun Telos after he does three autoattacks after his Freedom. This works no matter if you're in the green beam or not.

Pay attention to when the Freedom happens and when he gets stunned, which is three attacks after Freedom.
