> __**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
Stunning Telos takes 💜 some 💜🕯 getting 💦🍆 used 🙄🆒 to, but 🍑🍑 with enough 💦 practice 🍆 and 👏 knowledge 😍 you 😡 can 😡 greatly enhance your 👀👱 performance from 👉😂 higher 🔝✅ survivability to 🤔😆 longer 🕚🕚 window 💻 of time ⏲ to DPS. This 🚾 guide will 🅱🤤 assume 🤷🤷 you primarily use 👏✊ Magic, but Melee can 💁💦 also ➕☹ tap 💦💦 into many ✋🍺 of 💦 these 👆🤢 fundamentals with some ☝🎑 changes. 💰💰 Unfortunately, 😭 as Ranged does not have 👏🐵 an equivalent to either Destroy 🔫🔫 or 💁💀 Asphyxiate, it 😂😩 cannot 🚫 stun-lock Telos to the ☝🎅 same 💁😯 degree 🍆👅 as 🅰🍑 either Melee or 😤👱 Magic 📿📿 and 🌬 therefore will 🏼 not ❌ be included much in 👌🅱 this ♂ guide.

.
> __**Attack Speeds**__
.tag:attack
**__You vs Telos__**
⬥ You attack ⚔🤼 every 3 😳 ticks / 1.8 seconds 😫🕚 (GCD), 4 🕓😂 ticks / 2.4 🍆 seconds 😫 if 💵 you 👉👉 follow up with 4TAA

.
⬥ Telos base attack ⚔⚔ speed ⏩⏩ is 🙈🅰 4 📅👌 ticks / 2.4 🙈 seconds, 🕚😫 3 ticks / 1.8 👸🤜 seconds 😫🕥 while ♀🏻 in ⬅ green 😁 beam 🔦🔦 which 🙌👏 you 😩😒 generally 😄👀 don't 🙈🚫 need 👏 to 😊 worry ♂ about 🤓💦

> __**Stuns**__
.tag:stuns
**__Basic Stuns__**
Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> / Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> / Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> only stuns when it hits for 1.2 seconds. 100% ability damage with 15 second cooldown.

.
**__Threshold Stuns__**
⬥ Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> / Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> / Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> only stuns when it hits for 3.6 seconds. 200% ability damage with 15 second cooldown.

.
⬥ Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> / Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> always stuns *regardless* of accuracy for 3.6 seconds. This is your best stun. Up to four hits of 188% ability damage per hit with 20 second cooldown.

.
**__Non-stuns that Break Freedom__**
<:icebarrage:537340400185245701> / <:stickybomb:655341074306301964> do not stun but bind, which breaks his Freedom nonetheless. Simple to apply with 4TAA if using Magic, and sticky bombs are also easy enough to throw mid-rotation.

.
**__Other Stuns__**
⬥ Dreadnips <:nip:537336877900890135> can randomly stun for 4.2 seconds, but can be detrimental at higher level play. Avoid using if following a very specific rotation, but can be decent for learners.

.
⬥ Jade bakriminel bolts (e) 💗👶 can 💪🔫 randomly stun for 4.8 seconds, 🕚🕞 but 🌸 can be detrimental at higher 🔝🔝 level 🔻🆙 play 🎊😂 and ✔ are outclassed by 👋 ruby/hydrix bakriminel bolts regardless. Avoid completely. 😫😣

.
> __**Telos's Freedom**__
.tag:freedom
**__Enrage Cooldowns__**
⬥ **150%-249%**: 30 second ⏱🕐 cooldown between Freedom use. 👏❌

.
⬥ **250%-999%**: 20.4 🔳 second ✌🅱 cooldown between 🖕 Freedom use. On 🔛 P5, when Telos uses 🆒 Freedom he 🚹👨 has stun immunity for 👷 6 🏠🤘 seconds, then 💯 can 💁 be 🐝 stunned 😨😨 in 🔫 that 14 second 🅱 window. 💻🏙

.
⬥ **1000%-4000%**: 10.2 🕳 second 🅾☝ cooldown between ↔🏻 Freedom use. 👏👏 On 🔛➡ P5, when 👌🕒 Telos uses 🆒🆒 Freedom he 👏👨 has 👏 stun immunity for 👦🤔 6 ❓💪 seconds, 🕥 then ❓❓ can be 🐝🅰 stunned in 😋👌 that 👼 4.2 second window. 🏙🏙

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ Procs whenever off 👏 cooldown and 😩 if he 🚫🚹 was 👌👏 bound/stunned between Freedoms.
    • Example: 🔥 At ❤ 150% enrage, if you 🏻👈 bound or 💰 stun Telos immediately 🤣 after 👀💦 Freedom, Telos will 🍆👏 always ❗⌛ use 👏 Freedom exactly 30 🚹📅 seconds 😫🕚 after 👀 the previous one, 😤🚟 even 🆗 if 👏 you ⛎👈 didn't 😊 bind or 😤 stun Telos after 👀👀 that.

.
⬥ Right 👍 when ⏱💦 Telos uses Freedom, his 🤔💦 attack cooldown resets and 👏📗 he 👨👨 tries to 👨💱 use 👏🚀 his next ▶ attack 2 ticks / 1.2 ❄ seconds 😫 later, 🌃📅 even if ⬅👏 he just used 🏭 an attack.

.
⬥ If 😱🤤 Telos Freedoms right after ❌ he 👑 uses 🆒🆒 an 🏼 attack, 🤼🤼 Telos would 😵👪 attack 🤼🤼 in 2 ticks instead of 🏧 the 👏 usual 4 ticks / 2.4 💁 seconds.
.

.
*Note: This is bad and should be avoided!*

.
⬥ If 🤥 Telos Freedoms 1 tick before 🍑🎄 his 👈🙋 next 🤗👉 attack, ⚔ he must 💰🔐 wait 🙄😓 2 💦 additional ticks before 🈳😈 using 🏻📤 his next ⏩ attack.
.
https://youtu.be/ZigW16NofNw
.
*Note: This is good as it acts as a stun!*

.
⬥ If 🅱🤔 you proc his Freedom immediately 👏😭 by 🍭😈 using 🤳🤳 a 🕦➡ stun ability like 😁 Impact or 🅱 Deep 😝💰 Impact, he will 😠👏 attack ⚔🤼 on 💦🐫 the 👉 same 🖕 tick you can 💰 use 👏🚀 your next 🗓👉 ability. 👉👉
    • Do 👌👌 NOT try to 💰 stun immediately 🤣🤣 after a 👌👨 stun if your first stun triggered Telos's Freedom! The 💬👇 clip below 😫 shows 👌 how 🤔💯 to 💦🔥 properly ☑ circumvent his 👉 Freedom.

> __**General Stun Combos**__
.tag:combos
To maximize stun time, ⏳⌚ you 👉🏥 have 😂👏 to play around 🕦🔃 both Telos's Freedom and combo 🍟 your 😄😈 stuns in the 💦💦 best way ➡ possible. 🔝

.
**__Stun Combos__**
⬥ Longest possible 🔝🔝 stun uptime below ⬇ 1000%:
    • Magic: 📿📿
<:impact:535533809655873556> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3 hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724>
.
https://youtu.be/JDoVptf9yIU
.
    • Melee #1: 🔀
<:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> (3 hit) → <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>
.
https://youtu.be/pHRv3QO_BTA 🐕
.
    • Melee #2: 🙀
<:backhand:535532854302605333> → (dw) <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → (5taa) + <:destroy:535532879330148352>
.
https://youtu.be/LZuxkRYm71g 🤑
.
*Note: "5TAA", or "5T" for short, is doing an autoattack with 2H after using an ability with DW. More info can be found in <#534912860711550989>, but this 5TAA wastes just enough time between Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> and Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration. You can even replace Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> with a bleed Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, 5TAA, then use Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>!*

.
⬥ A slightly more 🍗📈 damaging, yet shorter 😐 stun by 😈 one tick stun combo: 🍔🍔
<:impact:535533809655873556> →  <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
.
https://youtu.be/fxkfSegn7yU ♥🤔
.
⬥ If ❗ Telos has 👏 Freedom up: ⬆🔺
<:icebarrage:537340400185245701> + any ability, <:wrack:535533809823645697> most recommended → any ability → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3 hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724>.
    • At 1000%+, Telos will even Freedom after Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724>, allowing you to follow up with Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> for even more stun time.
    • Below 1000%, you can add Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> before Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>.

⬥ Melee has 🙏 it 😢 differently due 👅 to sticky bombs. They're 👴 a 🐝🏻 bit 😁 more ➕💯 tricky to use, ❌ but 🍑🍑 they 👧👩 don't 👎 rely on 👏 stopping 🆘🆘 your 💋🅱 abilities to 💦 apply them. ✈ To pop ✨🎙 Freedom perfectly, you need 👍👌 to throw the ❄👏 sticky ☘💦 bomb 💣💣 right as Telos attacks. Doing 🏿📌 this will achieve 😌 the same 💩 result Ice 🎸 Barrage can. 💯 You 😩 may need to 😢➡ delay your actual ability rotation for 👉 the 👏 best 💆👯 stun time possible, but at 🍴 least 🔥🚫 throwing the ➡👏 bomb itself 👈 shouldn't be 🐝 too bad. 😞🚫
.
https://youtu.be/IJP8_d3dG-c 😎🤑
.
⬥ A 👏 beginner 👶 friendly way without 4TAA or sticky ☘😝 bombs:

Pop Freedom with <:impact:535533809655873556> / <:backhand:535532854302605333> → use any ability as long as it's not a stun → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3 hit) / <:destroy:535532879330148352> (3 hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724> / <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>.
.

.
*Note: While this combo is not as efficient as using 4TAA or sticky bombs, it's relatively easy to do and doesn't require anything extra beyond abilities.*

**__Actions to Avoid__**
⬥ Stunning as soon ⌛ as 👄😠 Telos attacks makes 💘 Telos attack quicker 💨💨 and 💆 wastes the stun. Instead, 🔖 you always 😍❗ want to 🚶🏼 make sure 🌚 you stun right 🅱 before ⏪💰 he 😎🍆 does 😈✊ any 🎉🈸 attack.
.

.
⬥ Following up a Telos Freedom immediately with a stun. If you use a stun right after popping Freedom, you will waste either the entirety of (Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> / Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>) or waste most of Asphyxiate (<:asphyx:535533833072672778> / Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> and Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> / Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>).

⬥ Using 🏻 stuns immediately 😭🤣 after another ➕🚪 without 👹🏻 waiting ⌚🚼 properly ☑👸 or 💁 just mistiming it. 😞🔫 This can range 🤤💦 from 🔛🅱 canceling Asphyxiate too 💀🚬 early 🕐 to ♂ following up 🦃 Deep Impact with 👏 Impact too 💗 quickly ⏰⏰ to 💦 simply 😡 mistiming the 👘👦 follow-up 👣 stun. Be 🐝😡 sure 😤👉 to ➡ follow 👣 these 💦 timings *perfectly* 🍑 if ♂ you 👏 want 👏👏 the maximum stun uptime!

**__Tricks__**
⬥ All 💯 of 💦💦 the ♀ above stun combos can 🤕 work from P1-P4 to maximize stun time. 👏🕒 Sometimes 🕑🕑 it's more efficient 🔛 to 💦😂 go maximum DPS as 🛠🏃 stated ✊🗣 in the 🔯🍑 other channels, but 👏🍆 in 👮🌞 general ♂♂ these 📄🔫 stun rotations do 👎👎 lead 👩 to 💦 the 🤓 most 💯 damage possible 🔝 before ❄ any 🏼 special 💅🏽 attacks/etc.

.
⬥ At the start of P2, P3, and P4 with Magic, there exists a special stun combo you can do. As Telos takes longer to start attacking you and you can pop Telos's Freedom losslessly with <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> + any slow ability like Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> or Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, all with dual wield. Then you do <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3 hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:impact:535533809655873556>. This normally lasts as long as the <:impact:535533809655873556> → <:deep:535533833139912724> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:asphyx:535533833072672778> combo, but as both you and Telos take one tick longer to start attacking, the overall stun uptime is still as long as possible with a perfect Freedom at the end.
.

.
⬥ When using Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> inside fonts on P4, you want to release with <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:impact:535533809655873556> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3 hit) → <:deep:535533833139912724>. This guarantees you will do the 37.5k damage needed to quickly phase him into the next font while preventing Telos from doing anything.
.
https://youtu.be/hMmRE9UuFW0
.
⬥ As a backup, you can force out an <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> to pop Freedom, then *one tick later* use your normal stun combos. This isn't as efficient as a carefully laid out stun rotation, but if you need to improvise, this can easily save you before any potentially bad situation.

> __**Stunning P5**__
.tag:p5
Starting at 🍗😂 250% and 👏🌬 above, when 🍑 Telos Freedoms he gets a 6 👏 second 🅾 stun immunity on 🔛👅 P5. This ⬆🏻 further 🔙🤔 punishes bad stunning, but you 😫 can 💦 still 🍺 work 😭 around this 👀🤔 and stun Telos as 🏿 long 😩🕑 as possible.

.
When the phase starts, Telos will always Freedom immediately, which turns out to be a waste for him as you can immediately follow up with stuns after getting inside the green beam and setting up your Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. Telos will Freedom again afterwards, but by this point your stuns will be on cooldown so once they come back, you are free to stun again.

.
At 1000%+, you can no longer stun him as easily. As you only have a 4.2 second window to stun, you only have room for one long stun like Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> or Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724>. Fortunately with enough raw DPS you can circumvent that fine enough, but should you be lacking in DPS in some way, knowing how to stun properly can still make the difference between a death or a kill. In general, you want to stun Telos after he does three autoattacks after his Freedom. This works no matter if you're in the green beam or not.

Pay attention to 🖇 when 😂 the 👽🏥 Freedom happens and 👏 when he 👨 gets 👀😵 stunned, 😨 which 👌👌 is 😤🔥 three attacks after 😩👀 Freedom.
