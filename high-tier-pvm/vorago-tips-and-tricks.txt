Some of this information is already 🤢 listed on the 💦👏 RS Wiki but 🍑 for 🤙🔯 the sake of 💦 completion I will 🅱 reiterate them 👙👸 here.
This is 🙈 not ⛔ an ✒🌑 extensive list of 👄💦 all 💦👌 glitches and 💰 misc. tips as I’m sure there 🏿😩 are more to 🍆😤 be 😩 discovered. 😎🚢
Unless stated ✊✊ otherwise, all 🌎💯 of 💦 these 🤤👈 apply to 😳 both normal mode and ➕🌬 hard mode.

⬥ **__Pre-Fight__**
.tag:miscpre
    • **Challenge Timer**
        - Vorago’s fight challenge 🏋 operates on a timer of 20 🎉 seconds. 🕥😫 If you ☝ teleport away ♀😬 after 🕑 you’ve 👈🙉 accepted Vorago’s challenge 💪💪 to 💦 fight, ✊👊 and 🍞 you 👉🤗 travel 🛫 back ⬅ to the 🔝 Face area within 👏👌 the 💳 20 🎉 seconds, 🕥 Vorago will still start the 👨 encounter and 🍞 bring 📉⬅ everyone 👯🤜 into P1.
        - Potential application: If 👏 you 👦 teleport away, 💨🏃 do not return 💎↩ to 💰⛔ the 🍗😜 Face 👦 area within 20 🎊 seconds 😫😫 unless 😩 you 👶👉 wish 😢👐 to 💦🗣 join 🚟🚟 the 💞👩 fight. 🏾
    • **Fake 😜😜 Dropdown**
        - There ✔👌 are 💨 some 🍭🍑 methods wherein you 😘 can 👀 take 🅰✋ the 👏 dropdown damage ☄☠ but ❄🍑 not 🙅 enter 💦 the 🌑👑 fight. One method of 💦👏 doing 😘 so 🌃 is ❤ to ⏸ open 😜 the 🌊👏 “change 😩🚟 username” 👏 interface, though 🤔🤥 you do 💦😂 not need 🕵 to 😱 change your username 💁 – just 👌♀ have the interface open. 👐 The 💡 dropdown damage will 🚫 still 😽😽 calculate as 👦🍑 if 🎵 you will 💦⚽ join 🚬🚬 the 💯➕ fight 🔫🤜 (eg. 🅱 In 👆🕶 a ✨ team of 🕯 five, 🖐 the ⏩ dropdown damage will 😜😡 be 🐝 10k even though only 👏 four 🏼👏 people 👯 enter 🍆💦 the kill). 👏❎
        - Potential application: This 👇👈 could be 📖 used to 💦💦 lessen dropdown damage without ♀🙅 having to enter 💦 p1 and 💰 lobby thereafter, in the event 👐 you 😘🏻 need ✅ to 💦🚻 get 💦 someone 👨👤 with low HP into ➡🚟 the 😐🙌 fight. 🙀👊
.
    • **Rest Animation** 🍑
        - If 👏🤔 you 😀 are 💓💯 in 🌋👏 a 💰⚒ rest 😧😊 animation 🍆⛏ when someone initiates the 💜👏 fight 😠 challenge prompt, you 👈 will 🤔👏 not ♀ receive the 🤡 challenge prompt until you 👉😃 have 🅰 left ♂👈 the rest 😊 animation. 
        - Potential application: Don’t 🚫😡 accidentally 😣😣 not accept the challenge 😱 prompt by 😈 resting ⛲ at 🍆🍆 Face. 😩
    • **Lucky 🤞 and Dropdown Damage** ☄☠
        - The 💰 Lucky 🍀🍀 perk can 💰🍞 proc on the dropdown damage. Defenders and Armor set 📚 effects such 😲 as 🍑 the 👴 Saradomin Warpriest effect 🐆 can 🤕 also 😨 proc on the dropdown damage nulling it ☔👱 to 1. 🕴
        - Potential applications: Get 👌 lucky and 👊 take 📴👀 1 damage ☄ instead of 🅱💥 12500. This 🚷🙌 is 👍🚟 unlikely to 👅 be 😐 useful for 👌💥 regular 😶 kills ☠ however. 💰
    • **Powerburst of 💦🙏 vitality**
        - Dropdown is 20 seconds after challenge, so 😴 you ☑ can time ⌚ using 🤳 the 👦 powerburst of 💦 vitality by 👉😈 using a defensive ability like 👍 Preparation. Then 🕛👀 right ✔🎃 when it 💯 has 👏 some 👨☝ time before ⬅ it 😰🤔 comes 💦💦 back, you 👈😂 can 🚫🔫 use the 😎🍩 powerburst right 👌 then 💦 to start the 💦😂 fight with 👩 more 👥 health 💉💉 than if 👏😂 you just ♀ used a phoenix necklace. 💍 You 👦👊 can 😤 also 👨➕ bring 📉📉 only 😎🕦 one 👨 dose if 🤔🤔 you 💖 don't 🙈🚫 need ✊🤗 it 😳🙂 for 🤝💊 the 👏👏 rest of 💦 the kill ⚰ so you can 🔫💸 equip your 2h weapons without needing to 🔭 eat 👉 something else. 😩👴

⬥ **__Phase 1__** 🌸
.tag:miscp1
    • **Less 〽 Bombs 💣 on 🔛🏿 P1**
        - Once 🅱💯 the TL5 reaches the top 🚫🔼 rock and 〰👏 vokes Vorago, Vorago will 🏼👙 throw less 〽➖ auto attacks and 🍆 often 💰💰 have 💰 a 😗 longer delay between 🏻👏 auto 🤖 attacks, provided no 🙅 one else is 🅱 standing in 🕕👏 MD (ie. 🅱 Base 👺 should 😎 not voke and stand 🕺💨 MD until 💯 around 🔃 30k hp).
        - Potential application: In 👏👌 trios, this ⬆👹 lessens the number 📱💦 of 🏫 blues 😧 and 😟👀 red ❤🛑 bombs 💣 the Bomb Tank has to 💰 take during 🏃🚣 P1
    • **TL5 Corner 💀 and 👿🐦 Attack ⚔ Range**
        - Assuming the 🚟 Base 😢 lures Vorago to 👉 the 👑🏽 North 💈☝ West quadrant so 😐👅 that the TL5 takes 💜 bombs 💣💣 as he climbs to the voke spot, 💗😂 the far 🌌 North ☝💈 West corner ⤵ of 💯💦 the 👏🌾 TL5 path is often 💰😵 too far away ➡😜 from 🛣💋 Vorago’s attack 🤼 range. 💦💦 Thus, 😂 if 👏 the 👏🆕 TL5 spends too 👌 long in ❤😫 the corner ⤵💀 of the North 💈 West section, Vorago will 👏👙 start ⏸ throwing bombs 💣💣 to 💦🗣 the 🅰👏 next furthest person 🚶 which 🤤 is usually the 👏 Bomb 💥💥 Tank.
        - Potential application: The 👏 TL5 should 😕💦 run 🏃 past 👏⚰ the North West corner 💀 as 😴🍑 fast 💨⌚ as possible to avoid 🙅🙅 sending bombs 💣💣 to 🏽😈 the 😢 Bomb 💦💦 Tank in 🙌👏 trios. 
.
    • **How to ✌🍑 Lobby P1**
        - If 🙄 the 🤜 TL5 is 🅱😩 standing 🏿 on 💡 the 🏿🏻 top 🔼🚫 platform and 🏼 vokes Vorago, the 👏 rest 🚔 of 💦😏 the 🚀🦁 team 🏃 can 💯 run 👌 to 😪 the 👥 South wall and exit combat 🔫 to lobby. Vorago may 🤷🏻 throw 😷 occasionally 🐶🐶 throw 👐👐 blue 🏼🙆 bombs 💣💣 to the people 👨 running Southward, though, 🤗🤥 he will 💰🤔 do 👌🏆 it 😉 so 😐🔫 infrequently that 😤👊 you 👈 should 💘😕 still be 👏💎 able 💪 to 👌💦 lobby in ⬇👇 between blue ♂ bombs. 💣💣
        - Potential application: Lobby p1 if 👏 someone dies ⚰ and you 😅🅱 don’t 🚫 want 🤵🤕 to 💦 invest more 🍥 to 💦 further 🤔 the 🏆 kill. ☠
    • **Jump Damage Null**
        - Upon 💰👤 the 📈🌎 TL5 clicking to ➡💦 jump 🏻 on 🔛 Vorago, all 🕔 incoming damage ☄ will 😩🅱 be nulled on the 💛👏 tick when 🍑🍆 the 🎅 TL5 clicks to 💦🙊 jump. 
        - Potential application: If Vorago is close to HP reset and ⏱ the 👏💬 TL5 sees 👀 someone 👱🕵 doing 🅰 a 🍞 wild 😍💖 magic 📿✨ that 🤔 will reset the HP, the TL5 can click to 💀😤 jump 🏻👏 and immediately 😭💰 null any 💦 incoming damage, ☄ preventing an 💶👹 HP reset.
    • **TL5 Staying in ⬇ Combat** 🏹🗡
        - The 👨 jump animation 🛌 is 💦😓 exactly 😉😉 17 seconds. 🕞🕚 As 🖕😴 the TL5, it 💪 is possible 🔝 to 👏💦 stay ❕ in combat during 🚣🏃 the 😢💋 jump 🏃 animation. 🍆 This requires the TL5 to 🐚💱 do 💯😴 an 💉 ability 👉👉 on 🤣 the 🏳👨 tick you 🐵😭 click 🖱🖱 to 💦 jump. If 👏🎵 you do 👀🏆 an ability 👉👉 and 👏 wait a 📢💅 couple ticks before jump, 🏻 you 😢👧 will 🤴🍆 have exited 🚪🚪 combat ♂🏹 and 🙏 lost adren during 🚣🏃 the jump 👏 animation. 
        - Potential application: This is 🤔 a 👌 way for the 😃 TL5 to 🙌 keep 🏿👌 adren during 🏃 jump ↙ and 😩 threshold after 👀🍊 jump 🏻👏 to 🔜 end p1 faster. 🔥🔥
.
    • **Movement after 🔜😡 Jump**
        - If the 💰 Base 👺 moves 💃 away from MD during 🏃🏃 the 👏 jump animation, ⛏💦 Vorago will 😘 follow the Base 😵😿 as 😠🍑 if 👏🅱 Vorago is 🙈😳 still 😽 in 🚫 MD. However, 💯🖐 Vorago will 🎧 not visibly 😳 move 🏃 as 💑👦 he 👨🏾 is 🙀 stuck in 👏🍑 the 👉👏 jump animation. After the 🏡 jump 🏻 animation 🍑 is 😗🤔 over and 👏 the 📺 TL5 reaches the ground, 🔝📈 Vorago’s character will 🅱 “teleport” to 💯✌ be 🐝 MD of 💦 where-ever the 👏 Base 👺 has 👏 walked to. 
        - Potential application: In 👉 duos, the Base 😢 can 🔫💰 escape ♐♐ during 🚣 the 👉 jump animation. 🛌 If the 👏 Bomb/TL5 💣💦 happens to 🔬😅 have 👨😣 a ♀💰 red bomb on 🔛🔛 them, the red ❤🔴 bomb won’t 💪💪 deal 3k damage as 😥🍑 the 📖 Base is 😲 far 💶🆘 enough ⏰👅 away. Be sure 😊 to 💦😂 walk 🏼🏼 one 😨☝ step 👣 north after 😏👀 you’ve escaped to 🌒👁 prevent 🚫🚫 Vorago from moonwalking around 🔹↪ the 👏🌊 Base. 👺
    • **Movement after 👀💯 Jump 🏃↙ part 2** 🏿
        - After 👀 Vorago has moved to the 💰🍰 Base’s 👺 MD post-jump, 😡 Vorago will 🖕 not 🙅🙅 move ♂♂ from 🍆🍆 that 👉 location 👌👌 unless 😩 the Base steps under 👎👇 him.
        - Potential application: If 👻👀 no 😤 one ♿ is 😍 standing 🏿🔪 MD, Vorago will continue 💰 to 👁 throw 😷 blue 🙆 bombs 💣💣 to 💦 the Bomb 💣 Tank. The 👏 Base can step 👞👞 away 🏻 from 🏽 Vorago’s MD and devo-cept the Bomb Tank.
    • **1 👸 HP Glitch**
        - Vorago will 🤔🤔 regenerate HP on phase 🌘🌘 1 😎 at 😂 1:09 (also ➕ 2:09, 👑👫 3:09, 🤔 etc.), if Vorago regenerates HP while 🕗 jumping around 🔃 before the 👏 phase 🌕 transition, Vorago can 🚫 have 🅱😣 random 🔀🎲 aggro at the 🌞 start of p2 meaning 🔪 the 💻 first 😌 bleed 💉😳 on 🅱💯 p2 will 😳💦 also 👨➕ be to 💦 a random person. Vorago can 🔫 also start throwing 🚮 blues and 🗣🍆 potentially reds. The 🌎 blue 🔵 and 🏻 red 🅱 bombs 💣 can follow you 👆 through ☄🕳 the 👏 phase 🌕 transition damage ☄ you 👆👉 upon 💰😽 p2 dropdown. 
        - Potential applications: The 🌛😼 Base 👺 should 👫👫 target cycle as 🏿🗻 soon ⌛🔜 as 🍑 possible 🔝 on p2 to 🍆 ensure 💰 that 💸 Base 😢😵 has 💰👉 aggro on 👗 p2. 

.
⬥ **__Phase 2__** ⛱
.tag:miscp2
    • **Invisible First 🥇 Bleed** 💉
        - The 💻😨 first bleed 💉 of 💦😤 P2 does ❓ not have 👏 a 💯 character animation ⛏ as 🅱 Vorago is 😳😩 still in 👏 his dropdown animation. 🍆🛌 
        - Potential application: Clear the 🚀♂ first 😂 bleed 😳 by 🚗😈 using 📤📤 freedom first, then 🏿 tag 🔞 and voke if you 🤓👉 are ❓💰 the 😟☝ Base.
    • **1 Tick Bleed 😳💉 Clear**
        - It is 🍏♻ possible to 👮🎊 clear the 👦 bleed 💉😳 in 🔝👏 1 ♂👀 tick by first 👆 escaping, then 👀 bladed diving back ⬅ onto 🖥🖥 Vorago within the 🆘🌫 same 😯😂 tick. You must 😡👏 target Vorago with 👏😫 the bladed dive, targeting the 💯🅱 ground 📈 for 💦 MD will 📌💰 not ❌❌ work and 👏 will make Vorago walk 🚶🏼 towards you. 🤜🙏 You 🤗👉 must 🔐💰 avoid 🙅 standing 🏿🏿 on ⛓👋 the 🍃👏 corner ⤵ of Vorago’s MD as 🍑 this 🍑👈 will 😬💎 also 😒 make Vorago walk 🏼 toward you ⁉😖 after 💯 you’ve escaped.
        - Potential application: This 🙄⬆ is 🚋🤔 another ➕ way to 💦👉 keep 👩✊ Vorago in 📥🍌 Base spot 😂⬅ while clearing bleeds without freedom.
    • **Instant Bleed 💉😳 Clear** 📝📝
        - After 🅱 a 🅱 bleed 😳💉 is 💦😐 applied, there ✔ is 🏾 a 👀👌 couple ticks delay between 🏻 when 🍑 the bleed 😳 is applied to 👳 when the dismember icon 🔔🔔 appears on the debuff bar. 🥃🍻 It is 😀💦 possible 🔝🔝 to clear a bleed before 😈⬅ the 💯👨 dismember bleed 💉💉 icon 🔔 appears on 🙏 your 😻😩 debuff bar. 🥃
        - Potential application: You can clear bleeds faster 🚀🔥 than 🔪 you 👵 think. 🤔😮
    • **. Voke Splash**
        - It is 💦 possible to have 👏🎁 a 🅱⏰ voke splash on 💦 P2, and 🏻 (likely) all 🥜👀 other 🏼 phases of 😰🤖 the 💋 boss 😎 too. 😴 If 👏👩 a player vokes Vorago and ❤ another ♂👣 player 😤 is standing 🏿🔪 within 😜 the path of Vorago and 🗣 the 😗 voker, Vorago will 💯 aggro onto 🖥 the person 🙌♂ standing 🏿🏿 in-between 👏 instead.
        - Potential applications: Avoid 🙅 voking Vorago while standing behind 😍 another 🏊 player. 👨 See 🚨 clip:

.
    • **Clearing All 🙄🙌 Bleeds Solo** 🎸
        - It is 💦💦 possible 🔝 to 💦😣 clear 📝💎 all 👌 five bleeds solo. The 😈👏 order 📑 is escape/surge, bladed dive, freedom, escape/surge, bladed dive. Note 📝📋 a 🙀 mobile 📱 perk ⏫ is 😮🔥 needed. 😫🤒 
        - Potential application: Clear 📝 all 🥜 five 🕔 bleeds solo 😂😂 in case of dead 😂 teammates. 
    • **2k Typeless Damage** ☄
        - Sometimes, 🕑 after 🔜🅱 Bring ⬅📉 Him 😤👪 Down, 🏽👇 all ❤😀 players 📱 in the 😂⛓ arena will take a 2k typeless hit immediately 💰😭 after 😜💯 the 👏💡 spam click mechanic. It is 👎 unclear what 😨 triggers this 👈 though 🤔🤥 it is believe 🙌 to be an 🤗 “anti-afk” 🔫 where if ❓ players 💰📱 ignore Vorago for too long, Vorago will 😡 perform ☝ the 🤔 2k typeless hit 😵😵 (similar 💯 to ⚖ how 💁👲 you 🤡 must stay ❕🚀 in 🍑🏡 combat in 👉👇 Yaka). This 🌈👈 2k typeless hit 👊 can 🔫 also ➕ be 💰 encountered during P1 if 👻 the TL5 vokes Vorago and everyone else 🤔🤷 lobbies, but 🍑🍑 the 🙆 TL5 stays in 😂 the ⛓👏 kill 🔫 and exits combat. The TL5 will 😠👏 proceed 🚶 to 💦 take 2k typeless hits. 👊 It 😝😅 seems 🔥 the 🚗☠ entire 🌲😂 team 🏃 must 🔒 exit combat for 💰💰 this 👈 bleed 😳 to 👏➡ occur, 👻👻 though 🤥🤥 confirmation on 😎🏻 this is needed. 
        - Potential applications: Keep 👌👌 above 🔝🔝 2k HP after 👀💯 Bring 📉➡ Him Down 🏽⬇ just ♀👤 in case.
    • **Stuck ❌ Under Vorago**
        - During Bring ⬅➡ Him 🖕😀 Down, ⬇👇 it 😤💯 is 🔪 possible 🔝 to get 👾 stuck under 👎 Vorago after 😏❌ the 👏😩 spam 🔁🔁 click 🖱🖱 mechanic. This is 🙅🈁 usually triggered by 👏 standing 🏿 under Vorago during 🏃🚣 the 💦 Bring Him 😤 Down ⬇👇 mechanic. 
        - Potential applications: Avoid 🙅 standing under ❌👇 Vorago during 🚣🏃 Bring 📉📉 Him 😥 Down. 🏽👏 
.
    • **Bring Him 👰👴 Down ⬇ – DPS Check**
        - The 🙀🌈 Bring ➡ Him Down 🏻 DPS check 👀 to 🤑👉 make 😤 Vorago stumble is 50k Hp no ❌♂ matter 🤛 the team 💰 size. This 👈🤐 is 💦 rather ☑🅱 trivial to 😂 do in 📥🅿 a 😰👨 team size 💪🏻 of 💯 3+ 💵😳 but 🏾🤤 becomes harder in Duos. 
        - Potential applications: Do 🏆😧 approx. 50k worth 💰 of 💦 damage ☠ during 🚣 Bring Him Down 👇😫 to 🎦 get 👌👏 past ⚰ the 👩🔵 mechanic.
    • ** Bring Him Down 😫 – Staying in 🔙👏 Combat** 🔫
        - Occasionally, it is ❤💦 possible 🔝 to 💦🙅 exit combat and 💦💩 drop adren during the 😃🏥 Bring ➡ Him ⬆🦊 Down 🖕⬇ spam 🔁 click 🖱🖱 mechanic. This 👈 usually occurs when 🙃🍑 players 💰 have refreshed their ⬅ combat 🕰 state 🙈🗽 before 🤣💭 the last ♿❗ Gravity ⏬⏬ Orb is tagged. 
        - Potential applications: To avoid 🙅🙅 dropping combat and ☠ losing adren during Bring 📉➡ Him Down, 😩🏽 do 👌 a ⏰ defensive ability 👉 during 🚣🏃 the 😈👪 spam 🔁 click 🖱🖱 mechanic, such 😲😯 as 😎🏿 anticipate. 😛 

.
⬥ **__Phase 3__** 😏
.tag:miscp3
    • **Scopulus – Aggro**
        - The Scopulus aggro seem to be 🐝 random 🔀🎲 though 💥💭 there are 😤 a 👌 couple ways 🏻 to trigger 😤 a 💰🏼 reaggro. 1) 〰🌫 If 🅱👏 a 🚟 player 🤷 is constantly in motion, 😐😐 the 😫 Scopulus tend to 💦 aggro them 🎆 more. 🙅 2) A player 😤🤷 with ↔ an 🔥🍎 Ice Nihil will 🐼🍆 tend to 👏🔵 draw 🔙 more 💦➕ aggro, due 👅👅 to 💦 the 🎅 Ice ❄💎 Nihil’s special ✈☄ effect 📣 acting on 😎➡ the Scops.
        - Potential applications: Bring a 👏👌 Smoke 🌳🚬 Nihil on 🔛 Scop rotations to 😱🏻 avoid 🙅 drawing aggro.
    • **Vitalis – Base Spot 😂 and 😍 Vitalis Spawn**
        - If 👏 Vorago is not 🙅🚫 moved from 😂💋 the initial 💰 dropdown spot, 🏠💦 the 🕵👏 Vitalis Orb will always be sent 📬✉ North, 💈☝ North ☝💈 East, 👉 or East. 👉 If 🎵 Vorago is moved ⛷ from 💥 the ♀ initial 💇💰 dropdown spot, 😩😩 the 🍆😂 Vitalis Orb can be send 🚮📨 in any direction. 
        - Potential application: Avoid moving Vorago to have 🙈🙈 a 💰💰 predictable Vitalis Orb spawn. 
.
    • **Vitalis – Max Vitalis**
        - The ⚰ maximum number 🔢 of Vitalis that can 💰 fill 🤤✊ the room 🏚 in 🚫🏼 Normal 🖖🖖 Mode is 15, 📬 the 👈 max in 🚗 Hard Mode is ❌💦 25. 👏 In 😂 Normal 🖖🖖 Mode, the 🎁 number 🎦 of 🔴💦 Vitalis spawning per 👼👼 Orb is 🏻🤔 5 😱🛐 on 🔛🏿 p3 and 👏👏 p4, and 👏💰 2-4 😩 on 😳 p5. In ☝👏 Hard 💵🍆 Mode, there are 🙏 7 💯💯 Vitalis on 😩🔛 p5 and p9, and 👏👎 between 3 🤔 to 5 😂🍆 on 🔛🏿 p10 and 👏🤔 p11.

        - A 🗑 Vitalis minion 🍌 is still treated as 🕘🍑 a physical object 👮 while 👶♀ in 😏 its 👤📞 death 👻 animation. 🛌💦 
        - Potential application: If surrounded 👀 by Vitali, be ➡🅱 vary of 💦👏 their 👈🏼 death 💀 animations still 👉 counting 🛫 as a ❌❤ physical 💏 object. 👷👷 Same 😂💁 applies to Waterfall 💦 on P4, your 👃 character 👺 will attempt to path 🛣 around the 👏🌊 dying Vitalis which 👏 may 💖 lead ❤👨 to exiting the waterfall 💦💦 prematurely. See 👀😤 clip:
.
https://youtu.be/-HOB3kLpHgI 😮🤑
.
    • **Teamsplit – Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks**
        - During 🏃 the ⬆ teamsplit mechanic, if 👏🤔 you 😡👌 attempt to 👅 cast an 👹👹 auto 🤖🤖 attack 🤼⚔ on 🔛 Vorago while 🕗👶 outside 🚭 the 👏🚮 max cast distance, your character will run into the 🅱🎁 max cast distance in 👻 an 🤔 attempt to cast your spell. Often 😵 times ⏳⏲ this ⬆👅 results 🔢 in 👤 a 🙃👌 player leaving the 💞⛓ teamsplit box early 🕐🥂 and taking ✋ 8k damage. 
        - Potential application: Do 😍 not 🚫 attempt to 💰✌ auto cast while 🕑 in 👏👏 teamsplit unless you 💦👈 are 🚫 certain you 👉😀 are ✅⛔ within 👌 7 ⏰💯 squares to Vorago. 
    • **Teamsplit – Hard 🍆 Mode**
        - The 💰 teamsplit boxes 🤒 in hardmode, although 😛😛 appearing to 😖 be 💰🐝 only 1x1, are ❓ actually 😱 1x2. The 👏 square directly ➡➡ east 👉👉 of the 👑 1x1 square is also ➕☹ safe to ♂😛 stand ⛱ on. The 😜 same 🅱👭 applies to 💉💩 the teamsplit boxes 🤒🤒 on p10 and 💦😽 p11. 
        - Potential application: Another ♂🏻 safe square to ⛔😱 stand 🕺 on 🔛🔛 for 🍆 team split. 🚻 
    • **The End 🔚 – Glitch out 💯 of Arms**
        - It 💨 is 👏🤔 possible 🔝🔝 to 👩😩 glitch out of ☪ the arms during 🚣🏃 the 🌽 mechanic by 🍂 standing 🔪 directly ➡ on the 🔎 South 👇👇 line, or ➕ East line, 💨 in 👌 the ❄ respective quadrants. When 🍑💕 Vorago’s arm 👌 crosses said 🙈🙅 line, your character 🙉🙈 is ❌💦 free 😂 to move out 🤷 into the open 💰 arena. Note 📝 that 🙌 if you do 😤👌 not move ♂🏃 after 🅰 “glitching out” 💦😲 and stay 👀 standing 🏿🏿 on the South 👇👇 or East 👉🌍 line, 💨 you 👈😎 will be forced 😲😩 back ⬅🔙 into 👉 the arms 🙌🅱 mechanic. 
        - Potential applications: DPS can glitch out 😳☝ of arms 💦 and set ✴👌 up 🔝 their 🅾 Sun 😩 with 👏 ample space.
    • **The End 🔜 – Bombs 💣 after 👀😏 Phase**

⬥ **__Phase 4__** 💦💦
.tag:miscp4
    • **Waterfall 💦 – First Spawn**
        - The first 👏 spawn of 💦 the waterfall 💦 will 🤷🖕 never ♂ be on 🔛 the 💦 North East 🌍👉 corner 💀 of 🗼 the ♋🤔 arena. 
        - Potential applications: That 💵 is one ☝ less 😔 corner ⤵ you 🐶 have 👏 to consider ☺🤔 for waterfall 💦 upon 🙁 dropdown.
    • **Waterfall 💦 – Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks**
        - Initiating an 👏 auto attack ⚔ while 🕗 standing 🏿🏿 in 👉 waterfall 💦 will ♀ force 👊👊 your character to 😘 run into 📥 max cast distance and often outside 🚭🚭 of 💦 the 😶 waterfall. 💦💦 
        - Potential applications: Avoid 🙅🙅 using 🏻 auto 🤖 attacks on Vorago while 🤔⏳ standing 🏿🏿 in waterfall. 💦💦
    • **Waterfall 💦💦 – Corners 📦 of 💦🈸 the 🌟💯 Waterfall** 💦💦
        - The 👫🌧 corners 📦📦 of 💦 the 🕰👏 waterfall 💦💦 (excluding the 💰🌽 NE, 🔥 SE, NW, SW corner) are not considered 🤔 part 🤑 of the 🐈🍬 waterfall.

.
    • **Stone 🗿 Clone – Vorago Melee Animation** 🍆
        - Upon 💰 summoning a stone ☄🙌 clone, Vorago will perform ☝👌 a 👌 melee swipe animation. 🛌🛌 This melee swipe animation is non-damaging 🏆 and 💰 is 💦 only 👏👏 cosmetic. 
        - Potential applications: Do 💕 not try to 👌 res this 🙄 attack 🤼🤼 as 🍑🕖 it won’t 💪💪 hit 👊👊 anything. 🙌 
    • **Stone Clone – No 🙅⛔ target**
        - If 🚟😩 the stone clone target dies ☠💀 on 🔛 the same tick, or shortly after 👀⏳ the stone 🙌 clone spawns, 🤑🤑 the 👶 stone clone will 🙅😩 stand 🚶 idle for 🍆 a 💦 couple seconds 😫 before ⬇ reaggroing to ⏱ another 🏻 person. However, 🤔 the new player 💰🤷 cannot 😡❌ attack ⚔ the stone clone back as they are 🈶 not the 👏🅰 stone 🗿☄ clones’ original 💯 target. The stone clone will 😳 eventually 🕗🕗 despawn.
    • **Teamsplit – Third 🤔 Waterfall** 💦
        - The 🙌🙌 teamsplit mechanic after 👀🕑 the 💪 third waterfall 💦💦 is 💪😜 currently ⌚🚟 glitched. Vorago is 🤔😤 still attackable during 🚣 the teamsplit and 👅 if 🙎 attacked, Vorago will 🤤👏 proceed 🚶🚶 with 👏😍 his rotation and 💰 throw 😷 three 💁 blues, followed by bleeds. This means 😼 the 🚑 team 🐒 will 🏼👏 have to tank 3 👏🕑 blues 💙 without any ❌ defensives and 💰 be 😐🐝 ready 😤👊 to 💦 immediately 💰 deal with 👀 bleeds out 😓 of team split.
        - Potential applications: DO 👀⚠ NOT 🙅 ATTACK 🤼⚔ Vorago as 🍑👍 teamsplit is 💦🈶 about 💭👏 to 💦 spawn. This 🖖 prevents ♀♀ Vorago from 🍆😮 sending blues during the 📖💯 teamsplit.

        - Potential application: Good 😀👍 for revo users 😏 to 💰💦 MD and be ready to clear 📝📝 bleeds on 🔛🔥 tick.
    • **P5 Voke**
        - Due 👅👅 to how 🤔😕 P5 is set 👌📚 up, 🙆❤ a player 👨 cannot ⛔ voke Vorago during p5. The ♀ ability 👉👉 will simply ⤵ not 😂 activate when pressed. 
        - Potential application: None.
    • **Melee Dismember on Reflects**
        - If 🙎🔎 a player 💰🎮 applies the 👶 dismember melee ability 👉👉 on 🔛 reflects to 👏👮 another 🏻🏊 player, 📅😤 and 💰👏 the 🅱 victim player receives the 👏🅱 first bleed, 😳 the first 🏻😎 bleed 💉💉 damage ☠☄ will 👏📌 immediately apply 😤 the 👨 4500 damage ☠☠ as 😅🍑 if the 👏 player 🎮😤 was 👏😏 taking a second ☝🕐 bleed 💉😳 from 🅱👉 Vorago without clearing the 💦 first 😎 bleed. 😳 This is 💦👉 most likely an 👏 oversight. It ♂😠 is 🔥 unknown if this ⬆👉 works 👷 on 🔛🏽 p2, p3, and 😲 p4.  
        - Potential applications: Prank your teammates by 🏳😈 putting 🙌🙌 a 🚨 dismember on 🔛➡ them 👩💭 during 🚣🏃 reflects. 
.
    • Stall and Auto 🤖 Attacks
        - Vorago begins his attack 🤼🤼 pattern the 🕑🌑 tick after 😡 the target cycle tick. His 👑 attack 🤼⚔ speed ⏩ varies:
        - His 💦 attack speed ⏩⏩ will ⚽😛 be 4 💦👀 ticks if the 👏 last ❗😯 action 😏🤚 he 👨 performed was either being 😑 pushed forwards or 😇👉 being pushed back 🗣
        - His 👉💰 attack ⚔🤼 speed ⏩⏩ will be 3 💵❤ ticks if 🚫 the 👏👪 last 😰 action he 👨♂ performed was 😒 attacking, ♂ whether ☂ it 🤷 be 🐝😡 a 🏽🏿 special attack, blue ♂ bomb, or melee swipe. This ☣😎 includes if 👻👏 he pushes and 🏿 attacks in 👤 the 💰⛓ same tick.
        - As 💑🕘 you can 🔫🔫 attack 🤼 Vorago on the target cycle tick, which is before he 🔑👂 releases the first 🔢 spec, you 👉 can 🅱🍞 delay the 😊😩 release of the first special 💯💯 attack. 🤼🤼
        - Potential applications: 0-Linking 😊 green bomb/vitalis; 0-Specing ❌
        - Vorago can only 😤 be 🤰 pushed once 🕓🕓 in ➡ either 🚫🤷 direction on 🔛🔛 any 🔥 given ⤴⤵ tick.
.
    • Damaged Required ✅ to 🆔🔨 Push
        - Pushing 🖐🖐 Vorago one tile entails dealing 🚬 20k damage ☠ to him. As soon as this 🏼👉 20k threshold 🤝 is hit, 🔞👊 the 🌊 damage counter resets to 🎲 0 😏 for 👀🎅 the next 🤗⏩ tile.
        - For example, if you deal one hit of damage that deals 30k damage to Vorago, 30k damage is added to the damage counter, then the game performs a check to see if that total value is at least 20k. It finds that 30,000 >= 20,000 holds true, so Vorago pushes a tile and then the counter is reset to 0, effectively losing 10,000 damage. This 10,000 damage is referred to as “overkill”.
        - As an alternative example, presume you deal three individual hits of 10,000 damage on the same tick. The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn’t cause it to push. The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0. Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 >= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as “overflow”. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow.
        - As a 🅰 final example, 🔥🔥 suppose there is one ♿ last 🕞 hit of 10,000 damage on 🔛🔛 that 👀🚟 tick. Again, 😬🤡 this 👀 10,000 ⬆😰 is 🈁 added ➕➕ to 💦🆒 the 👧⏩ damage ☄☠ counter as 👦😰 before, 🍆🤔 for 👉 a 💰👌 total 😏🌬 of 👶 20,000 📊📊 damage. ☄ The 🌈🕵 game 🎮 performs the same ❗😯 check and finds that 😩👏 20,000 is 😂 in 🏽🔙 fact 🏫🏫 at 👉👉 least 👏 20,000, 🎉 so the 😍💪 damage ☠ counter resets. Vorago cannot ⚠😡 be pushed twice ✌✌ on 📱🔛 the 🚟🌃 same ❗ tick, so 💯 hitting 😦 this 40,000 damage mark in 🕺 one 🏻☝ tick may 💖 actively be 👦 detrimental to 🔟✌ a 👌 kill, 😀 as you will end 😂 up 🙅 losing 👏👏 20,000 damage.

> __**Vorago Crack Healing**__
.tag:crackheal
During 🏃🏃 a phase 🌒🌗 transition at Vorago, your 💕 character 👺🙉 is 😍😠 immune for 1 🌱 tick. 
You 😫 can take advantage of 💥 this by 😈 using the spell Heal Other 🎴🏾 from the 👏👏 Lunar Spellbook and 👏💦 cast the ♀ heal at the same 🖕 time as 💰 a 😱👌 phase 🌑 transition. Normally, Heal Other will 👏🙋 take 👧 hp from 😂 your 🏧 character and transfer it to ♂💦 your target player; 🎮🎮 this results 🔢🔢 in 👏👏 a 👌📣 large 🏯🏯 3-7k 💦💯 typeless "hit" 👊 on 🏽 your 🤗🏻 character that is 🍅💦 unavoidable.
However, 🖐😐 as your character 👺 is 🤔💦 immune during a phase 🌗🌓 transition, the Heal Other will not damage ☄☠ your character. 🙉🙈 Thus, your 👉 target player 🏋👨 will 👊 gain 🔑 hp at no 🚫 cost 💸💲 to you.
This works on any phase transition at Vorago in both normal mode and hard mode (with the exception of p10 -> p11 at hard mode).

How 😐 to perform 🎭 a 👌 crack ☑🌫 heal:
1) ♂ Be 🎮🐝 on 🔛🍌 the 😤👏 Lunar Spellbook and select the 🍂 spell 💪 Heal Other 😤
2) Click your target player 😤 when the 📖 floor 🤣 shows 📺📺 cracks, right before 😳 it 😠 collapses

Note: 👌🎵 Your target player must have 🈶 Accept Aid turned 🔄 ON ➡👎 in ♂ their 🎉 settings.
Note: 👋 if 👏 you mess 🔇 up and 😟🏻 perform the 👏🚑 Heal Other 👪💦 too ❓ early/late, 🥂🥂 the spell will 👏 take hp from 🌎👉 your character and 💛 transfer it to 💰 your 😍💯 target.
Note: Heal Group can 🔫 be ☃ used as 👌 well, though 💭 it requires your target player(s) 😤 to be 🐝😠 within 👌 1 🤜❌ square of 🤓 you. 😍 Easiest way ➡ to 💦 achieve 😌 this 💧 is to ask your 👉🅱 partner 💞💗 to 👳 follow 👣👣 you, ♀👉 or 💰💯 vice versa.

> **__Skipping Debilitate on P5__ (Courtesy of <@175995416955977728>)**
.tag:debil
Debilitate should 😑👶 be ✔💨 skipped after bleeds because 💁💁 while 🙌🤔 it does 👏✊ have a 🐭 chance 🙅 of 💦😍 blocking push 🏽🏽 back, 🔙😌 it can 🚫 negatively impact stall. This ⬆ is 😍⁉ most notable on 🌞 the 💥🍑 TeamSplit rotation because 😜 the person who 🔭😂 suns relies heavily 😃😃 on stall to 🆒 use 💁😬 their threshes before 🔙🤔 TeamSplit. While ⏳🕗 this 👈🎊 is not 🙅 as 🌐 harmful on 🔛 other 👭 rotations, it ☠ may still prevent players from 👉 using the full 🈵👏 duration of their sunshine. The dps of 🐶 two or three 💁🕛 players 💰💰 is 😒 typically greater than 🙅 Vorago's push ✋ back. 🔙⬅ Thus, 😮😂 it 💯 is better to 👉 skip debilitate in ⤵📥 favor of 👏🔥 higher ✅🔝 damage ☄ abilities to 👐 both 👬 induce stall from taking ✋👉 damage ☄☄ and 🏻✔ dealing 🚬🏾 more 😤🍆 damage ☠☠ overall. 

1st ❌❌ blue 👁♂ sent 👉✉ out 🅱
2nd blue 👁 sent ✉ out
1st blue hits and 👅 creates stall
2nd blue 🙆 hits 🎯 and 👏🙏 creates stall
3rd 👀 blue 👄 sent out 😜🍆
Teamsplit
3rd blue 🙆♂ hits 👊 and 👏 creates stall (while he 😨👏 is 🎃😂 no 🙅🏻 longer attackable)

In 👏 the above scenario Vorago pushes back 3 times and 👏💰 you 👨 can ✈🔫 only take 😃 advantage of 🍒 2 🚗💕 times 😭🕑 he 😨 stalls, 🎺🎷 2 of which 🥙🎓 are 😻🈶 3 🗣🔀 ticks apart.

Now 👇 lets ⚠ look 👀 at 🕛😠 what Debilitating does.
1st blue 💙 sent ✉ out
2nd blue 👁 sent ✉👉 out 👅
1st ❌❌ blue hits 🎯 
3rd 👀👀 blue 🔵👁 sent ✉ out 💦
2nd blue 🙆🙆 hits 👊 and 👏 creates stall
Teamsplit
3rd blue 💙🙆 hits 🎯 and creates stall (while 🕗 he is no longer attackable)

Debilitating prevents the 👏 first 🥇 blue 🙆🙆 from 💦👉 stalling vorago which 👏 means 😏😏 that the 🤔 third 🤔 blue 🙆💙 gets sent ✉📬 out, 😐💰 allowing his 👑 teamsplit attack to 💧😔 happen 💁💁 much 😩 earlier

If ☔🙎 you have 😄 disruption shield, ⚗⚗ it is 🍅👅 best to use 👏 it 👏 on 📲🔛 the 👨 second blue ♂🏼 and 🙇 to 💦🍅 asphyxiate instead of 🏻 debilitating.

.tag:brokents
“Breaking” ⛔ a 🏽 teamsplit involves Vorago continuing his attack ⚔ rotation during a 👦🍂 teamsplit. This 👈 is 👊☝ beneficial during 🚣 phase 🌒 4, as it can ❗ speed up 🏽❤ the 💳 phase. However, this is ☝🅱 harmful on phases 3 ❤😏 and 😲👏 5, 🔳 as it 🙂💖 gives 😚😚 you 🔥🚀 less time 👋 to 💦👁 attack the 👏 boss. 😂

When 🍑😂 the teamsplit is 🗡🈶 broken, 🍌🤕 Vorago can 🔫 still 😽 use 🖐 both 🌜 melee attacks and 🆗👏 blue bombs, 💣 so 🆙👏 keep 👩👌 in 👇 mind 😏👨 to 👏♀ eat 😝 up if necessary to 💦💦 not ❌🙏 die 😷 to this. 👈👈

To 💦💦 break 💥 the 💞 teamsplit, you 👆 need 🙅😂 to use mutated barge and 🙌 then 😁❓ apply 😤 one ☝😫 of your 💯⛓ melee channeled abilities as 👦 a ☝🎉 bleed 😳😳 directly before 🤔 the 🔑⛓ teamsplit. It does not 😅 matter 🏻 which 👏 ability 👉👉 you use (flurry, assault, or destroy), 🤜💥 however 🖐 the 👨🚿 tick that you apply 😤 the 💡 bleed on 🔛 DOES 😳 effect 📣🐆 how 💯 quickly ⏰🆘 the ❄ teamsplit is 🈁😞 broken. 💯 Some ticks result in 👇👏 attacks starting slower 😩😩 during 🏃🚣 the 👑👩 teamsplit, meaning 🚫❌ the 😈 phases lasts longer, 🕚😖 where 🤷😾 others result in the attacks starting 🤠🤠 sooner in teamsplit, meaning 🚫❌ the phase doesn’t last ♿🙅 as long. ♂  A 💰😧 consistent way 👉✋ break 💔 the 🅿 teamsplit on 👌💦 a 🎹 fast tick is 💦 to 🔵 barge immediately 🤣 after the 🏻👏 6th blue 😂♂ bomb 💦💥 is released after 🕑 the clone and then bleed 😳💉 destroy 🔫🍆 exactly one ♿♿ global cooldown later. Keep in mind 💪 to 💦 stop 🚫🛑 attacking before 🐝 your 👩💯 barge to get 🉐😢 the buff. 💪

If done correctly, bleeds will come 💦 immediately 🤣 after 👀👀 a phase 4 👀 teamsplit. The 🙏😱 first bleed 💉💉 received is 🏻 somewhat invisible, similar 👱 to ⬇ the 📖 first 🏻😊 bleed 😳💉 on 😎👀 phase 👏 2, 💦😍 so 💯🌃 make 🙇 sure ✔😉 to watch ♀😄 out for 🍆💰 that. 🍆👉 In 🍆 addition, ➕ you can 🔝🤖 sometimes lose aggro, so make 🖍 sure to 💋💦 voke.

Both ➡ barge and 👏🔛 the 👏 bleed following can ♂ splash and 😂 you 🙏 will 🍆🅱 still ⏰ break 😲 the teamsplit.

.tag:tc
Target cycling 🚴🚴 is 😩 extremely 🤤 useful at 👏 Vorago for 😏🍆 multiple reasons. It 💯💦 allows you ✅👈 to 💱 attack ⚔ both scopulus on spawn, luring them 👨 extremely 😂 easily without 🙅🤚 issue. 🏾🏾 It 🚫💦 can 🔫 also ➕ let 🙆 you 🅱♀ attack Vorago before ⬅ he 🎅👨 becomes immune to a dropdown special 👋 attack, 🤼🤼 like 😄 the 👏⬆ first waterfall, 💦💦 TeamSplit, or Purple ☂ Bomb. On the ♀💵 final 😪🔮 phase, you 🤔👉 can 🔫 push 👉 forward ⏭ Vorago before 😈 he does ❓ a 😠👌 dropdown special ✈ attack, 🤼 which creates push stall, allowing you 👉👆 to ☢ do 😤👏 an 😣 additional ability. 

In order 🤜🤜 to target cycle Vorago on 🎶➡ tick properly, ☑ you 🚫 must 🙋👏 know 💭 2 🏻 important 😍✅ timings. 

__Timing 1__: ♂ Phase 🌔🌘 Transition 'Crack' 💔💔
This 🤔 timing is 🤔💦 very 👤💁 easy, as 👦 the 👄👏 crack animation 🍑 is 🅱 3 ❤ ticks long, and you 🏻 just need to use 🖐 movement ability 👉👉 like 🏻 Surge, Escape, or 🚨🅱 Bladed Dive on 🔥 the ♀🚿 third 🤔 tick. Alternatively, you can 💦😬 use 👏👏 Provoke on 🔛 a 🎀 training 🚣🚴 dummy/Vitalis, 😘❤ or 😩 learn 👨🏫 the 😦 timing with any 🤔 other 💰 ability 👉 such as anticipate, 😛 although the easiest and 🅱🙏 most 🤚💯 beneficial one is 🕤 to use Escape, as 🍑💰 that 😐 let's 🙆 you easily 😂 cast Heal Other 🏭 while staying in 💀🍌 range of your partner.

The 💦 first tick is 🤔 when 😩 the 💰🦁 crack ☑☑ first 🥇🏻 appears, and 👅 the third 🤔🤔 tick is 😐 when 💦 you ❤🏿 use 🏾 surge.
To 💦🙊 help, 😢 set a 🐝 metronome to 🌈🔨 100 💯💯 bpm, count 🙌 to 2 🍝😳 when 🍆 the 🕑🍆 crack 🌫💔 appears, then use 👏ℹ surge.
Once 🔥 you 🔥 get the 🎺 timing down in ⤵ your head 🦊 it 💯💪 is 💯 hard 😤😤 to mess up 🙅👅 during 🏃 the 👗🌐 kill. 💀

__Timing 2__: 💬 Mobile 📱📱 Cooldown
Cooldowns go 😜⏩ around 🐋🔄 360 degrees on ➡👋 your abilities clockwise, and 👏🚫 keeping clocks ⏰ in 🎮 mind, 💦 we can 🔫🔫 use 👏👏 this 🏋❓ to 😫 help 😬💁 make 🖌 learning 🤗 the 😶 target cycle timing much 🕵 easier. 9 seconds 😫🕥 after your surge/escape with 😋👫 mobile 📱 perk, ⏫ your 👏 ability 👉👉 will 👄😡 be 🏻🐝 at 🅱 10 😰🕳 o' clock on 1 tick and 😟✊ 11 o'clock 🔫💰 on another 📺 tick.

.tag:centre
Knowing ☣🤔 how to walk 🏃🏃 Vorago is ❤ useful for moving him 👴😓 on 👋👌 phase 👏🌕 2. 👌💁 

First ☝ determine his 👏 walking direction. Step 👞 one tile under Vorago and 👏 immediately 👏🤣 cast an 👏 ability 👉👉 to ⬆ walk him 👨💦 one ☝ tile in his 🌾👿 walking ♀ direction. 
(note: 🗒 if 👏👏 you do not 🕵😧 cast an 👹 ability he 🙀👈 may 🦋 walk 🚶 on 💦 top 🔼 of 👬💦 you and 👏👅 around 🔃 to the 👩 other 🏿💃 side)

Once you 💦 determine Vorago's walking 🍑 direction, it is easiest to 💦 manipulate his position from 👈 the 😂👏 opposite side, i.e. 👀😑 if 🅱👏 Vorago is 💦 walking 🚶🍑 west, stand 🚶🚏 on 🔛🏿 the east 👉🌍 side 🙋💵 of 💦👨 him. 🛐👅 

In order to 💦🌅 move Vorago, he 🔑👨 must 😩💯 be 💀 following you. ❤ During 🏃 phase 🌕 2, 💦 Vorago does not 🚫🙅 follow 👣👣 between the 👏 red 🔴 bomb and 💆 start ⏸ of bleeds. This 🍉 means 😏 if 👉👩 you 👇👏 step 📈👞 out 👉 of 💦🎵 melee distance expecting Vorago to ⬆🙅 follow 👣👣 you after 💦 the red, ♨❤ he 👨 will 🏼💦 stand 🕴 there 👌 until 🕛 bleeds begin. 💦 However, 🖐🖐 he 🗣👉 can 🔫 be walked ♂ under ⬇❌ which will 👑🏼 cause 🔄 him 😂💕 to 🔥 move 😎🏃 in 👉 the direction he is 🙈 walking.

If Vorago is 💰😂 walking south, 👇 go ♂🏃 west and 🌈💦 bladed dive onto 🖥 the 🚦🅱 square marked ✒ with 👫👏 the 😎 blue blubber jellyfish

**__Introduction__**
A 🙀 Stone 😤 Clone in 🕺 Phase 🌑 4 / 9 🈂🎉 always 😣💯 targets a 🚕 person 🙎🙎 that 💰 Vorago does not 🙅 hold 👀👫 aggression towards ⛪ (the 👏🅱 Base 👺👺 Tank). In 💀 other 👪 words, the Base 😵🙄 Tank never receives a 🏽 Stone 🗿🗿 Clone. It has been 🥜 discovered 😎🚢 in ⏳ scenarios where you 👉♂ end in 👏🌞 a 👏 Solo 👆 Phase 🌓 4, that 💵✔ Vorago will 🐼 bug 🐛🐛 for a 👏🏻 few ticks and 🎅 then 💯😮 proceed 🚶🚶 with 👐 the 💯🏞 weekly special, skipping the 👏🗺 Stone 🗿🗿 Clone and its 🐶👤 following 7 🔥✨ auto 🤖🤖 attacks completely. In 🚪💆 place of creating 👏👏 the ⭐👑 Stone Clone, Vorago bugs 🐞 for 🍀 12 ⬜🤐 ticks and 💰💰 skips all 7 auto attacks which 🙌 equates to 👐💦 a total 📈 of 💦 56 ticks (33.6s) saved.

.
**__Overview__**
⬥ One player vokes <:voke:535541259465392143>, underwalks Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082> and lures him to whatever wall he's walking towards.

⬥ All 💯🙋 other players quickly position at 💯 the 💊 opposite ↩ side of 💰🔴 the 🍑 arena, so 💦😎 that they 👨😢 leave 🚫🚫 the 🔥 visibility 👁👁 range 💦💦 to Vorago.

⬥ Due 👅👅 to 💦💰 the 📩 Base 👺 Tank being the 🚗 only 🕦 visible player 💰 in 📥🔥 the 🎆⤵ arena, Vorago will 👄👏 skip the 👏 Stone 🚬 Clone and 👏 its 👉💰 following 7 💯💯 auto attacks.

⬥ Vorago will 🏼💍 continue 🏃 his 🏻👉 attack ⚔🤼 order ❌🎁 with the weekly special 💅 mechanic.

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ Toggle off 💰😝 running 🏃 once 🅱🏳 you enter 💦 the 👏🍰 Waterfall. 💦

⬥ Post-Waterfall: Either use Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> as your first ability or Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> within your first ability's GCD

*Note: On Team Split, use the Mobile perk <:mob:689501908628799488> with gBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> if you plan on breaking the TS.*

⬥ Walk 🏼🚶 towards Vorago's walking 🚶♀ direction (do 😧👌 not 🚫 run). 🏃

⬥ Toggle on running 🏃 as 👂🚫 Vorago reaches the wall. 🎸⌨

⬥ The moment that Vorago starts moving, all other players should immediately position at the opposite side of Vorago's walking direction (utilise Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>).

⬥ Once 💦🔂 the 👏 Stone Clone special mechanic is 😳💦 skipped, move ♂🔛 back 😔😎 to the 😱➕ Base 😵👺 Tank

**__Important Notes__**
Due to the incredible amount of time gained by a Clone Skip, Barricade <:cade:535541306353778689> will mostly no longer be available for each weekly special mechanic. Due to this it is required to alternate Barricades between the Base and Bomb Tank. Preferably the Bomb Tank barricades the first cycle so that it will be ready in case of a Phase 5 / 10 Barricade.
