.tag:how
This guide includes rotations and 🔛 strategies for 😩 the 🤴 entire 🌳😂 kill, 👻☠ separated phase by phase. 🌑 Within 👌 these 🤢 sections there are subsections for when the 👏 duo and 👅 4 💦 man strategies differ; these 🔫 are 🔢 preceded by 🍭😈 (duo) or (4 man) 🌊👨 headers respectively. When strategies subsequently converge they 👧🗓 are preceded by the “All sizes:” header. 

Additionally, ➕➕ to reduce the ⚰👗 verbosity of 💦 this 🖖👈 guide, each 👏 section 📦 has 🅰 a 💓👉 short 👉💁 summary detailing the 🏽🆘 general ♂ strategy and 💃 ult rotation for the respective phase. 🌗

.
> __**Introduction:**__
.tag:intro
This 👅🔽 section 📦 of 👏 the 👨🍆 Solak guide aims to 💦😷 provide the current 😤 meta rotations and 👏 explain additional strategies for 🍆🌍 the 😼🍑 smoothest kills 😵 possible 🔝 for both 🌜 duo and 👏 4 man 😍 kills. To 📧💯 give 🛍 an 👏🦅 idea 😂🤣 of 👏 the 🅱 kill speeds assumed with ↔ these strategies, below is 🈁 a 💰🏻 list 🤔 of 💰👏 benchmarks to 🅱 aim for:
    • P1 root skip
    • P1 1 cycle core
    • P2 SE erupt skip (killing 🔪 both 👏🌜 southern eruptions before ⏪ being cleansed)
    • P2 climb ♀ skip (4 💦😘 man 👨♂ only) 👬
    • P2 2nd rain skip (duo only) 👬💯
    • P3 2 😍💕 pad 😍 
    • P3 1 ♂🆘 cycle elf (duo only)
    • P4 no realm 📯

Overall, expect ~6:20 🤘 duo and 😽👏 ~5:40 🍆 4 👀 man kill 💀🔫 times. 🕐🕔

Notably, this guide will NOT 🙅🚫 cover 💦 rotations/tips for 💦 storm tanking P2. While 🕗🤔 storm ⛈💦 tanking can 🔫👍 speed ⏩ up kills by 😈 as 🍑 much 💯 as 👍 10+ seconds, 😫 the 🌊 risk involved is 😣🈶 generally considered too 😁 high ☝👍 to 💦⛪ be 🐝🐝 worth 🌐💰 it 😖😂 for 🍆💰 overall kills ☠ per 👼 hour. 

.
> __**Overview of roles:**__
.tag:roles
⬥ __**Duo:**__
Base: Bleeds first P1, stays down P2, uses all bleeds P3.
DPS: ZGS specs first ☝ P1, goes 🚋 up twice P2
The above 😩👆 roles are not ♂ mutually exclusive to any 🌐💦 other 🏻💰 bleed 💉 usage (i.e. 👀👦 either player can 🙂🤸 bleed elf/pre-bleed 🐇🐇 P4).

⬥ __**Pre-fight:**__
All members of the team should overload on Spirit Weed, Lantadyme, and (optionally) Kwuarm incense sticks. When all team members are ready, they should overload at the bank (only 1 dose is necessary for the entire fight). Start building adrenaline, and once done, all team members should DBA spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> (or, preferably, EOF spec with a DBA amulet).

```Summary: All 💯 players 💰 should 👫 sigil zerk and 😲 ZGS spec. Use 👏 bled assault and 👖 hurricane in 📥 zerk, then 🤔😗 use ⚒ both again in 🔝🏠 ZGS. The 🔯 base 😵👺 should 💘 use all 🙀👨 TMW spear bleeds before 🤣 ZGS, while 🕗👱 the 👏👏 DPS should use 👏🖐 all bleeds after ZGS.

You and your partner should mine <:dommine:662249620579155968> the roots shown in the image below in the section on roots. Before starting, the base should use an ability such as Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> or Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to signal to the DPS that they are about to engage Solak. Both players should then use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and proceed to do the following rotations:

Only 1 ❌ DPS should bleed 😳 after 👀👀 ZGS spec in 4 🤐 man. 🙏🙏

Note that it is generally a good idea to walk Solak south at the beginning of the fight until he is roughly in the centre of the arena - this makes it so that pads are easier to <:bd:535532854281764884> to and from.

.
__**P1 roots:**__ 📚
Properly handling roots is crucial to an efficient P1. Without prior communication or assumptions about strategy, it can be easy to overkill or waste mines on roots. Below are diagrams for the roots that should be mined and attacked by each person. Remember that roots can be bound and flanked. As a rule of thumb, any roots **NOT** in sunshine range should be *meleed*, to take advantage of TMW dismember <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:dismember:535532879376023572> + tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, as well as stronger basics.

.
Note 📝🗒 that roots should 👌😎 only 👨😍 be 🍆 targeted after Solak has been 🔙🚟 phased to **2.25m** 💦😩 (**3.75m** in 👮 4 💦 man). 🏿 If he 🤠😡 is above 🔝 the 😈 HP cap, he 👨 will do 😠 the 🦁 roots 😇📚 spec (marked tile with timer) at 👏 1:06 🌸🤢 on the 😍 boss timer. If 👏 the cap has 👩👏 been 👏 hit, 👊🏼 he 🍆 will phase into ⬇☔ arms/legs. 🙆🙆 

.
__**Duo**__
After sunning, the base should mine <:dommine:662249620579155968> the southernmost root on the west side. <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:bd:535532854281764884> back to your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, and kill the two roots shown below in your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. The DPS should mine <:dommine:662249620579155968> the northernmost root on the east side, and kill the two roots shown below. If the abilities shown below do not kill roots completely, it’s fine to ignore them unless they are very high health (5k+), or if the previous root (the next anticlockwise root) is alive also, since roots heal in a clockwise pattern. 

.
__**4-Man**__
In 4 man, there are more specific root roles. The base and 2 DPS will “sun arms”, which means they will <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the usual duo spot. The 2 DPS that sun with the base should handle the NW and SE roots. The last DPS should <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> on the east side to target the E-NE root in their <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

.
Due to 💦🔎 the 👉 diminishing-returns nature of Solak’s scalability, in 👄 4 man 🤒🏽 (or 💁 larger) team 💰 sizes you ☝👨 will find that 😐😐 you 🙇🏿 will 💩💦 hit 🎵 the 🖕🅱 HP cap of 🔌 3.75m 💦 much ➕ more ➕ quickly ⏰⏰ compared to duo. As 😐🍑 such, 😲 you 💦🏻 should 💘💘 make 🏻🏻 sure to kill 😛 all 🤵 roots ✝🛐 before 😂 getting 👏😚 on the 👏👏 limbs. 

.
__**P1 limbs (all sizes):**__
AoE abilities like <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:chain:535533833056026624> should be prioritised here. Stand in the spot shown in the diagram below in order to hit both arms with <:dbreath:535533833391702017>. In duo, the base should target the far arm and DPS should target the close arm. In 4 man, simply target the arm closest to you. Remember that left-click targeting for vuln bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> is quite tricky here and you will likely end up targeting Solak, so try to right click to vuln arms.

.
For legs, prioritise (4t) <:deto:535533833358016512>, <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, and <:chain:535533833056026624>. If they are relatively high hp (~30% or more on both legs) then the base can use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> and the DPS can use <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> <:wrack:535533809823645697>. Otherwise, get off the legs and build to <:zerk:535532854004678657> (or wait 2t if already 100 adren). 

.
Core: 💰
Before the legs die, all players should <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>. <:gbarge:535532879250456578> any surviving legs, along with <:cleave:535532878616985610> and <:deci:535532879325822986> if they are still not dead. <:bd:535532854281764884> to the core spawn location, <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> core, and proceed to do the following rotation:
<:cleave:535532878616985610> + <:deci:535532879325822986> (if not used on legs) → bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → <:deci:535532879325822986>

For 🚟 the sake of clarity: “activating cleanse” 🛁 refers to 💦 when the ✨ player clicks Merethiel to begin 💦 cleansing. “Getting 😧🍆 cleansed” refers to when 🍑💤 the 🅱 players 💰🎮 are 😡 actually 😬 cleansed of 👏 their 🍷 blight stacks. 💦💦

```Summary:
After 👊 the ⏩ core, all players should 👌 switch 🎚 to ♀✌ mage and 👏🏻 kill 🚬 the ☀☝ SW erupt, activating cleanse after your 3rd 👀 ability. Kill the SE erupt, get ♀❤ cleansed, and 💰 go ⏩♂ up 💍 the storm 🌀🌀 via 💰 the 🏿 SW circle. The 💅🏡 team should 💘 then 👀🔙 evenly split the 2 🚗🍆 northern 🎅🎅 erupts, with ❌ half 🅱😂 the 💰🏔 team 🏃 going 🏃🚕 up a second 🅾🥈 time 👏 to 💦👆 finish 🏁 off 💦 the 👉💦 storm. 💦💦 

Duo:
The 💌 base 😵 should 💦 sun, ☀ sigil zerk (or 👉💦 vice versa depending on 💦🔞 aggro), and 👏 ZGS spec. The 🍄🌊 DPS should sigil zerk after 👅 coming 🏃 down, sun ☀ and ZGS spec. The 👏 DPS should 💘💘 climb ♀ during 🏃 the arm 👌👌 spec. 

4 💦💦 man: 🍆😂
The ❤💌 base 😵😢 should 👫💘 sun, sigil zerk, and 💯 ZGS spec. The 👏 two elf 🐇 1 ❗ roles should 👫 kill and 😍🌬 go ⏩👆 up the 💰 same 💩❗ erupt, while the 🦉😠 base and ➡🍀 elf 2 kill 💀❎ the other 🎴 and stay down. ⬇ The elf 1’s should 😀 sigil zerk, sun, 🔥 and 👏 use thresholds until 🍆🕑 phased, while the 👧👏 base 😢 and elf 🐇 2 😞 sigil zerk, sun, 😩 and 👏 ZGS depending on 🙏 HP. Remember 💭 that 👇👉 P2 phases earlier (based 🔥💰 on HP) in a 💰 4 👨😘 man, so 😝😳 try 🏃 to be 👬 more 🤔 conservative with adrenaline 💉 in sun in order to 💦 get a good 👍 ZGS. Maintain high 🚬👑 adrenaline until Solak phase into 👉👉 P3 in order 🎁❌ to ➡ zerk right ✔ away.```

.
> __**Southern eruptions (all sizes):**__
.tag:south
All players should start on the SE erupt and use <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>, <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:conc:535533833106489365> → flanking <:impact:535533809655873556> on it. Right after <:impact:535533809655873556>, the cleanse should be activated and players should <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:bd:535532854281764884> to the SW erupt. Use <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:wm:535533809978966037> on it, or 3t <:asphyx:535533833072672778> if you missed ticks travelling between eruptions. Right after <:wm:535533809978966037>, run back to the middle to get cleansed, using a <:StormShards:536256663641128971> on Solak while doing so. You should be cleansed after sharding, so <:surge:535533810004262912> or <:bd:535532854281764884> to the SW circle to go up to the storm. Note that you will have to be tick perfect if using 5t <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, so just do 3t <:asphyx:535533833072672778> until you are comfortable with the cleanse timing. Also remember that the Inquisitor’s staff effect does not work on eruptions, so <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and <:wm:535533809978966037> should be done with dual wield.

.
> __**Northern eruptions:**__
.tag:north
If all 🐟💯 players 🎮 are using 🤳📤 the ❌ proper abilities on 🔛 the 👀 southern eruptions, they will 📃 always die before 🐝 the 🏼👏 cleanse. After 💦💦 coming 🏻 down from 🅱 the 💲 storm, the team 🏃💰 should 🤔😕 evenly split 🚻 damage ☄ between 👈 the 🥗 two ✌💏 northern erupts. Also remember to switch to 😩💦 melee for 🍆💕 the 🍆 northern 🎅🎅 erupts.

.
__**Duo:**__
Players can either decide pre-fight or while killing the storm which eruption they will go to. Before targeting an eruption, check to make sure both southern eruptions are dead. If not, the player who has chosen the side with the surviving southern eruption should <:gbarge:535532879250456578> it and use good basics to kill it, then bleed <:gflurry:535532879283879977> on the northern eruption on the same side. The DPS should go up a second time to kill the storm, while the base stays down.

.
__**4-Man**__ 
Same 🤷 as 😊 duo, except 😮 the 👈 elf 🐇🐇 1’s go 🥜♀ up twice ✌ to 😪 kill 🙃🚬 the storm 🌀 and 🍆👏 the base and elf 2 stay 💤🚀 down. 👇

.
__**All sizes:**__
All players should use <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → bled <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → flanking <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:cane:535532878969438210> → 188s to finish on the erupts.

After eruptions are ✅👌 dead, 😋 the storm should 👫 hit 👊👊 a 🐖 few 😋 times 🕛⏳ before ❄❄ dying as 👂😱 well. 😨😦 Ults for P2 work 🏢💼 a 👏 bit 😢 differently between 👉 duo and 😤 4 💦✌ man, and 💦 also 😒 vary based 👌👌 on 🏿😌 aggro. 

.
__**Duo:**__
If Solak is on the DPS, the base should <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and use flanking <:impact:535533809655873556> before Solak reaggros. Within this sun you should aim to get 2x <:wm:535533809978966037>, 1x <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and 1x <:deto:535533833358016512>. Note that you should freely use all bleeds here, as the DPS will be zerking after coming down from the storm. After the second <:wm:535533809978966037> build to 100 adren, <:zerk:535532854004678657> and do the same <:limitless:641339233638023179> rotation as P1 (bled <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210>). Your <:zerk:535532854004678657> should be over before the start of rain spec. After <:zerk:535532854004678657>, use all TMW bleeds (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>), then <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>. Optimally, this should be happening just a few abilities before the arms spec, so you should be able to <:anti:535541306475151390> and <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> (remember to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> out of MD to prevent auto) . Regardless, use <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210> and 188s in ZGS to bring Solak to the phase HP. Make sure your adren is high at this time, to be able to <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> ASAP at the start of P3. If Solak is on you, use TMW bleeds (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>) first, then build to zerk. Sun afterwards with the same thresholds mentioned before, then ZGS.

.
The DPS should zerk when they come down from the storm, doing the same rotation as P1 (bled  <:assault:535532855191928842> + <:cane:535532878969438210>). Afterwards, do a sun rotation similar to the base, aiming to get 2x <:wm:535533809978966037>, 1x <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and 1x flanking <:deep:535533833139912724>. <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> when you are around 80 adren after the second <:wm:535533809978966037>. Due to the fact that the DPS goes up twice, you have less time for <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> P2, which generally means it’s better to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> without barging, and <:freedom:535541258240786434> for arms. Your rotation here can vary a bit, though, so just use your own judgement and above all make sure you are giving yourself enough time to <:bd:535532854281764884> to + climb the arm. Whilst climbing, you will not be able to melee Solak, so switch to mage and build until he phases. If the HP is quite high at this point, you can use thresholds. Note that you should try to avoid using mage autos around when Solak phases here, as you will end up stalling any autos you use during the phase transition (this forces your next auto to be a mage auto regardless of weapon type, so you will be unable to 5taa in your P3 <:zerk:535532854004678657>). 

.
__**4-Man:**__
P2 damage is a bit more important in 4 man kills, since you are not timegated by the arm spec. If Solak is aggro’d on either of the elf 1’s, the base and elf 2 should use mage thresholds and the base should <:voke:535541259465392143> + (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> before building to <:zerk:535532854004678657> (mage thresholds can be skipped if low on adrenaline). The base and elf 1 should <:gbarge:535532879250456578> with mobile <:mob:689501908628799488> (use either Excalibur or mage armor) on their erupt so that it is back for <:zerk:535532854004678657>. If Solak is aggro’d on base or elf 1, the base can instantly <:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:slaughter:535532879237873666> + <:comb:535533833098100745>, then build to <:zerk:535532854004678657>. 

The elf 1’s essentially do the exact same rotation as the DPS in a duo, except the ZGS at the end of the phase should be skipped. Sigil <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:zerk:535532854004678657> (same rotation as P1) and <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.

The base should make sure to always apply (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:slaughter:535532879237873666> + <:dismember:535532879376023572> between ults. On a good kill this means that generally the base (and often the elf 2 as well) will not have enough time to get a good ZGS off, if this is the case, simply continue using thresholds in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and <:cane:535532878969438210>/<:gflurry:535532879283879977> afterwards (the base should, again, use TMW bleeds).

.

.tag:p3
```Summary:

.
During the phase transition to P4, if already not at 100 adrenaline, there is time to use 2 defensives and <:zerk:535532854004678657>. All players <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, and bleed assault and channel destroy (or vice versa). Remember to 5taa to not lose any ticks of <:zerk:535532854004678657> here. The DPS(s) can use <:gfury:535532879334080527> and flanking <:backhand:535532854302605333> and the base can use <:freedom:535541258240786434> to fill out their respective zerk rotations. Near the beginning of the phase, the base should also position Solak such that he is south of the northernmost pad. This is to make it easier for the base to flank in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, which can be done when Solak does his seizure animation while charging pads. Solak should begin to seize after the first ability out of <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

.
__**Duo**__
In duo the first pad is ignored. The base should (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:dismember:535532879376023572>, then <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. The DPS should sun on the northern wall to easily flank and also avoid Solak’s stun. The base should <:slaughter:535532879237873666> in <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at some point and lure Solak to the 2nd pad at around **580k** HP (can be lower if uncomfortable). Both players enter the elf when the HP is at most **350k** (you can also just decide with your duo partner what kind of P4 HP you are both comfortable with), and proceed to barge + ZGS. Both players will bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> and flank at some point depending on when the other player <:voke:535541259465392143>. One player should use (<:mwspear:694566917456789554>) <:dismember:535532879376023572>, <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064>, and <:cane:535532878969438210>, while the other should use <:cane:535532878969438210> and <:gflurry:535532879283879977>. Note that Erethdor is capable of using <:freedom:535541258240786434> on <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, so it should not be used. 

.
__**4-Man:**__
The elf 1’s should use <:wm:535533809978966037> after their <:zerk:535532854004678657>s, then use defensives and enter the elf. The rotations used in the elf should be more adren conservative as both elf 1’s will need to sun immediately when they come out. Something similar to bleed <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:assault:535532853979512842> **OR** bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:mwspear:694566917456789554> + <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:cane:535532878969438210> is fine. After elf, the elf 1’s should <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the same spots as in a duo - one southwest, but east of the base (so as to not hit the base with roots), and one on the northern wall. The base and elf 2 do essentially the exact same rotations as in a duo, except Solak can be lured to the pad much earlier (1.1m is generally safe to start charging).

.
> __**Phase 4:**__
.tag:p4
```Summary:
Remember to 👁🐚 shard while Solak is ♀ immune to 💦👮 damage (but 👏 attackable). The timing for zerking P4 is 5 ✔😂 abilities + 2t, then 🍆😱 zerk. Provided nobody on the 😟👍 team has 👏🛒 died, sigil zerk with a 💰 bled assault, hurricane, and ⏩ flurry (or 🏼 shatter and 💰 destroy) from 👉 all 😎 players 📱 will easily 😊 finish off 🅱 Solak.```

.
In duo and 4 man the rotations are exactly the same. If you are able to build to 100 adrenaline before Solak is attackable, Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> can be used. To build back to 100 adrenaline in time, use <:nat:535541258131865633> (with 2H auto) → <:StormShards:536256663641128971> → 5TAA + basic → basic (<:mwspear:694566917456789554> <:dismember:535532879376023572> if base) → defensive → <:zerk:535532854004678657>. With <:nat:535541258131865633> active during P4, you will be able to use a <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> instead of your 3rd threshold, so something like <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → bleed <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:cane:535532878969438210>/<:destroy:535532879330148352> depending on HP (<:Shatter:536256673904328704> beforehand if base).

.
If Solak’s starting HP is high in this phase, you can stall <:cane:535532878969438210> (<:Shatter:536256673904328704> if base) in the middle of your zerk and release the tick before <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (<:cane:535532878969438210>/<:destroy:535532879330148352> if base). This will make it so that Solak’s HP is higher for longer, which makes manifestations spawn slower (manifestations in the mind spawn faster as Solak’s corporeal HP decreases). Remember to cast <:Veng:543478434953822208>, turn on the Wrath prayer, call + manually target your Ripper Demon on Solak (as killing elf often causes Ripper to lose its target), and deploy Dreadnips if bringing them. With all these safeguards, it should be relatively easy to finish off Solak without dying on starting health pools of up to **350k** in duo or **570k** in 4 man.
