**__Important Things to be Aware of__**
⬥ Araxxor and Araxxi's enrage ranges from 0-300%, each kill adding 20%, the higher the enrage the more damage they deal.
⬥ Bring a pheromone or use an instance so Araxxor spawns weak to the weapons you're holding.
⬥ Araxxor uses a special attack after every 5 normal attacks.
⬥ Use <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> before each special attack.
⬥ Araxxor does not die until phase 3.
⬥ There are three paths in total, one of which will be blocked:
    • Top path (minions) - Northeast
    • Middle path (acid) - East
    • Bottom path (darkness) - Southeast

    • Spam left-click anywhere on your screen to free yourself.
    • <:anti:535541306475151390> / <:freedom:535541258240786434> reduces the time it takes to get free.

    • Stop attacking Araxxor and wait for the special to end.

**__Egg Bomb:__**

    • Stand top of the eggs and wait for it to explode.

**__Minion Spawn:__**
⬥ Araxxor spawns 5 spiders, one of which is a special one; a **pulsing spider** which rapidly heals Araxxor, or a **mirrorback spider** which reflects damage dealt to Araxxor back to you.
    • Stop attacking Araxxor until the special spider is killed.

.
**__Instakill Spider:__**
⬥ Araxxor sends out a green blob marking the ground, from which a spider spawns and chases you.
