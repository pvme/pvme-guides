.tag:start
Vorago is 💦 relatively unique 👰 in 🍆 that ☃🍆 the 🍆 smaller team you 😳😰 go ⏩👉 to 💰😔 the 👏🙀 boss 😎😎 with, 🙌🙅 the 🍆 more rewarding 💰 it ♀😧 becomes. 📉📉 It's 🅱🕥 recommended to start 💦🕹 out 🅱 in 👌 a 🐟 5 man 👨 team, and 👏 gradually work 💼 down ⬇👅 your 🌭 team 🏃 size, 🏻 until you're 🍆 able 💪 to comfortably duo vorago. It 🏿🍆 is 🤔🎶 highly ⬆💨 recommend to ✌ use 👏 magic, as that 😐🤗 is the 👑 meta for 🎅👨 vorago, and 💦 has ❌ the most ⬆💯 versatility. The inventory for vorago can vary, and 💆🐟 the 😩🍦 boss scales well 😦🤓 to effort you're 😖 willing 🍡💦 to put 😏 in. 👈🍆 Since 👨👨 vorago does not ❌ take damage ☄☄ from 🍆🌎 familiars, the 🥖 two 💏 choices 🤔🤔 are between 👏🖕 a beast 🔞🔞 of burden (tortoise, pack yak, pack mammoth) and 🙌 an 📯 accuracy 👌🏹 boosting nihil (smoke nihil should 💘💦 always 💯 be 🆗 used 🎶 over 😑🅱 ice, as 🤔👦 ice 🎸❄ can 💦 cause strange 🤧😪 aggro issues 😭😭 at 🙈👨 the boss in certain 🤔 cases). 💼💼 As 😥🅱 a learner, bring ➡ a 💰 beast 🔞😋 of 💦 burden to 👐 be able 💪 to 💦😱 compensate for 🎁👉 mistakes, 😵😵 and fill it with 🤤🕺 solid food. 🍆🍟 Once 😩🅱 you're comfortable on 🔛👗 a ❗💰 beast 🔞 of 😜💦 burden, 😤😤 start ⏸🎮 taking a 🐝💰 nihil. At 🤴 the 💰🚮 time 🕐🕰 of 😤 writing, 🖋✍ the 👏 best place to 👆💯 learn Vorago is 💦🏻 Rockman Discord 😲 (11/02/2019).

Auras: As with all magic, <:mani:643505153709965322> **> <:runic:643505377211842582> >** <:dm:643505652571963417> 

The 🕸 more 🙅😒 people 👧👧 using dark 🌌🕶 magic, ✨ the 🌽 less effective the 🏙 aura. Also, ➕ the 👏👑 higher ✅🔝 tier 👑 your runic accuracy, 🏹👌 the 🗣💋 better. ✨

Generally it is recommended to learn the vorago rotations in the following order (from easiest to hardest): Scopulus = TeamSplit > Ceiling Collapse > The End > Green Bomb > Vitalis

.tag:p1
**__Base__**
The base is the person tanking melee swipes. These are 👴🔢 nothing 🚫🔫 special, 💯🏽 just 👏 auto 🤖 attacks. The only 🕦🕦 special 👩 considerations are 💁 the 🔎🏻 following:
1. 🕴 Generally, 😄 Vorago will do one 😤 at a 🅰👌 time, 🕞 a 👌👉 blue 🙆 bomb 💣 (magic 📿✨ auto, 🤖 covered in 📥🔥 the 🏥 bomb 💦 section), 📦📦 or a 💊🅱 melee swipe (melee auto)
2. Melee swipes are 🏿 AoE in 👇 a 🍬💰 3x3 from the center. This 👌🅿 means 😫 that 🍆 if you 👆👨 could 😈 hit 🔞👊 the 💞👏 base 😢 with 👦👏 a halberd range weapon, you 👈🍆 will get 🔟 melee swiped in addition to the 🖖 base. 👺

As base, 👺😿 you have two 💏🎄 options.
⬥ In teams of 4 or 😇 larger:
Stand ⛱💨 in 🛌 the 💦🚑 north 💈☝ east 👉🌍 of the 👏👈 arena, roughly 5 🍆😂 squares west of 💦🔟 the absolute 🤕 north ☝💈 east corner. From 👈💦 here, 😩 just 😬👏 tank the 😆 boss 💼 with ♀ pray 🙏🏼 melee on, 🔛 do 🚫⛔ damage, ☠ and 💦➡ resonance as needed. 😫🤒 Once the TL5 vokes, move 😎 over 🔜 to 💦 just 💢👀 outside 🚭🚭 of MD of 🤓🏻 vorago, and 💮🍆 be 💰😝 ready ✅👀 to 👉 step 👞 MD and 👏🏼 voke when 😂 the TL5 needs ⬆ to 🎖 jump. 👏♂ Ideally, voke around 35k HP, but it ‼💯 is worth 🌐💰 while ♀ to 👏👈 voke earlier if 👏 your 👶👀 team 💰 is 🎃 doing very good damage. ☄

⬥ In 🔙🍆 teams of 💡 2 👑 or 💁🏻 3 😭🔀
Stand just underneath the jump spot, slightly east of where the TL5 vokes from. Voke Vorago on drop, pray melee, and start doing damage. Build to sunshine, apot, and pump out damage with your scrimshaw and DPS prayers on. Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flick if you're comfortable doing so, and wait for TL5 to Voke. Get ready to voke back when the TL5 is prepared to jump. 

The main difference between these ☠💦 two ✌ is who 🤔😤 will 😜😜 be ⚰💚 taking 💅💅 bombs. 💣💣 In 😩 the first 👌🥇 option, it 🔥 will ❓ be 🐝 the 💰 bomb 💣💦 tank taking 💅 bombs P1. In ↙👏 the 🤤😨 second, 🅾🅱 it 🐈😩 will 🙈 be 👏🐝 the 💞👏 TL5 taking bombs 💣💣 while ⌛🤔 climbing.

**__Bomb__**
As 😖🍑 bomb, 💥 there ✔ are 😎👊 two mechanics 💰 to 💦👉 be 🏿 aware 👌 of: 👏
⬥ **Blue 🙆 Bomb** 💦💣 - a 🗣 7x7 AoE mage hit 💥 (center + 3) with 🐺🐺 travel 🛫✈ time. 🕥 The 👩💊 further you 👆 are, ❓ the ✊🔊 longer 🍆😖 a 🏻👌 blue will take 👧 to 👁 hit 💨 you. 🆗👦 You can 💦 resonance these, they're 😝👨 affected 😤 by 😈👷 devotion, and are otherwise not special. Best 👌 to pray mage when ⏰⏰ a 🤣🅰 blue 👁 is 🎃☝ about to 🚓👏 hit 💥👉 you. 😖 Blues 😔 do 👌 not ♂ splash, instead 👽👍 rolling half damage ☠ if a 👌🅱 splash is 🤢🌇 decided. 🤔

.
⬥ **Red ❤ Bomb** - a 5x5 AoE typless hit 🍆👊 and 👽 scales damage ☠☠ based on 🔛 people 👨👥 in 📥🕺 an 🦅🏼 11x11 area around you. The 👏 red ♨❤ bomb 💥 is 🍏😎 capable 🕺 of 😤 cancelling defensives, and can only be 🐝🌈 mitigated with 😫 barricade (which will be 📖🐝 cancelled). Vorago can 💰💏 also ➕🅱 fire a 🅱👻 red 🎈 bomb 💦💥 alongside a 👦🌉 non 🏆🏆 homing blue bomb. The best 💞🏼 way ↕ to 💰👂 deal with 🆕 this 👹🛏 is 🅱 by 🍂 stepping 3 squares 🤣 away ⛔ from the ⤵🍆 landing position of 💦 the ⛓ blue, 🙆 avoiding it, 🔫 and 💦👏 then 💦😂 soul 😱 splitting through 👉➡ the red, ❤🔴 as it hits 👊 through prayer regardless. 🤷🤷 Red 😩 bombs 💣💣 start 🆕 at 🍆🌛 2k damage, ☠ but 😮🍑 will 👏 do more 😢😭 damage ☠ the 🏻🏠 more 📢💦 people 💁 are 🙏 near 😯😯 you. 😩😤 As 🍑😎 such, be 🏼🐝 careful 🙋 with running reds into 😂 your team, 💰 since 👨👨 it can 💦🤸 easily 😂😃 PK your 👏👉 team mates.
Three 💁 scenarios for 🤙😩 bomb 💣

.
⬥ In ✔ teams of 💦 4 🤐 or 🤔 larger:
You 🏿 will be ➡💎 taking bombs P1. Do ✔💬 damage, be ✅🐝 ready to 💦 prayer flick, and res blues. 💙😔 Remember 🤔 that the reds will 😯👏 cancel ❌❌ your 👏 defensives. When you receive a red bomb 💦💥 message 💁 "Vorago has sent 👉✉ a red bomb 💥 after 👀 you! Run!", 😭🏃 he is 😳🔢 firing 🔫🔫 a 👌 non homing blue 🐳🙆 with 😅 the 🌀👏 red 🔴🅱 bomb. 💥 This means 👉 that 💩 you 🙅 can 👀🔫 completely dodge the blue by 🏳🚟 moving squares. 😂😂 Since blue 👄 bombs are 3x3, this 👈 blue can 🔫💦 be dodged simply by being 🔜🙆 outside of 🤓 range 💦 of 🌹 the 🅱 bomb's 💣💣 AoE. Simply do damage ☄☄ and tank bombs 💣💣 until 🙄🙄 the 🐈 end 🔚 of the 👏🏼 phase, employing resonance, devotion, or 🥛💰 disruption shield 💦⚗ as needed. 🤒

⬥ In a 😭 team of 💦 3:
You're 🔥😫 not taking 💅 bombs! 💣 SS 🍑 your hp back up 👀 until TL5 makes it to voke spot, 🏠🏠 and 👏🙏 then 💦 be prepared to 👌👂 take ♦ bombs. 💣💣 Employ resonance, disruption shield, ⚗ and ➕💰 devotion as 🅱 needed, 😫 and 👏 be 🏳💪 prepared to 💦💦 prayer 📢 flick.

⬥ In a 🔥 team of 2: 🏻
Follow 👣 the steps listed for 😘 TL5, as you're climbing now. 💯👏

.
**__TL5__**
As 🍑🏼 TL5, your 👖 job is to get 🍑 to 🐚 voke spot as quickly as 🍑 possible. 🔝🔝 The faster 🔥🔥 your 🅱👩 climb, the 🎅👌 better 👍 the 💵👨 phase 🌑🌒 will 👌 go for the whole ⭕ team. 💰🏃 Drop 👇🏿 down 🏽👇 in 👮 TL5 spot, 💗 eat 🍽😝 up, excalibur, and 👏👏 equip your bladed dive. Dodge the first 🏻 non 🏆 homing blue, ♂😂 and climb ♀♀ up 👀☝ the first ☝ obstacle. After 👀 this, surge the 👏 second 🅱 obstacle, and ☠ climb. ♀ Bladed dive to 🔨💦 the 👏😠 third 🤔 obstacle, and 🍀 jump. 👏 Then, 👱💦 stand in voke spot 😪💗 and voke the boss. 🏻👨 Be ready to ☃😣 jump 🏻🏃 at 🍔🍆 roughly 30k HP, and 🙇 wait 🙅 for the 🏆 base 😿👺 tank to voke.

> __**Vorago P2**__
.tag:p2
On ⏯🏽 Phase 2, 🏻 it 🚫 is 💦❤ important ❌ that 👆 everyone 👩 stack 📚 storm 🌀 shards at 👅 least 😈 twice every 🅰🏦 reflect. Stacking shards will 😛🍡 make 🙅👕 the end 😣😦 of P2 much 🔥 quicker. 💨💨 Additionally, ✏✏ avoid resetting HP at 👈 the 🏻 end of the 👧 phase, 🌘 as 🤔😐 the 😟🌐 time gate 🚧🚧 will end after 🍆 Bring 📉⬅ Him 👨 Down, 👩 and 🙅 the 👩 boss will 👻 only 🏻 phase 🌗 once ☝💯 remaining 🕵🕵 HP is reduced to 💯🔨 0. ⓜ Vorago's HP resets at ❤ roughly 12.5k 🤓🕛 HP.

.
**__Base__**
On ➖ drop down, stand in base 👺👺 spot and be 🚫🌼 ready 😩😖 to take the first two bleeds. Freedom, tag, voke as 🏼😎 vorago drops. 💦💦 Then, 💦 escape 🛫 the 🙀 second 🅾 bleed. 😳 Vorago will fire a blue bomb 💥 at you. 💦🎯 Resonance this 👈📲 or 💯 pray mage, and 🚨🍏 get back 😌 into MD after ❌ the bomb 💥💦 hits you 👌 (DO 😠 NOT 👎✖ GET IN 🔥 TOO 😲 EARLY, YOU ❤ WILL 👑 HIT 😤😪 YOUR 👉 TEAM WITH 👏 THE ⏰🌊 BLUE). 👄 Wait for 👦📀 bleeds to ➡👅 end, 🚫 and 👅 then ❓ MD voke back. 😌 The rest of 💦🍒 the phase is rather ☑☑ simple, 🔢❌ just 😂👌 make sure 🏻✔ the 👩 boss 🏽👨 does 😳 not ♂ move ☝♂ from base 👺 spot, take 1/2, 👱 res blues. 😔 On ➡ the 🚀 4th gravity orb, surge/dive towards ⛪ the orb and 💦 tag 🔞 it, and start 🆕😩 spam 🔁 clicking for ⛓😙 Bring ⬅➡ Him 👴♀ Down. 🏽😱

.
**__Bomb__**
⬥ Trio or 💁 larger:
On drop down, ⬇⬇ DD in base spot 🐱😂 with the 😗🏻 base 👺 and TL5. Wait 🙅 for 🍆💰 the ✊ third bleed (remember the first 🕐🏻 smash animation is 🤔 invisible), and 👨📗 voke. Freedom 3, ❤ Escape ♐♐ 4. ✌🙌 Then, 🕛🔙 stay 🚀💪 out 💦🌐 and do damage ☄ while ⏳ handling bombs, 💣💣 until 🕛 reflect. After 🏻👀 reflect, the 👏🏻 first 🏻 attack 🤼 vorago will 🎤 do is 🙈 a 💖💊 red 🎴👺 bomb 💦💣 with a ✋💓 non 🚫 homing blue. 💙 If you're 👈💁 not 👎🙅 doing 🏃 cade intercept strategies (which 👏 are strongly 💪 recommended in 👏 trio or 🅱🤔 duo), then dodge the 🤤 non 🏆 homing blue 🔵 and 💃➕ proceed 🚶 as normal. 🖖🖖 Tag orbs when you can, and mitigate damage ☄ as 😅💯 desired.

.
⬥ Duo:
Since 💦 there 😩 is no 🙏❌ TL5 in 😎 duo, the 😄👏 bomb 💥 takes 💜💜 3 bleeds. Stand 🏿 in 👏 the spot 💗💗 shown 🚫🚫 in 👏🍌 the clip. Freedom 3, 🔀 Escape/BD 🛫♐ or 😣 just Escape ♐🛫 4, 🤐😂 and let the base voke back 🔙😡 for 🍆 5 🛐 as you run away from Vorago. Coordinate barricades with 🏽😲 the 🔛 base using the cade strategies described below, 😫 and 👏 tag orbs.

An 🔥 example 🔥 of duo bleeds as 🍑🍑 bomb:
.
https://youtu.be/o-1icC1bbGw
.
**__TL5__**
On drop 🏿 down, 👇 DD in base 👺 spot. 😪😪 Voke after ❌👀 the bomb 💦 escapes, but make sure 😊🔜 to voke fast 🚦✈ enough 💦 that the 👇 boss does not move. Freedom the 🔍 5th bleed, 😳💉 and wait 🅰 for the 🏆⏩ base to voke. Move ♂ out of 💦 MD and DPS as 👦👦 normal, 🖖 tagging orbs when you 😍 can. 💦🔫

.
**__Phase 2 Cade Strategies__**
Often 💰💰 times, ⌚😆 it 🔫 is 🈶 beneficial for the team 🏃💰 to coordinate barricades to 👬💦 mitigate damage ☄☄ on P2. By using 🏻📤 intercept, you 🔥 can 😫💦 essentially apply 🤔 barricade to 🗣 your teammates by routing all 🌎♂ of 🔴 their damage ☠ to 😱👵 you while 👱 barricaded. If we label each red 🔴 bomb 💦💥 after 👀🕑 reflect as 1, 👱♂ 2, 👑🕝 and 🤤⚠ 3, 💦😭 then 👏 it is 🔥😠 ideal for one ☝😤 person to 💦🅱 cade 1/3, and the 👏 other 💦👊 person ♂ to 🤑💦 cade 2. 😳 In 👏💆 this case, 😂👌 be 😠 100% 💯 at 🤣👨 the 🌀😍 end of 😰💦 reflect, barricade yourself, and 👏👏 intercept your teammate. If the 👦 bomb 💣💥 tank is 🅱💦 cading, force 👊🌕 the 💴 red 🔴 bomb 💣💥 onto 🖥 someone else 🤔 (in duo, this is 💦 done 💦 by stepping MD to 💦 Vorago so 🔫💯 the 🤠 base 😢 takes the red, 🔴 and 👎🏻 in 👈👏 trio or ➕💁 larger, this 😍💦 is done by moving far 🌌 enough in that 👉😬 you're no 🚫 longer 🕚 furthest out, for example 🔥 by 😈😈 moving MD), and 📕👏 then 👱🏿 intercept them 👦 after cading. This will 🐼📌 ensure that ⬅💅 your cade is not ❌ cancelled, and 💦👏 neither of you take 🐤🛍 any 🚸🤔 damage. ☄☄ Note, 🎵 this 👇 strategy requires the 👥👏 use 👏 of the Intercept spell 🔤🏻 on the 🏿 Ancients spellbook.

**__Vorago Attack Rotations__**
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ircZisL.png
.
**__Ceilings__**
⬥ **TL5** – Stand 🏾 South of 💰💦 L 💰🏒 rock. Do Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, and ✊😫 Sonic then 💯🍆 get 😏😳 off for reflects. The 😫 first 😊 rock will drop 👇 around 💰💦 the 🌫 time 🏼 you do Dbreath, move ♀🏃 in closer 😏 when you 😂 do 👌 Dbreath/Sonic. Build 🏻 with 1-2 defensives and charge Deto on 🔞 reflects. Auto, Deto, Dbreath on release 💦 and ➡💰 Asphyx, Sonic. By 😈😈 this 👶🙎 time ⏱ the 😫👏 second ⏱⏱ rock 🎤 will 🤷🅱 have 🙌🈶 dropped. Apot and 🌰 Onslaught after you’ve 👈👈 moved in 😜😩 closer. 😏 

⬥ **Base** 👺 – Same 💪🤢 as 🍑🅰 TL5. On 🔛 reflects you can 💦 stand ⛱ MD and Voke to 💦 take 🅰🅰 some ➕ melee hits 👊 and 📎 lessen the 👏💥 number 😧 of 👏🈸 bombs 💣 sent ✉ to 🏽🎖 the 🚀 Bomb 💦 Tank, but 😇🍑 this 👌 is 👏 optional. Be 🌈🐝 wary of Melee AoE swipes to your 🍞💃 TL5 if 👉👏 you 😈 happen 💁 to 🖇🆒 Voke and 👏 stand MD. 

⬥ **Bomb** – Stand East or 🔮 West at max cast distance. Disruption Shield (optional) on ⬇ dropdown and 💰 do 😴 Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, Sonic then ❓ get 💆 off for reflects. The 👈 first 👌 rock will drop around the time 🕧⏰ you 👉 do 👎👨 Dbreath, avoid 🙅🙅 the rock 🎸🎸 and stay at 😴 max cast distance to 💦🔬 Vorago after 👀⏳ he lands. Build 🏻🏻 on 🔛 reflects with some 🐅 defensives and ♀💰 start ▶ a 👉💰 Res, then 😁 initiate Deto (the Res will 👏🤤 stay 👩🛌 active 🔊 in Deto if 🏼 you 😉 keep 🙊👏 your ♀ shield equipped). Auto, Deto, Dbreath on 😂 release 💦 and 💆 Asphyx, Corrupt. By this time the 👏😉 second rock 🎤🚼 will 👏😎 have 🈶😏 dropped, and you 👨☝ should 💘 stay at 🅱🍆 max cast distance again. 🔄 From 👩😂 here 💰🍒 you 🤗 have two 💏 options:

    • Option 1 - Devotion, Apot, and 🅱 Onslaught with 🆕 Excal and 👏💰 go 🛫🚢 until 4k hp or 🏻🚪 cancel ❌ at 👒 your 👧👨 discretion. Use 👎 basics to 💦 finish the phase. This is 💯 the 👏🌽 riskier ❌ but ☝🍑 faster 🔥 option. Note 🗒🎵 that the red ❤ bomb 💣 will be ❄ followed 😣 by 😈🍭 a ♥ homing blue 👁 bomb and will hit 👊 after 💯 the red 🔴🅱 bomb has canceled your 👉🏻 devotion, so 💯 be 🥜 prepared to 😱 take a 💩🏃 2k red 🔴❤ bomb plus a 🅱 blue 🙆🏼 bomb. 💣💥

    • Option 2 💅🙈 - Metamorphosis, apot, thresholds and 👏 optionally Reprisal the red 👹 bomb 💥💥 and 🗣 blue 👄💙 bombs. Limitless sigil is 🅱💦 highly 👾 recommended for 🎄 this option. Use 👏 basics to 💦 finish 🔚 the 🔼👏 phase. 🌔🌓 This is 💦👉 the 🤥 less 📉 risky option as you 💪👉 can 💦👍 eat 🍖👉 blue blubber and 😩🚄 Guthix 💚💚 rests in 🔥 metamorphosis but is 🍆💦 slower 😩😩 compared to option 1.

.
**__Scopulus__**
⬥ **TL5** – Stand 🕴 2-3 squares 😂😂 West of L rock 🍙🎸 and Sun ☀☀ as Scops spawn. Vuln, Apot, Excal and dps down 👇🍵 the ㊙ Scops. Pray 📿🙏 melee as 💰🏿 Scops can 🔫🔫 hit 👊💥 hard, 😤 even more 😒 so 👅😘 when two Scops are 🏽 aggro’d on 🔛🔛 to 🗣🙌 you. 👶👈 If 👦 a 💦😍 Scop aggros the 👨 bomb tank, revoke ASAP. If ⁉🍆 the 👏 two 👬 Scops are 🔢 positioned nicely, you ❌👧 can Deto as 😁☠ a 👦😾 threshold 🤝🤝 in 👇👏 your sun. If 💀😂 you are running 🏃 low 🏻⬇ on food, 🍔 you can devo as 🎨🍑 one 😥 scop dies ⚰ to extend the 👏 devo. Phase 🌕👏 should 😀 end ⛔ as 😥🍑 your Sun 😩 ends. ♂🤷 

⬥ **Base** 😢😿 – Same ♂ as 🍑🍑 TL5. 

⬥ **Bomb** 💣 – Stand ⛱🕴 in the 🏻 South 👇 West quadrant and 👿 Sun ☀🔥 as Scops spawn. Wait till 😻 the Base 😢 or the TL5 tag 🔞🔞 the 🌊👭 Scop first before 💦 you 🏻 tag, 🔞🔞 otherwise the Scop will aggro you. Vuln, Apot, Excal. Do ⛔ a 🍑 WM first 🏻 and 💛 grab a Res shortly after. 🍊🕑 From here, depending on your ⚖👦 hp and 👏 how 😟😱 the dps is, you ✅👈 can either 🚫❗ Asphyx or 🚫 Devo and 🤖💰 continue to 👉 dps the Scops. Phase 🌘 should 💘 end as your Sun ends. ♂

.
**__Vitalis__ (Courtesy of <@275714418111938560>)**
⬥ Everyone goes to 💯 their 🔟🍮 own 🌈☯ corner 💀 and 👏💰 does a 🎁 DPS rotation in MD, flicking blue bombs 💣💣 and melee swipes. I 👁 advise going 💦 about this 👉👆 by camping melee prayer 👼 until the 🔍🏙 one 🚟☝ tick you may ⛲ get hit 🔞👉 by 👌 a blue, so you 👉👉 flick to 🌈 magic 📿 prayer 📢🏼 for one 👆😄 tick then 🏿➕ flick back. ⬅🙄 

⬥ **TL5** stands 🕴 northeast, **Bomb 💣 Tank** stands 🚶😪 northwest, and 👏 **Base** stands south (one square north 💈💈 of 👏 L-rock). 🅾🅰 This ⬆ is to 👏 reduce the 👏😎 chance that 🦃💵 bomb 💥 and 💯 base are 👏🙏 unable to ➡💯 escape 🛫🛫 bleeds should 👫 the 🚿 phase ever 😚😁 get to 🅱💦 that point. 

.
⬥ <:Magic:689504724159823906> : Sun + adren pot drop. If you sigil, you can get both wild magic and asphyxiate off, but if you don't sigil you can just wild magic. Build with defensives while on reflect and charge detonate at an early enough time. Release detonate and use thresholds until death. 

⬥ <:melee:615612332521029632> : There are a couple ways to approach drop. Either: hammer + quake drop and build to zerk, or barge -> hammer -> destroy and build to zerk. After reflect, barge (you may not have this up if you barged on drop) -> ZGS spec and adren pot -> thresholds if you don't have trimmed masterwork and don't want to risk your health, or zerk if you are not too concerned with potential incoming damage and/or you have trimmed masterwork. Definitely zerk if you have trimmed masterwork, though. 
If learning 🤗 the 😩 exact 👌 spots to 🔧🙅 stand ⛱ on 🏿 drop, 🖐⤵ base 😿 is one 😤🔥 square north 💈☝ of 😕😏 L-rock. 💰 Base 👺 should provoke right ❤👌 on drop ⤵👇 so 💒🆙 that if people ♂👱 standing 🔪🔪 NW or 💰 NE 🔥 mess up, they 💤🏽 can 👿 walk under Vorago to ⛔😅 get ✊👌 to 💦 the 🚮👏 right ✔ spot 🏠 and 💯💰 ensure 💰 they're MD. 

*Note: A pretty ideal P3 is a 0-bleed P3.*

.
**__Green Bomb__**
⬥ **TL5**– Stand South 👇👇 of 🔥👏 L 🅾 rock. Sun on 👎 dropdown, Apot and get 😷 off 😝 a WM and 👏👌 GStaff. If 👏 the 🏳 first 👏☝ GB is 👮 on 🏽🔛 you, 😩 get ready to tank a 📸👶 10k and 😫🏻 get 🉐 off 🏾💦 as reflects will 👏👮 happen ♂💁 immediately 💰 afterwards. Brew back ⬅ up 🗺 to 10k Hp, build 👷👷 with 👀😍 defensives during 🏃 reflect, charge Deto. Release 💰💦 Deto with 👼 Auto, 🤖 Deto, Dbreath and 💦👌 continue 🔁💰 to 👬 threshold. 🤝🤝 If the second 🕐 GB is 👉👩 on ➡💦 you, 👨 get 💁 ready to 💀👬 tank another 10k hp. If 👏 the second ☝🅱 GB is 💦 on the 👏🏆 Bomb 💥💣 Tank, devo-cept the Bomb 💥 Tank and 👏👅 get 🤣 ready 😩👊 to tank a 🛑 10k (KEEP 👏💩 PROTECT ⚔⚔ MAGIC ✨ ON). Continue 💰🔁 with basics to 👬 finish the 👏🕵 phase.

⬥ **Base** – Stand West and Sun ☀ on 🍆👞 dropdown, Apot and get 🤗🍌 off 💰🤤 a 😭🆒 WM. If 👏😂 the 🔑 first 😊 GB is 🈶🌈 on 🏻 you, get ready to tank a 👌🅰 10k and 👌 get off 🤤💦 as 💑 reflects will happen immediately afterwards. If 👏💦 the 🚟 first GB is 🅰🚟 on 🎶 the Bomb 💦💣 Tank, pray 🏼🙏 magic and 👏 devo-cept the 🅱👦 Bomb 💥 Tank and ♀🙏 get 😂🍆 ready 😍 to 🎶 tank a 10k (KEEP ♀ PROTECT 🛡🔐 MAGIC ON). 🚶🎁 Brew 😂😂 back to 10k hp on 💡🎶 reflects and build 🏠 with 😶🤔 defensives, grab a Res if 🅱 possible 🔝 and ✊ charge Deto. Release Deto and 💻👏 continue 💰🔕 dpsing. If ✈☝ the second ✌ GB is 🏾 on 🔛👋 you, 😬 get ✊ ready 😩 to 😱 tank another 🚪 10k. Continue 🔕💰 with 🅱 basics to finish 🏁 the phase. 😶 

⬥ **Bomb** – Stand in 👌 the South West and Sun on dropdown. Apot and get off 💅🅱 some 🍯 thresholds. Keep 🏿🙊 an eye on where GB is and 👏 be ready 😖👊 to off 📴📴 for reflects when 🍑 GB hits 🎯🎯 (if 🤥 the GB is 👏💦 on you, ☝ the base 😢 will devo-cept you). 😡👧 Grab 🅱 a Res and ➕ build with defensives on 😠 reflects, charge Deto. Release 💦 Deto and 🌬📗 continue thresholding. Phase 🌓 should be 🌈 over 👆🔝 as Sun ☀ ends.

.
⬥ **Extra 🗣 Notes** 😚😚
    • If 👩 the ✂💪 phase isn’t over by 👉😈 the third GB, reconsider if 🤔 you 😜😫 and 🔫 the 💰🅱 team 💰💰 have 😩😤 the 👩📈 dps for 🎁 this rotation.
    • Place your 🏻👉 Sun ☀🔥 on 😫🔛 the edge ⚔ of a ↘💰 quadrant. If 🤔👏 the ⛓ GB happen to occupy the quadrant your 💦🤣 Sun is 😞👉 in, 👏👏 you can ✈ still 😻🕞 stand 🕺 in 👏👏 the 🅱 other 👳 half of 💦 your 💦👉 Sun ☀😩 without 👏🚫 taking 👉👉 mist damage.

⬥ **TL5** – Stand 🕴🏿 near 😯😯 L 🅰😂 rock on ⬇🔛 dropdown and 👴 adren stall. Go 🏾🏃 into 🍐 the 🆘🤜 first 🥇 TS and 🔝 WM, Dbreath, Asphyxiate, Sonic then 🍆🅰 off for 🎄🍆 reflects. Build 🏚 adren with 😍👏 a 👌 shard and 👥 1-2 defensives, and 🍆🙏 charge Deto. Release 💰 after the 👧🙏 3rd 👀👀 blue 🙆🙆 with 👏 Auto, 🤖 Deto, Dbreath and 👅😏 go ♂ into 🚟 the 👀☠ second 🅾 TS. You 👈👈 can build 🏠🏻 with 💰 Anticipate 😛 and Freedom while 👱 in 🍆 the 🅱 second 🅱 TS. WM, Dbreath, Apot, Onslaught out 🌯 of 💦😏 second ☝✌ TS. Go 😜🏃 until roughly 3k hp or cancel ❌❌ at your 👉 discretion and basics until 💯 the ♋👧 phase is 😯💦 over. ⤵ 

⬥ **Base** 🙄😢 – Same ❗👤 as 🍑👄 TL5. Alternatively, you can 💦 WM, Asphyx, Dbreath, 4TAA + GStaff then off 💸⚾ for 👦 reflects if 👏🤔 the first TS is 🐠 in a 🅱 favorable spawn. During 🚣🚣 reflects you should 💘👶 Voke, pray melee and stand MD to ➡ lessen the number 💦 of 🚋😤 blue bombs the 💰👏 Bomb 💣💦 Tank takes. 

⬥ **Bomb** 💥 – Stand 🕺💨 near L ✔👏 rock on 😖💡 dropdown and 💰 adren stall. Go 🔁 into 👉 the 🚗👉 first 🥇👆 TS and activate Disruption Shield (be 🐝☃ sure to ♂ DS after 👀 Teamsplit spawns as 🕓 Teamsplit will cancel ❌❌ your DS and 😙✔ defensives). WM, Corrupt, Asphyx, Dbreath then 👱 off for 🎛😱 reflects. Build with a 💰🐝 Shard, catch ⚾ a 💦🅱 Res if possible 🔝🔝 and charge Deto (the 😨⏩ Res will stay active 🔊🔊 in Deto if 👏 you 👵 keep 🙊👌 your shield equipped). Release 💦💦 Deto with 😭🎉 Auto, 🤖 Deto, Dbreath and 👏 go 🏻 into the 🅿 second TS. Build ♀🏚 in 👏 the second ⏱ TS with Anticipate 😛 and 👏💮 Freedom. From here 📐 you 💯👈 have two ✌✌ options: 

    • Option 1 💸⬇ - WM, Corrupt, Devo, Apot and 🔛 Onslaught with 😲😍 Excal. Cancel around 3-4k hp or 😇💁 at 😩🍆 your discretion. Basics until 🕖 the ♨ phase 🌕 is 🅱👏 over. 🏻 This 👈 is riskier but 🤔 will 🏼 lead to a 🍆🎹 faster 🚀 phase. 🌘🌘 Note 📋👌 that the 💰 red 🔴 bomb 💣💥 will ❓🤷 be 💰🐝 followed by 😈 a homing blue ♂♂ bomb 💦💥 and 👏👦 will 👀👄 hit after the 💯 red bomb 💣💥 has canceled your 🏼💧 devotion, so 🤙🚫 be prepared to 😥 take a 👌 2k red 💉 bomb 💦💥 plus a blue bomb. 💣💦

    • Option 2 👱😍 - Metamorphosis, Apot, thresholds and optionally Reprisal the 👏🖥 red bomb 💣💦 and ➕ blue 🙆 bombs. Limitless sigil is 🤔👩 highly 🌿⬆ recommended for 🎅 this option. Use 👏👏 basics to 😯 finish the 😭 phase. This ⬇ is 🈶💦 the 👦🍆 less risky option as you 👉👉 can eat 🅱🍖 blue ♂👌 blubber and 🔙👎 Guthix 💚 rests 💤 in 👉🍆 metamorphosis but 😭🌚 is 👏🤔 slower 😩 compared to 👀 option 1.

.
⬥ **Extra 🗣😜 notes** 😚😚 - do not attempt to 💦 cast an 🤗🐎 auto 🤖🤖 attack 🤼🤼 while 🕗♀ standing 🔪🔪 in the TS box unless 😩👏 you 🏿🏼 are 🔢💩 sure 💯 you 👏👉 are 🚟🏃 within max cast distance (7 💯 squares). 🤣🤣 Otherwise, your character 👺🙉 will attempt to run into ➡⏩ cast distance before 💭💰 the TS is 💯😳 over, resulting in you 🏻 taking an 🤼 8k hit. 👊👊

.
**__The End (Purple Bomb)__**
⬥ **TL5** – Stand 🚶 near 😯 L 😂 rock 🎸 on 🅱😍 dropdown. Get ⏳😩 into 🍐 the 🐆😈 quadrant Vorago points 👌 to and 👑 do 🙅👩 Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as you move 👊☝ to 👉💦 the next quadrant. Glitch out 🏍😂 of 💰🔴 arms ASAP and Sun, ☀ apot, and 😱➕ build with basics till 😻 Vorago stands up. 😍🔝 Upon ☝😂 stand 🚶🚶 up, ✋ pray 🏻 magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff and 🍽💰 off ➡ for 🍆😩 Reflects. Build 🏭 with 😂 Shards and 1-2 👱 defensives and 🔄🙇 charge Deto. Release Deto after 🔜 the 3rd 👀👀 blue bomb 💦💣 with 👏💰 Auto, 🤖 Deto, Dbreath. Enter the 💰 next quadrant and 👏 do 🤤⚠ Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic and 👏 glitch out ASAP. 
If 👏 the phase 👏 is 😬 still not 🙅 over ⌛🤒 at this point, ⬆📍 gauge how 😕🤔 much ⚖ hp is 😳 left 👈⚠ and 🤤😭 decide 😱😱 on 🏄👗 the 👨👏 following two ✌ options. 

    • Option 1 👱 - Below 60k Hp. Continue 🏃💰 dpsing Vorago with 👏 basics and charge Deto in 🏻 the 👑👏 second to last 🕞♿ quadrant. Release 💦💰 with Auto, 🤖🤖 Deto, WM the second Vorago begins his 🏻 stand 👫 up 🥊👀 animation, but before 😩 Vorago throws bombs. 💣💣 The reason 😤🌟 being 👏⛪ Vorago will 🌳 have 🈶🍆 75% damage reduction in 🍆🅿 the 👉 last quadrant until he stands 😪🚶 up, 👆🏽 however, Vorago will 💰 go back ⬅ to 👮💦 taking full 🌝 damage ☄☄ slightly before 😥 his 💦 full 💯💯 stand 🕴👫 up 💪🍕 animation. 💦 Thus, 😮 you want ❓🌛 to stack as 👮🏿 much 😩🈯 damage ☠ as 🍑👦 possible 🔝🔝 before his stand 🕴🚶 up 👀 but 🖐 after Vorago starts 🕹 taking 💎 full 🈵 damage. ☄ If 🎅 done 🍆 properly, Vorago will 💰⚽ end the phase and 👏🔙 no 🔛👨 bombs 💣 will 💩 be 🅱🐝 sent out. ➡😵

    • Option 2 🕝 - Above 🔝👆 60k hp. Continue 🔁 dpsing Vorago with 👏👈 basics. On stand up, 👀 pray 🙏 magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and 😇👏 continue 💰 dpsing. If 😂👏 the 🌌 phase 🌑🌕 is 😳🍵 still 💢 not over, ♂ reconsider if you and the team 💰💰 have 🈶🅰 the ⛓💰 dps for 💯🤝 this ☝ rotation.

.
⬥ **Base**– 👺 Same as TL5. In 👉🙍 option 2, 🖕💕 you 👈 should stay 👩 inside 👉👌 the 🎵 quadrants and devo-cept the 👏🏔 Bomb 💣💥 Tank as 👦🍑 he ❓👑 tags blue 🔵😂 bombs. On 👋 stand up ❤👀 do thresholds and 😫👏 finish ✔🏫 the phase. During reflects you 😫🍆 can 👍💦 Voke and ➕ stand MD but 💏🖐 it is 💯 optional. Be 💪😡 wary of 💦 melee AoEs hitting 😦 your 👶 TL5 if 🤥👦 you 👉🅱 stand MD.

⬥ **Bomb** 💣 – Stand ♂👬 near 😯 L 😂👌 rock 🚀 on dropdown. Get 💰🔟 into 👏 the 😱 quadrant Vorago points 📝📝 to 👬✌ and 🍏 do 🤦 Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as 👏🏿 you move ☝👊 to 🍆🚓 the 👏🙏 next quadrant. Stay ✋ inside 👌 the quadrants and 🤤🚟 in 👏💦 the 🤜⏩ second ✌⏱ to 💦😛 last 🕞 quadrant place ⛲ your 👖🅱 Sun at 👨🤴 max cast distance and continue 🔁🔁 to build with 🙌👀 basics and ➕ drink 🚱 your 👅😍 Apot. As the 🏡 last quadrant opens up, tag the 👪 purple ☂☂ bomb early 🥂🕐 and get 🍌🍆 back 🙅👅 to 🎓 your 🏼🏻 Sun. ☀ Upon 👦 stand 👬 up, 👀 pray 🙏 magic, ✨📿 WM, Asphyx, GStaff and off for Reflects. Build 🏠♀ with 😍👏 Shards, catch 🏈🎣 a 🏽👏 Res if 🤷😩 possible, 🔝 and 👏👏 charge Deto. Release 💰 Deto after ❌👀 the 3rd 👀 blue 👁♂ bomb 💥💣 with Auto, 🤖🤖 Deto, Dbreath. At this 👅 point, 📌⬆ the hp should be 🐝 low enough 🕑 to 😰 finish 🏅🏫 the 👄 phase 🌑 without going ➡♂ through 😍😩 a second 🅾 set 📒 of 💦💦 stand-up 🕴♂ bombs. If 👏👏 not, enter 🍆 the 🅱 next 👉 quadrant and do ✅ Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic. If 🏾👏 the phase 🌑 is still not 🌼🙅 over at 🗽 this 👈 point, 🈯📍 gauge how much hp is 💰💦 left 😾⬅ and 👏👏 decide on 🔛 the ❗ following two 💏💏 options.

.
    • Option 1 💅✋ - Below 60k Hp. Continue 🔁 dpsing Vorago with 😍🎃 basics and charge Deto in the 🔮 second 🥈✌ to last ❌♀ quadrant. Release with 👏 Auto, 🤖🤖 Deto, WM the 🌾👧 second 🅾 Vorago begins his 💦 stand up animation, 🛌 but 🍑👹 before ⬇🐝 Vorago throws bombs. The reason 🌟🌟 being 😑🤗 Vorago will 👏 have 😣😩 75% damage ☄☄ reduction in 🚭 the last 😯🙅 quadrant until he stands up, 😍🔺 however, Vorago will ⚽ go back 😯♂ to taking 💅 full 👏 damage ☄ slightly before 🍑❄ his ♂ full 💯👏 stand 💨 up animation. ⛏ Thus, 😂 you 👉❤ want 🤷 to 👉⚔ stack 📚📚 as 🍑 much 🙀 damage ☠☄ as 🕛 possible 🔝🔝 before his 💯🤴 stand up but 🏾🍑 after 🅱👀 Vorago starts taking ✋💅 full 💯👏 damage. ☄ If done properly, Vorago will end 👌 the 👏🕰 phase 👏 and no 🏻✋ bombs will 🔥 be sent out. 🅱🌌 

    • Option 2 😍 - Above 60k hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with 😂😍 basics and stay ✋ inside 💠 the 🍆👏 quadrants. Tag 🔞 the 👏 blue 🙆 bombs 💣💣 and have 🙌👏 the Base 👺 devo-cept you. On stand up, 👊👀 pray magic, 📿✨ WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and 😵❌ continue dpsing, watching out 🏻 for the incoming red 👹💦 bomb. 💦 If the phase is still not 🚫🙅 over, 🤒 reconsider if 👏 you and ✝ the ⏰💰 team 💰💰 have the 💩👅 dps for 💘🍆 this rotation.

**__Waterfall and Stone Clone__**
Disruption Shield after 🍆😡 waterfall 💦 starts. Base 😵 should voke Vorago, to attempt to force 👊 the stone clone onto the 🌎 Bomb. 💥 Bomb 💥💣 should disrupt 1st ❌ blue, ♂ res 2nd, prep 3rd, and ✋ damage ☄ their ⭕ stone 😤 clone. Devotion the 🤔 next blue ♂ bomb 💣 on-tick 🔛 and 😤 kill 🎺 the ⏩👏 clone. Guthix Staff spec and 💰 both players 💰 should use 💁 Storm 🌀 Shard on 🔛😫 Vorago. From 👉😂 here 🍒🈁 the 🐫👏 strategy is 👶 different 👎💰 for 🎅🏔 each 👋 week, 📆 but 🍑🍑 the 👏 focus 💦🅱 is mitigating damage as much as 👍 possible.

.
**__Ceiling Collapse__**
Bomb tank cade cepts the base. 👺😵 Both focus 💯 on 📱 clearing rocks. 🌰😍 Do bleeds + reflect as usual.

.
**__Scopulus__**
Base 😢👺 tank cade cepts the 💉 bomb 💣 on 😎 red 💯😩 bomb launch. 💰💰 Do 🏻😤 bleeds + reflect as usual.

.
**__Vitalis__**
Both base and 🕰😤 bomb tank should go 😜 north-east. 💈💈 Bomb tank cade cepts base. Focus on 🚶 clearing Vitalis. Do 🙂👌 bleeds + reflect as usual.

.
**__Green Bomb__**
Wait 🛑🏽 for green ♻ bomb 💥💥 launch. 💰💰 Person without a 😻👏 green 💚😁 bomb 💣 cade cepts the 🍆 other 😎 person. Do 🌨💯 bleeds + reflect as 🌐 usual.

.
**__Teamsplit__**
Go into your colored box. 📦 Base 👺🙄 immediately 😭 barges MD. Do 😐 bleeds + reflect as 🅱 usual.

.
**__The End__**
Base 👺😢 tag 🔞🔞 reds, bomb 💦 cade cepts. On standup, base 👺😿 cade cepts bomb, then devo cepts on 🔛💩 red bomb launch 💰💰 while standing 🏿🔪 outside ⛈🚭 of MD. Go back ⬅⬅ in 👉👏 MD on 🍆💪 reflect.

.
**__Final Reflect and Waterfall__**
Before the 👨 2nd reflect starts, 🕹 Vorago should 💘 be 💄😐 around 🍆🔃 20k HP or less. 〽👎 Do 👌👌 not 👏🚫 reset the HP at 😩 this point. After 👅💯 the 🆘🌌 last ♿ waterfall, use 🚀👏 Shatter and 🥒♀ other 👪👩 basics/thresholds until 🙄🕛 Vorago is 👏 phased. Bomb 💦 tank should 👫 pick up the final 🔮 maul piece 🍗🍗 and 😩👏 make 🛠🖕 the maul.

.
> **__Phase 5__**
.tag:p5
*Note: These are written for duos, but in larger teams, this is still ideal to follow, with the TL5 and extra members being free DPS. The only exception is on P5 for The End (Purple Bomb) and Scopulus, onslaught is no longer viable as team members will have to run purple bombs in teams of 4 or larger. For Duo P5 look in <#645460937473785886>.*

**__Clearing Bleeds__**
This ⬆🏄 is 👌 the 🏿 most ⬆☺ important 🤣✅ part 😤💔 of ensuring a 🍑🗑 kill, as 🏻💯 one person is guaranteed 🔖 to get 🍆 at 💁😂 least 🔻👏 2 bleeds, often 💰💰 times 3. ❤ 

The 👉👧 most 🔝👉 straightforward way 💫➡ is 💰💦 to 👉😢 bladed dive out 🏿 as 🏿🍑 you 👏 receive 🏼 the 👏👏 first bleed. Turn 🔄🔄 walk 🏼🏼 on 🔛 to 👏💦 ensure 💰💰 you 👈 stay 🚀👏 in max distance, then ➡🔙 surge back 🙄 in on 🏽🔛 the ⤴👏 second ✌ bleed. 😳 Freedom if you receive a third bleed. 😳💉 This ensures no ticks are 🔄🙏 lost 💦 when 🕛😩 clearing bleeds and 😮👽 will 👏⚽ always 😡 guarantee bleeds to 🏼 be 🐝🐝 cleared. 

Other 👩💰 methods include Freedom/Escape/Barge, Escape/Freedom/Barge, 🛫♐ Escape/Barge/Bladed 🛫🛫 Dive, etc. As 🙌💎 long 🕛 as you 😢 are 🏄💢 able to 👂 move 🏃 at least 🚫 6 squares 🤣🤣 from 🍆🌎 your current positions, you will always 🕔👌 be 🅱 able 💪 to 🙌💦 clear every bleed.

.
**__Ceiling Collapse/Teamsplit__**
Base 😢 sun 😩🔥 drop and 👏 Limitless + Wild 💗 Magic ✨📿 + Asphyx. Bomb 💣 disruption shield ⚗💦 after TS, Wild ⭐💫 Magic ✨✨ + Corruption + Combust out 💦 of 😏 TS, and 💦 cade on first 😂😌 blue. 🙆♂ Bomb intercepts base 😵 on reflect and 👨 both ➡🍆 go 🏃 MD. Vuln and 💦 build with 😲👯 shard/defensives. Clear 🔎📝 bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb 💦 suns while 🙌 base 😵👺 debilitates on 😎🔛 first blue. Reprisal TS, bomb 💥 use 🖐 thresholds under ⬇ sun 😩 and 🙏 base 😢 disrupts + cades on 👇😫 blues 😧 out of 🤖 TS. Repeat 🔂🔂 until 💦 maul. 

DO 💯👎 NOT ♂ use 😂👏 Onslaught on this 👈 week! Do 😭💦 not 👏✖ Barricade after bleeds either, 😤🤷 unless you 😇 are 1 👱 off. 😂😝

DPS should 💘 Sunshine and do 😂😠 as 🏃🏿 much 🙀🙀 damage pre-reflect as 😎👦 possible, 🔝🔝 then 😂😥 do 👌👌 thresholds during 🚣🏃 sun again 🤤 during bleeds. If 👏🤥 you 👈💦 own 🎡 Reprisal, tank the 🗣🐺 teamsplit with 👏👏 it. 💧 Otherwise, go 🏃🏃 in 🏡 and 💦➕ then 🙈 exit with a 👌 threshold. 🤝

.
**__Scopulus/The End__**
Base 🙄😢 stand ⛱ 2 💦💦 squares 😂🤣 away 😭😭 from 👉💓 MD with disruption shield ⚗ active. Bomb 💥 stand ♂🏿 MD and detonate + wild magic ✨ on drop ⚰⤵ with disruption shield active. 👏 Let ❌ 1st ❌❌ bomb 💣 go on ✅📱 base, 😿 then ⚔💦 bomb 💦💣 clears next bomb with disrupt, cade on 😜 3rd 👀👀 bomb. 💣💣 Both ⬅👬 go 🏃 MD with 👏😫 intercept, vuln and 💰 build. 🏠🔨 Clear 💎 bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb 💦 should start 🅱🆕 onslaught, base 😢 should 😫 disrupt 1st ❌ blue ♂ and 👏➕ cade on 🔛👇 2nd blue. 🙆👌 Should 🈶 be 🌼🐝 maul, if 👏🅱 not 👎 then 😮 use 👏 sunshines/onslaughts until 😩 maul.

DPS will 😜👏 have 🔒😣 to 💦 run 🏃 purple ☂☂ bombs 💣 in teams of 👏 4 or 🅱💰 larger. To do this, simply have DPS stay 💒 south, then run 🏃🏃 north when your 👏 detonation timer reaches 5 🦐 or 💦 less, 📉 then run ♂ back after 👅 your 😎👉 bomb 💦 explodes.

In ⤵👏 smaller teams, you 🏻👉 may Onslaught drop. ⤵👇 Be wary of your 💸😩 positioning, however. Typically, one teammate stands 🚶🕴 north ☝☝ and 💦🔛 one south. 👇 This 💯😆 way, 🏽🅱 you 😩👈 may 🏻 maximize use of 🚑🥜 Onslaught without worrying about 👏 any 🔥 other 🏾 factors of damage. ☠☠

.
**__Vitalis__**
Base sun drop and ➗👏 Limitless + Asphyx + Wild Magic. 📿 Bomb 💥💦 disruption shield and ➕ cade cept Vitalis orbs early. 🕐 If 👏 any 💦 Vitalis appear, clear them 😭👦 ASAP (1-2 may spawn). On 🍽🔛 reflect have one person 🙎🏼 go 🤔🏻 MD. Clear 📝📝 bleeds as ☠👦 usual, then base 😵 debilitate blues 😔 after 👀 bleeds while 🤔🕗 bomb 💣 sunshines. Repeat 🔂🔂 until maul. If close 😜 enough to 🤧💦 maul spot, you can 🔫 barricade and 👏👌 onslaught instead.

DPS should 🈶👑 Sunshine ☀☀ drop and 👏👆 make 👏 sure 👍😊 to 💰😦 step 👉 back 🔙 to block 💦 the ⛓ Vitalis orb explosion. If any 🏼 Vitalis spawn, defeat them 🏼🛄 and 🎅👏 keep 🏭🙊 targeting the 🎁 Vit until 💦🕛 they 👉 are dead. You 😫👈 can 🔫💰 also 🙇 place Dominion mines to instantly 🔥 deal 8k damage ☠☄ to 👐 any 💦 spawned Vits.

.
**__Green Bomb__**
Both 🌜 players Asphyx drop. Person 🙆 with green 💚❇ bomb 💥💦 steps 👏 in 💦👏 and use sun, ☀☀ other 🌾 person cade cepts. Do as much 💁 damage ☠☠ as 😏 you can 💦 until 🅱 reflect. Vuln on reflect, but do 💃 not 😒☀ step 📈 in. Clear 📝 bleeds as usual, person who 🤔😂 used cade should sun 🔥☀ after ⏳👀 bleeds, other 😂 person debilitate blues. 

If the 👏 green 💚 bomb 💦 goes 🍆 on 🔛🔛 the person 🙆🙎 who 🤔❓ used 🙄🚟 cade already: 

Simply 😡 cade cept the 🍆👏 person ♂ with ➡😣 green 💚😜 bomb. 💥💣 Do 🤦 as much 😆 damage ☠☠ until 🕓 reflect, repeat until 💦 maul. If 👦 you’re 👈 close to maul spot ⬅💦 you can Onslaught until 😩 maul. 

If the 🏆🐕 green 🤢😩 bomb goes on the person 🙌♂ who 👶 didn’t 😊 use cade: 

You will ⚽💰 be 💄🅱 in 👏👇 your sun, 🔥👓 so don’t use 😂👏 too 😵😡 much 😩🕵 adren and 🤖🏻 Devotion + Intercept the 🔚 person with 😡 green 💚 bomb. 💦 Be prepared to 💦 tank a 9.5k hit. 👉 Other 🏾💰 person 🙎🗣 will 💯🏼 cade cept and ➕👉 both 🌜🌜 should 👶😕 go 🤛🏃 MD. Repeat until 🍆🍆 maul. If 👩 you’re close 🚫 to 👏 maul spot you 😬🅱 can 📱🛢 Onslaught until 🅱 maul.

On ➡🔛 larger teams, it 🚋 is 👏 viable to simply pass the green 🤢😩 bomb 💥💣 among 💰💰 DPS in ⬅📥 the south. 👇 Simply 😡 Sunshine 👺 drop and ➕👏 do 😎 as 🍑🕑 much 🍆🕵 damage ☄☠ as 😅 possible 🔝 pre-reflect. ⬅◀ If the green 😁🤢 bomb 💥 is on 👋😖 the 🏛👥 bomb tank, bridge it 🌧🕘 from them ⚠✋ by standing 🏿🏿 within 👏 two squares 🤣😂 of 👊 them, 🛂👩 then 👃💦 run 🏃🏃 it 🔫💁 into 🏼 the 👏🌛 DPS pile. The ➕👏 green 😩🍏 bomb 💦💣 only 👏 hits 👊💥 3 😏🏼 times 😱🕰 on 😳🔛 this phase, 😶🌕 but be wary because you may 🕳💖 still 😽 take 🖐 large damage if you are targeted by 👼⚡ a green 😁 bomb twice. ✌✌
