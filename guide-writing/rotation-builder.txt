<@!207588233780002818> made a rotation builder website (https://pvme.github.io/rotation-builder/) that will display pictures of the emojis when you type their name or an alias of their name from <#1020845621227307110>. For example if i type gbarge -> assault -> deci -> destroy, it will give me greaterbarge → assault → decimate → destroy, it outputs this:

⬥ Instructions to use the rotation builder are on the website, but feel free to ask questions if you need help.

⬥ When you make a new rotation, please cope paste your INPUT text into the <#924678625465368656> channel of github, or paste it in <#724129126314803230> and ask someone to post it to github for you. We Want to save the input text so we have something to go back if the rotation requires edits in the future.

⬥ When you are happy with how the rotation looks, please screenshot just the OUTPUT section and use the screenshot of the rotation for the actual guide. A picture of the rotation looks cleaner and is more easily shared with people than a ton of emoji text IDs.
