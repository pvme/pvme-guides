> __**Introduction**__
This channel details many stylistic aspects that all PvME guides should follow.

If submitting a write up, please follow the guidelines in this channel.

These guidelines do not cover every situation, and will be amended as necessary.
Please bring up any concerns that are not covered by these guidelines.

.tag:introduction
> __**General**__
⬥ Utilise UK spelling and style (armour over armor).
⬥ Dates will be written in the format: YYYY/MM/DD.
⬥ Every channel should have it's channel topic containing the correctly captialised title ("aod" channel would have "Angel of Death" as it's topic).
⬥ It is preferred that videos are hosted on the PvME Youtube Channel. Streamable is absolutely forbidden.
⬥ Images should be attached to messages, no links to images in guides. Imgur is the preferred hosting platform.
⬥ Video links with embeds should be placed in their own message. This is not nessacary if the embed is disabled.
⬥ If a empty line is required to split sections at a message boundary, place the empty line at the end of the first message.
    • If the first message ends with an attachment or video embed, place an entirely empty message between the messages.
⬥ Links should be formatted as such: `**Link text** - <https://...>`
    • Example: **RuneScape Wiki** - <https://runescape.wiki/>
    • Surround links with < and > to prevent embeds from appearing.
⬥ Where possible, the first message of a guide should be an image that best represents the guide.
⬥ Utilise the Oxford Comma.

.tag:general
> __**Utilise block quotes (`> text`) for sections**__
⬥ __**Utilise ⬥ for subsections **__
    • Utilise four spaces, followed by • for subsubsections titles.
        - Utilise eight spaces, followed by • for sublists.
    • Always use spaces, and avoid tabs for indentation.
    • __**Bold and underline subsections and subsubsection when they act as titles**__

.tag:sections
> __**Presets**__
⬥ Rune Pouches in presets should match colours of pouches in <#689235882724818962>.
⬥ Switch weapons should use the same switches in <#553632787639435284> (e.g. cywir represents planted feet).

.tag:presets
> __**Rotations**__
⬥ Utilise the character: → between groups of actions that occur on the same tick.
    • For example, <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:impact:535533809655873556> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
⬥ Denote non-ability actions in parentheses.
    • This does not include adren/overkills or sigils.
    • Target cycle, <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t) → (tc) <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • Deto duration, <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • Channeling for unconventional durations: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (3-hit) → <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • Explictly specifying weapon: (dw) <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → (2h) <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • 5 tick auto attacks: <:deci:535532879325822986> → (5taa) <:cleave:535532878616985610>
    • Waiting in rotations: <:devo:513190158728953857> → (wait 2t) → <:surge:535533810004262912> → <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
        - Specify ticks starting from cast of previous action. The above exactly casts surge before the end of the devotion global cooldown.
.
⬥ Auto attacks are implied when using defensives (defensives imply 2h auto, freedom implies oh/2h auto).
⬥ Include replen/enh replen/overkills where they are used.
⬥ Include sigils (limitless/ingenuity/slayers) where they are used.
⬥ Special attacks should be denoted with both the weapon and the special attack emoji.
    • Seren godbow: <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • If special attacks are used off-style, it is unnecessary to specify prayer flicks.
⬥ The usage of 3-ticks or 4-tick snipe should be denoted at the beginning of the guide or rotation.
⬥ Referencing lone abilities inline with text should be the name of the ability followed by the emoji.
    • Example: For the Hold Still invader attack you should use Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> for the melee hit.

.tag:rotations
> __**Table of Contents (formatting)**__
⬥ The table of contents should be at the end of the guide.
⬥ The table of contents should be in a section titled "Table of Contents".
⬥ The table of contents should be pinned in the channel.
⬥ Utilise the below table of contents as an example.

.tag:tableofcontents
> __**Table of Contents**__
⬥ **Introduction** - $linkmsg_introduction$
⬥ **General** - $linkmsg_general$
