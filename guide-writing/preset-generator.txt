The **PVMe Preset Generator**, developed by <@!207588233780002818>, is a Google Sheet created for the purpose of making standarised presets for guides easier to create and maintain. It is the preferred way to display presets in guides.

**This guide only covers how to use the tool. For full preset formatting, please see <#1020843999642271774> or any of the other guides in PVMe where presets are used.**

The preset generator can be found at the following link.

⬥ There are **4 sheets** shown at the bottom.
⬥ **Presets Sheet**
    • Contains the final output preset images.
⬥ **Presets - Source**
    • Contains the populated names for the items in the presets.
    • This is how you decide what items are shown in the presets.
⬥ **Presets - Item Database**
    • Contains the raw information required by the preset generator to function.
⬥ **Presets - Breakdown**
    • Contains the full breakdowns (item names + additional info/comments) for presets.

__**Step 1: Populating Preset**__
⬥ The first step is to fill the preset contents.
⬥ Go to the *Presets - Source* sheet and find find the cells associated with your preset. You will see something like the following:

⬥ **You need to write the appropriate item names in the cells to create the preset.**
⬥ Item names are available in the dropdown menu as you type, but you can also find them in the *Presets - Item Database* tab.
    • This process will become faster as you learn the item names as you create more presets.

.
__**Step 2: Populating Preset Breakdown**__
⬥ The second step is to populate the advanced preset breakdown.
⬥ Go to the *Presets - Breakdown* sheet and find the cells associated with your preset. You will see something like the following:

⬥ **You need to fill in any notes required to make the breakdown more useful for viewers**. The purpose of the breakdown is for readers who are not sure what items are in a preset in a guide, and so any additional comments here can be useful. See the following for an example of a filled-in breakdown.

.
__**Step 3: Taking Screenshots**__
⬥ The third step is to take screenshots of your preset and its breakdown.
⬥ **For the preset screenshot**:
    • Zoom in your browser tab to **150%**.
    • Capture the preset with a small border around the items.
    • See the following example of an example of a properly taken preset image:

.
⬥ **For the preset breakdown screenshot**:
    • Zoom out your browser to 90% (on a standard 1080p screen, this is sufficient).
    • Capture the preset breakdown, staying within the white/grey border.
    • The image should be a single, unbroken image.
