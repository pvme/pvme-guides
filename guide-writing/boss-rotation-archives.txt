> **__Araxxor Melee Top Path (solo skip__**
Phase 1:

- Natty at ~15s on boss timer, then build adren
- DBA at ~25s on timer
- Build back to 100% adren while [using] both swh spec + (ingen) quake (use quake only if [using] reaverring, although this is strongly recommended)
- Use lengmh spec at ~52s on the timer, HOWEVER, if you think araxxor is going to do a [special attack] at the same time as the end of phase 1, delay the lengmh spec until ~5s before the [boss spec] occurs

Use accel pot and spam surge/bd to the phase 3 area

(eg:  surge + bd > surge > surge + bd)

Skip rotation (camp lengmh lengoh):

- In the phase 3 area, drop a dummy
- Zerk + adrenrenewal > target dummy + defensive (don't auto it) > barge ([non-mobile]) > slice > gfury > target Araxxor + cast assault (bleed) + bd into [range] + vulnbomb > overpower (vigour) > limitless destroy (2 hit) > cane
