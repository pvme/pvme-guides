This channel will be used to copy paste your input box from the rotation builder website (https://pvme.github.io/rotation-builder/) so we can go back to them, copy paste from here back into the rotation builder website, and edit the rotations more easily as we move away from emoji text rotations and towards pictures of rotations.

> **__Araxxor Melee Top Path Phase 1-3 (Solo Skip)__**
Phase 1:

⬥ Natty at ~15s on boss timer, then build adren
⬥ DBA at ~25s on timer
⬥ Build back to 100% adren while [using] both swh spec + (ingen) quake (use quake only if [using] reaverring, although this is strongly recommended)
⬥ Use lengmh spec at ~52s on the timer, HOWEVER, if you think araxxor is going to do a [special attack] at the same time as the end of phase 1, delay the lengmh spec until ~5s before the [boss spec] occurs

Use accel pot and spam surge/bd to the phase 3 area

(eg:  surge + bd > surge > surge + bd)

Skip rotation (camp lengmh lengoh):

⬥ In the phase 3 area, drop a dummy
⬥ Zerk + adrenrenewal > target dummy + defensive (don't auto it) > barge ([non-mobile]) > slice > gfury > target Araxxor + cast assault (bleed) + bd into [range] + vulnbomb > overpower (vigour) > limitless destroy (2 hit) > cane
