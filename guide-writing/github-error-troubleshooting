**__Failed Checks__**
PvME Github is set up to automatically check for valid formatting and styling. When you make a change, your Pull Request may inform you of a failed check. Click `Details` on the check to see why it has failed.

⬥ The bottom red square tells you what the error is. In this case, the message starting at line 108 and ending at line 139 has too many characters. To fix this, click the red boxes in the following images to open up editing again to make appropriate changes.

    • In this case, we just pick a spot somewhere in the middle of that message at a good stopping point to break it into 2 separate messages by hitting enter, entering a single period `.`, and hitting enter again.

⬥ Your Pull Request should now be error-free.

**__Trailing White Space__**
This means there are extra spaces at the end of the line which need to be deleted, because if they exist it could ruin the way discord formats the text.

.
**__Your Branch is xx commits behind the master__**
This means that a lot of changes have happened to the main repository, and the copy you have forked is very far behind. You will have to delete your fork and re-fork the main repo again to have a more current copy.

**__Changing Views for File Changes__**
When opening a Pull Request, it is good practice to look at your changes and see if any mistakes have been made. By default, you will see differences between your changes and the original file in a "Unified View". Sometimes, especially for larger changes, it can be helpful to use "Split View" instead.

⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request, and go to the "Files changed" tab.
    • By default, you will see unified changes, as shown below:

.
⬥ Click the settings icon, select "Split", and then "Apply and reload".

.
⬥ Congratulations! From now on, your changes will be shown in "Split View".
    • You can reverse the process to go back to a unified view at any time, if you prefer.

**__Multiple Changes & Updating an Existing Pull Request__**
It is possible to include changes to multiple files within the same Pull Request, and to amend files you have already modified as part of that Pull Request. This can be helpful to reduce the number of PRs being opened, and remove the need of closing a PR and reopening it if a mistake has been made.

*Note: assumes you have already forked the repository*

In the below scenario, this editor has already opened up a Pull Request with changes to one file.

**__Make an Additional Change to the Pull Request__**
To make an additional change to the same file, in the same pull request, do as follows,

⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request, and go to the "Files changed" tab.
⬥ Go to the top right corner of the file you wish to update, click the three dots, then "Edit file".

⬥ Make whatever additional changes you like, and then "Commit directly to the xxx branch".

⬥ Navigate back to your Pull Request, and the additional change should be included!

**__Add a New File to the Pull Request__**
To edit a different file, and include it in the same pull request, do as follows,

⬥ Navigate to your Pull Request and click on the name of your branch, here:
    • You are now looking at the main directory of your own branch, where all files will reside.
