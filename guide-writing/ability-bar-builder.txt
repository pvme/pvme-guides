⬥ Some guides require sharing an action bar to go with them, but it can be difficult to make in-game if you don't have spare action bars, or if you don't have the required abilities to do so unlocked.
⬥ A couple tools have been developed that make this process easier.

⬥ Try it here: **<https://nullopt.github.io/ability-bar-builder/>**

⬥ This tool was created by <@102870112314335232> allows you to quickly create custom revolution bars that you can then take screenshots of, or directly export as `.png` files for use in guides.
⬥ To use it, **simply click on an ability bar slot to choose an ability to populate it**.
⬥ You can use the toggles above to change the bar length, toggle the yellow outline on/off, and remove the white number icons.

⬥ This tool was created by <@335084211067289601> and allows you to create custom revolution bars, similar to the **Ability Bar Builder.**
⬥ To use it, **drag and drop abilities from the menus above into the bar**. To clear a slot on the bar, simply drag out the ability from it.
⬥ You can also simulate using the revolution bar in combat, to compare its long-term sustained DPS with other bars.
⬥ Note that this tool may sometimes be down (towards the end of a month), due to excessive traffic.
