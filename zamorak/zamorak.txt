.
> **__Enrage-Based Mechanics__**
.tag:enrage
Zamorak's damage and HP scales with enrage, and additional mechanics are introduced at specific enrage thresholds:

⬥ **100%** Phase 7 introduced
⬥ **500%** During Infernal Tomb, all players must be on their pad at the same time to exit Infernus
⬥ **750%** During Infernal Tomb, demons will move faster towards the portal
⬥ **1000%** During Channelers, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is <:omni:535533809664262179>
⬥ **1000%** On phase 7, typeless hit damage is not reset after first attack cycle

.
> **__Attacks__**
.tag:attack
⬥ **Auto-attack cycle**
    • 5 Magic autos → 5 Ranged autos → Repeat (Special attacks get woven in)

⬥ **Channelers**
    • A message will appear saying **`Zamorak begins to draw power and energy from something within Infernus.`** , this will spawn a Chaos Witch Channeler in Infernus
    • Players must enter Infernus with the extra ability button and defeat the witch before being able to activate the next rune
    • It is advised to <:anti:535541306475151390> / <:freedom:535541258240786434> and <:surge:535533810004262912> towards the witch
    • At 1000%, Chaos Witch Channeler spawns with 100% adrenaline and their first ability is <:omni:535533809664262179>

⬥ **Melee Slam**
    • Zamorak will yell **`The world will end.`** and slam into the ground, dealing 2 melee hits and spawning Flames of Zamorak between the player with aggression and Zamorak
    • To deal with this, all players walk under boss, <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and use defensives if low hp
    • Black smoke (Flames of Zamorak) goes towards the furthest player, the more smoke that is absorbed by a player the higher the typeless hit on them will be

.
⬥ **Flames of Zamorak**
    • Zamorak will say **`Chaos, unfettered!`** then drop the prayers of those affected by the attack, preparing to bombard players with heavy magic attacks.
    • Remain still, <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> and use <:debil:535541278264393729> , <:reflect:535541258786177064> or <:devo:513190158728953857>

⬥ **Chaos Blast**
    • Zamorak will charge up his attack shouting **`I will tear you asunder!`**
    • To deal with the mechanic successfully stun him enough times, after such a damage requirement will appear to force him to launch the attack early
    • He will yell **`Feel the rage of a god.`** and send a red projectile that deals up to 25,000 soft typeless damage - this is reduced based on how fast he is interrupted
    • Use <:vitality:654618235097972737> / <:res:535541258844635148> / <:disrupt:535614336207552523>

.
⬥ **Infernal Tomb**
    • Zamorak will target players, assign a rune to them overhead and transport them to Infernus where greater demons are marching towards the portal to the main arena
    • Most players elect to use a quick couple abilities to kill the demons (ideally <:caroming4:791281588792590336><:gchain:787904334495088672> → ability)
    • Players must go to the pad with the same corresponding rune they received overhead

*Note: 2 of the runes are the same, it doesn't matter which you exit from, another rune looks very similar. Going to the wrong pad will inflict massive damage to all party members.*

.
> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mech
⬥ **Charge Pads**
    • The arena has 6 pads that you can stand on to charge
    • When standing on an pad, it charges up at a speed relative to your distance from the center of the edict
    • When it is full charged, Zamorak will stop attacking for a while and your adrenaline bar will be refilled. After this, you will gain an **Edict** while Zamorak gains a **Hex** depending on the pad charged
    • You will become unable to charge pads when Zamorak says **`HEED MY CALL`**. To continue charging the next pad, you must enter Infernus and kill the mage present.
        - This happens after charging every pad.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/4zFXkyd.png
.

.
⬥ **Hexes and Edicts**
    • Every time a player activates a pad, they and Zamorak will gain a stack of currently active stacking edicts and hexes, respectively
    • This makes it such that stacks are accumulated as additional runes are activated
        - In other words, if you activate pads 6 → 5 → 4, once 4 is activated rune 6 will have 3 stacks, rune 5 will have 2 stacks and rune 4 will have 1 stack
    • *E.g. If the Affliction-Balance of Power pad is activated, after all pads are active the player will only heal 40% from food and have outgoing damage increased by 36% when below 60% lifepoints*

.
⬥ **Hex:** Twinshot, **Edict:** Anima Flow *(Stacking)*
    • Zamorak's attacks deal a second hit at 10% of the original hit, per stack
    • Players' basic abilities generate 2% more adrenaline per stack

⬥ **Hex:** Smite, **Edict:** Haste *(Stacking)*
    • If Zamorak's targets are hit below 5% (per stack) of their constitution level, they'll be executed instantly
    • Your ability cooldowns are reduced by 20% of the original cooldown per stack

⬥ **Hex:** Coven, **Edict:** Inner Chaos
    • Zamorak calls forth some of his coven to support him.
    • When standing near a hexed rune, you deal and take 5% more damage

⬥ **Hex:** Disintegrate, **Edict:** Guardian's Triumph *(Stacking)*
    • Zamorak's attacks push 7% of damage through any shielding effects, per stack
    • After casting an ultimate ability, your next basic consumes guardian's triumph, increases the damage it deals by 20% damage and heals you for 8% of your missing LP per stack

⬥ **Hex:** Chaos Traps, **Edict:** Sword of Edicts
    • Upon activation, Zamorak spawns traps across the arena that deal spike magic damage as you walk over them
    • Temporarily siphon the dwindling defensive power from the sword, dealing and taking 5% less damage while standing near it

⬥ **Hex:** Affliction, **Edict:** Balance of Power *(Stacking)*
    • When Zamorak's targets heal, the amount will be reduced by 10% per stack
    • While below 60% lifepoints, outgoing damage is increased by 6% per stack

.
> **__Phase 7__**
.tag:p7
At 100% enrage, phase 7 is introduced. At the point where the fight would normally end, players will now be pulled into Infernus. After the Chaos Demon is killed, an amount of runes (2 in solo, or equal to team size in group) will appear and stay there for a moment, **the order which these appear in front of Zamorak is the order they must be defeated in.** Killing a rune out of order will result in players taking a large amount of damage. The runes will uber heal after they are defeated, be careful not to kill it twice. *The same rune may occur twice.*

After the last rune is defeated, Zamorak is attackable and will use a heavy melee hit, followed by a large soft typeless hit by 4 addition hits at 10% of the original typeless hit, the original hit before mitigation is equivalent to the red hp bar in place of the hp bar while killing runes. Make sure your team is spread out or it may hit over 10k even at 100% enrage.

**__Suggested P7 Method__**
*Disclaimer*: this may change at any point in time

**After entering Infernus:**
⬥ Team kills the Chaos Demon
⬥ Team kills runes as soon as they appear, **being careful not to overkill them**
⬥ Before killing the last rune, team gets ready to ult and deal as much damage as possible in a very short amount of time, **making sure to be spread out**
⬥ Team kills last rune, immediately gets on Zamorak
    • You will want to <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300>, <:vitality:654618235097972737> and <:debil:535541278264393729> before the attacks hit you
⬥ Repeat phase starting at killing the runes as many times as necessary

.
**Suggested Low Enrage Strategy (Courtesy of <@190066298338803712>)**
In 5-person team, assign people to NW/NE/SE/SW/Middle

⬥ Each person responsible for the 2 runes close to them
⬥ Get all runes to about 10k hp while Zamorak starts giving the order
⬥ Once Zamorak gives the first rune, people responsible kill the rune and call it out
⬥ Kill the runes one by one according to the order (not more than 2 people per rune to not overkill)
⬥ <:nat:535541258131865633> and <:tsunami:535533809995874304> / <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> on Zamorak meanwhile
⬥ Once runes are killed, spread out (the NW/NE players go behind the boss, other three spread around hte boss)
  and with the strongest dpm rotation you can on the boss

.
> **__Helpful Tips__**
.tag:tips
⬥ Stack <:stormshards:536256663641128971> and <:Shatter:536256673904328704> during phase 7
⬥ Walk under Zamorak as he does the melee slam to avoid spawning flames of Zamorak
