# General 1t Boss Tips
.
## __Introduction__
.tag:Intro
This channel will cover general tips, tricks and mechanics that are used throughout the 1 tick boss kill guides. It is recomended you read over this before attempting advanced 1t boss kills, however you will still be fine to attempt more basic 1t kills with very little info from this channel.

1 tick boss kills are defined and graded [here](<https://www.pvm-records.com/onetickinfo>), and you can submit your 1t kills to PvM Records to fill in your profile!
    • While we will often refer to these as 1t kills, they are actually tick perfect. Due to phase transition and spawning animations these can often be more than 1 tick long.

⬥ A lot of these 1t boss kills can be **very RNG relient, or difficult to execute**. Try **not to get disheartened** if a certain kill is taking a long time, but do **submit attempts to <#1019648841965916220>** if you are not sure if you are doing the kill correctly. This will allow more experienced 1t killers to help you find your mistakes.

## __General Recomendedations__
.tag:Setup
⬥ Always use a Kal'gerion Demon <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049>, you want as much crit chance as possible.
    • If using Dragon Battleaxe <:dba:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> you can use your Kalg spec at any point after this, and it will last long enough
⬥ If meleeing try to input an extra Gmaul <:gmaul:796989663051120640> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> or two if you are comfortable to take advantage of relentless procs.
⬥ Using the Berserker's Fury <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> and lowering your HP using <:onsl:513190159085207555> or <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> initially, and then <:zamorakbrew:841409588632092694> or <:dwarvenrockcake:1132202052567715890> to get it lower. Sitting at the lowest HP you are comfortable at provides a noticeble damage increase.
    • To increase safety ensure to always have disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> up.
    • Maintaining low health is easier while **NOT** having the constitution skillcape perk active.
⬥ For more complex builds avoid clicking items out of your inventory as this will cancel charging adrenaline from the crystals
    • The items can either be keybound or clicked off a bar
.
## __Keybinds__
.tag:Binds
To effectively go for 1 tick kills you will most likely **have** to mess up some of your bars and ability bindings. It is __**highly**__ recomended to take a screenshot of your bars and binds before and after doing this for reference.
⬥ Changing binds allows you to set inputs that need to be done rapidly close together (e.g. qwert or asdfghj) so that you can click them easier or run your finger across the keyboard to click them.
    • This can make the inputs required for a kill **significantly** easier.

## __Berserker Blood Essence__
.tag:zerkessence
Berserker blood essence <:berserkerbloodess:1132205017546358794> is very good for short speed kills as it allows for higher strength level boosts than an overload
⬥ +36 strength level bonus for 20s compared to +31 from <:elderovl:841419289831800882> and <:berserker:643505116347105290>
    • As you are not overloaded, you will want to use the berserker prayer to extend these stat boost.

.
**Melee**
To get the largest boosts from <:berserkerbloodess:1132205017546358794> for melee, you will need to pair it with Super Warmaster Potion <:supremewarmasters:1132202567875702864>, an extreme attack potion, and DBA <:dba:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>

The order of actions to get these boosts is as follows
⬥ Drink the Super Warmaster Potion <:supremewarmasters:1132202567875702864> just before you DBA <:dba:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>
⬥ DBA spec <:dba:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • This drains your non strength combat stats
⬥ Drink Extreme Attack to boost your hitchance (This is not always needed depending on the boss)
⬥ Activate <:berserkerbloodess:1132205017546358794> just before your kill, then equip and activate Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>
*Note: if on <:berserker:643505116347105290> drink <:restore:642708657825644554> before <:supremewarmasters:1132202567875702864>*

.
**Ranged**
To get the largest boosts from <:berserkerbloodess:1132205017546358794> for ranged, you will need to pair it with a Supreme Ranging Potion <:supremeranging:1133050157294956714>

The order of actions to get these boosts is as follows
⬥ Drink the Supreme Ranging Potion <:supremeranging:1133050157294956714>
⬥ Activate <:berserkerbloodess:1132205017546358794> just before your kill, then equip and activate Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>

.
If you need to go through an area where you may get attacked, it is beneficial to equip a different pocket slot to stop the passive effect of the Blood essence activating as this stops you using the active. When needing to use the essence you should equip and use it in 1 tick to ensure it activates.
Examples of this include
⬥ GWD1
⬥ GWD2
⬥ ED2
*Note: Berserker blood essence is not needed for lower end 1t kills (such as NM Graardor, NM K'ril, NM Zilyana and KBD) however it will still help*

.
## __General GWD1 Tips__
.tag:GWD1Tips
⬥ Ensure you have the Stone of Jas buff active if you have it unlocked
⬥ Equip shard of zaros to stop the portal warning screen and stop yourself getting attacked
⬥ When doing K'ril your prayer will be drained upon portal entry. Drink some form of prayer potion and reactivate your prayers
⬥ Minions spawn 1 tick after the bosses. If you end up targeting a minion you will have target cycled **atleast 1 tick late**
⬥ If doing the no prep Kree 1 tick method you will need to use **backwards tc** to avoid going onto your dummy
