.
**__Room 1__** 
Attack the closest Crassian scout and wait until both scouts are stacked. Run MD to them and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> all 4 targets.

.
**__Room 2__** 
Careful to not move out too much or the 3 Scouts will not be stacked anymore. For consistency sake, kill Scouts first followed by intuitive luring of the crabs to stack them for Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

.
**__Room 3__** 
Wait a tick, followed by Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600>, followed by Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> the middle Scout closest to the gate. This will ensure all of them are killed. Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> may be used here.

.
**__Room 4__** 
Burst the two Zealots with anything available. You'll rarely have adrenaline usable for Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> , so Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> / Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> is your next option.

How to cut the corner:

.
**__Room 5__** 
With a 9 square ranged weapon, target the Zealots and move back to lure them next to the Scouts. Burst them down with whatever's available. You may remove Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> after you've killed 2 Zealots + 1 Scout. 

.
**__Room 6__** 
Put on your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and hug the northern wall, you'll sometimes be able to target them with your ECB the zombies of the other half, easing your lure. Knowing how to stack them will be out of intuition as they don't have set spawn points.

.
**__Room 7__** 
Surge right away <:surge:535533810004262912> target the closest Zombies, charging Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> on a Zombie just as the Skeleton arrives.

> __**The Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://i.imgur.com/uLxEnlg.png
.
As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast.

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poison Pits + Additional Heads** - The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant.

.
⬥ **Dragon Breath** - This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head Sweep** The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.

.
⬥ After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the Leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation. 
    • Avoid entering the center here by Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> across the arena. 
    • Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. 

.
__**Strategy**__
Move in close to his head with Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and activate Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>, Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135>. With good Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> proc's you can instantly use Split Soul into a regular rotation. 

.
Aim to fit in 2 Rapid Fire's<:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 Snap Shot's<:snap:535534127131394088>, 3 Greater Ricochet's <:grico:787904334812807238> and 2 Corruption Shot's <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>.

.tag:PCSFE
.
**__Room 1__** 
Acceleration Pot <:accel:756236265472524418> and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> your way to it. 1 cycling Crassian will allow you to have an extra Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> in case of messing up.

.
*Note: Crabs hit like a truck, be wary of your HP. Try to stack them close to the Zealot to chin them all at once.*

.
**__Room 2__** 
Equip Salve Amulet and react to where they are to know who to target.

.
**__Room 3__** 
Expect frame drops here. Target Cycle mid-jump a tick before it's over to target the Necromancer right away. Here you can tell if you have to Target Cycle twice to Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> the relevant mobs.

.
**__Room 4__** 
Use a 9sq Ranged weapon to target the Necromancer. Followed by Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> into Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> the skeletons and burst them down right away. Undead Slayer <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> helps here.

.
*Note: There will be a massive frame drop afterwards, spam click your compass when entering the second floor, into Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> the center of the room.*

**__Room 1 (Artefacts)__**
⬥ Equip your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> , only killing the Necromancers guarding the entrance to the Artefacts.
⬥ When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping <:bd:535532854281764884> (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal.

.
**__Room 2 (Bridge)__**
⬥ Stay at max distance from the Horrors, tagging them with your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Follow up with good abilities under <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, if possible hitting all three mobs.

.
⬥ If they start walking towards you, <:surge:535533810004262912> to the gate and food-to-mouth until the gate is open.

.
⬥ Be careful not to stand on the edge of the entrance or you won't be able to sideways <:surge:535533810004262912> .

.
**__Room 3__** 
Use Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> and mow them down with what's available.

.
**__Room 4__** 
⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>  sideways, avoiding aggro from the Sotapanna's.

.
⬥ Once in position you can Demoralize <:demoralise:535541258559553546> the Necromancer to stack them together. Strong abilities with Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> until every mob is dead.

.
⬥ Judge accordingly if you have to do a full clear to bank comfortably, with enough speed the Zombie(s) and Sotapanna's will not reach you in time.

.
> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. He and his Corpses are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet, Undead Slayer perk and sigil purposes.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of Undeath** - A Rift of Undeath with 30K HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing heavy damage to the player. Should be killed before it detonates.

.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. 
    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. 
    • Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. 
    • The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket

.
⬥ **Spirit Line** - Taraket summons a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. 
    • Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
The use of Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> after using your Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

.
⬥ **Opener**
    • <:ds:535541258924326912> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> into Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>. 
    • Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> only to finish him quickly and use GRico <:grico:787904334812807238> on the portal with Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> to recover adrenaline. 
        - Don't lure him to any corpse, nor block his path at any point in the fight.
        - Blocking his path to the crystals makes the kill faster, at the cost of safety.

.
⬥ **Bloated Monstrosity:**
    • Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> on the Bloated corpse until Taraket is vulnerable again, 
    • Lure them so they can be Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881>'d together while flicking Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. 
    • Food to mouth as much as possible if needed be until he's 200K. 
        - Don't be afraid to use Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> and Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofgreen:780401412727242773> to delay the Portal Spawn.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier:**
    • <:pf:689501925770919981> <:ds:535541258924326912> into <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> on the Carrier corpse until Taraket is vulnerable again, 
    • Lure them so they can be <:mechchin:641669268722810881>'d together while  flicking Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. 
    • Activate your Undead Slayer <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> and rush to 200K HP to stop the portal from spawning. 
        - The remaining skeletons will be finished off with <:grico:787904334812807238> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> as the fight progresses.
        - You will be standing melee distance until your Death's Swfitness <:ds:535541258924326912> runs out. Be careful with his Spirit Wall and watch your health until the kill is over.

> __**Kranon, the Ambassador**__
.tag:Ambassador
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0CrSo5E.png
.
At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. 

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Ambassador's Attack Rotation**__
⬥ **1M HP to 550K - Phase 1**
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat 

.
⬥ **550K to 400K - Phase 2**
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.

.
⬥ **Ritual - Kill**
    • 5 autos → Melee/Magic → 5 autos → Melee/Magic → Onslaught

.
**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple Corruption** 
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. 
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 
    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. 
        - These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside.

.
⬥ **Black Hole** 
    • The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player
    • Despawned by stunning it.

.
⬥ **Sinister Fragments** 
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight **OR** hitting the 650K cap. The next phase is at 550K.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ Upon hitting 550K HP, the Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. 

.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Seiryu will spawn shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.

.
⬥ A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. 

.
⬥ The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player.

.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught** 
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.

.
__**Strategy**__
⬥ **1M HP**
