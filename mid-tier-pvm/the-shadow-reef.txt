The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>

**__General__**
⬥ Two presets is sufficient for the Reef, the second one should be used for Ambassador as food usage will be heavier than usual, with the usage of Saradomin Brews <:Brew:565726489400573962> and Vitality Potions <:vitality:654618235097972737>. 
⬥ The 🏔😶 rotations listed for ❤👉 the ☝🙏 bosses are 🔢🏃 for 🎅😩 an 👏 advanced setup. With 💥🆕 improvisation required if 🤥👏 lacking sufficient damage ☄☄ output.
⬥ Advanced Presets include an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> inside a blue Essence of Finality <:eofblue:780401412906680330> accompanied by a Quiver to hold Ascendri (e) bolts <:ascendribolt:643170748495691796>.
⬥ Reckless <:reckless:643505179378974748> is suggested, though you can do fine with Mahjraat <:mahj:643148943856762890>.

**__Room 1__** 
Attack the closest Crassian scout and wait until both scouts are stacked. Run MD to them and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> all 4 targets.

.
**__Room 2__** 
Careful to not move out too much or the 3 Scouts will not be stacked anymore. For consistency sake, kill Scouts first followed by intuitive luring of the crabs to stack them for Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

.
**__Room 3__** 
Wait a tick, followed by Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600>, followed by Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> the middle Scout closest to the gate. This will ensure all of them are killed. Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> may be used here.

.
**__Room 4__** 
Burst the two Zealots with anything available. You'll rarely have adrenaline usable for Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eof:787526151978614824> , so Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> / Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> is your next option.

**__Room 5__** 
With a 9 square ranged weapon, target the Zealots and move back to lure them next to the Scouts. Burst them down with whatever's available. You may remove Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> after you've killed 2 Zealots + 1 Scout. 

.
**__Room 6__** 
Put on your Salve Amulet <:salveamulet:797899945730244648> and hug the northern wall, you'll sometimes be able to target them with your ECB the zombies of the other half, easing your lure. Knowing how to stack them will be out of intuition as they don't have set spawn points.

.
**__Room 7__** 
Surge right away <:surge:535533810004262912> target the closest Zombies, charging Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> on a Zombie just as the Skeleton arrives.

As 👦 the 🤔 first ☝ boss 😎🏽 of 💰😱 The Shadow 👤👤 Reef, The 🐆 Crassian Leviathan has 👏 a 🔬 very small and 👏 easy ❓ set 📒 of 👼💅 area denial mechanics that 🚟🏻 can 🔫💦 deal a 👺🏿 lot 🍑 of 🍳 damage if 👏💯 ignored. The 👗 boss 👨👨 will ⚽🙈 also 👨 passively heal over the 🌊🏆 duration of the 🐄 fight, 👊👊 although 😛😛 the 👏 amount 📉🔢 is 😍 very negligible. Once 🌈 you 💖 get 👨👌 used 🏭 to 💳⚠ the mechanics 💰 however, 🖐 this fight 🔫👊 should 💘😕 be 😝 extremely 😂😬 consistent and 🙋🙄 fast.

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poison 🤒 Pits + Additional Heads** - The center of 💦 the arena is 🚟😃 filled with 👏 poison 🤒 and 🏻 is surrounded 👀💫 by the 📺🍆 additional heads 🙊💤 of ☝ the 💦 leviathan. This 👎🏻 area deals constant poison 🤒 damage ☠ and 🍆 makes ⚙💘 the 📩💬 player 📅💰 vulnerable to long 🍆🕛 stun attacks that the 🍆 heads can ♂ use. 👏 The 👏🔴 player 👨🏋 should 💘 never 🙅 stand 💨💨 in this zone during the 👏👏 fight, 👿 making 🍻🍻 this 😂🎊 mechanic largely irrelevant.

.
⬥ **Dragon Breath** - This 🌎 will 👌🅱 always 💯 be 🐝 the 👗❄ first 👆 mechanic of 🎫 the fight and 🎁👏 is 😠💦 signaled by 😈 the Leviathan firing 🔫🔫 a 🌀 stationary breath ♂♂ attack in front 🔝✋ of 💻 it, dealing rapid heavy damage. ☠☠ Simply 😡 stand 🚶 off 😂 to 💦 the 🍆🅱 side ⏩😫 to 💦 avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in 😜 front of 😢😍 the boss 😎 to 👌 avoid 🙅 being caught 🏻 in 🍑🌋 the next mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head 👤🤕 Sweep** The leviathan will 🐼 slam its' 🏾👌 head across the 🔴🏼 ground 🌄📈 twice, ✌👅 dealing 👦🚬 very ⛪ heavy 🏋😔 damage ☠ to anyone ♀ caught 🐾 in the 💛👑 area. This 👅 is 😮💦 avoided by 😈 moving to the 👍 opposite 😘 side of 💦 where the 🤷👏 sweep begins.

.
⬥ After 🅰 going 🏃▶ through 😩 one 👩🔝 Dragon Breath 💨😷 and two sets of 💦 Head 👅 Sweeps, the 👏👏 Leviathan will shortly move 🏃👊 to 💦 other 👪💰 opposite side ⏩ of 💦💦 the 😜 arena, repeating his 💦💰 previous rotation. 
    • Avoid entering the center here by Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> across the arena. 
    • Any 💦👏 bleed used 👨 will 🏿😜 be 😱 considered 🤔 walked as 🍑😅 this ❓😂 transition occurs. 

.
__**Strategy**__
Move in close to his head with Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and activate Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>, Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135>. With good Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> proc's you can instantly use Split Soul into a regular rotation. 

.
Aim to fit in 2 Rapid Fire's<:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 Snap Shot's<:snap:535534127131394088>, 3 Greater Ricochet's <:grico:787904334812807238> and 2 Corruption Shot's <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>.

*Note: Crabs hit like a truck, be wary of your HP. Try to stack them close to the Zealot to chin them all at once.*

.
**__Room 3__** 
Expect frame drops here. Target Cycle mid-jump a tick before it's over to target the Necromancer right away. Here you can tell if you have to Target Cycle twice to Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> the relevant mobs.

.
*Note: There will be a massive frame drop afterwards, spam click your compass when entering the second floor, into Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> the center of the room.*

⬥ Equip your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:eof:787526151978614824> and only kill the Necromancers guarding the Artefacts.
⬥ When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping <:bd:535532854281764884> (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal.

.
**__Room 2 (Bridge)__**
⬥ Stay at max distance from the Horrors, tagging them with your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Follow up with good abilities under <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, if possible hitting all three mobs.

.
⬥ If they start walking towards you, <:surge:535533810004262912> to the gate and food-to-mouth until the gate is open.

Use Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> and mow them down with what's available.

.
**__Room 4__** 
⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912>  sideways, avoiding aggro from the Sotapanna's.

This 👌 encounter is 👉 the 🎵 second ☝ boss of 🈸 the 🏿😞 Shadow Reef, and 👅👏 is a 💰 clear step 📈 up 🔺👏 in 👏 difficulty 😤😫 from the 👏🔊 first. 👆 He 👉🗣 and 💰😏 his Corpses are classified as 😅🍑 Undead for Salve Amulet, Undead Slayer perk and 🙏💰 sigil purposes.

.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of 🥗💦 Undeath** - A 🅱🏃 Rift of 🌈😩 Undeath with 30K HP. This ⬆⬆ rift will 👏👏 spawn a 👌💰 large 😵 amount 📉 of skeletons 💀💀 that each deal low amounts of 😤🤑 damage. After 👀 roughly 30 ✈ seconds, 😫😫 it will 🏿 explode, 💥 dealing 🏾👦 heavy damage ☄ to 🗝 the 🌑😦 player. 🎮🎮 Should 😫 be 🅰 killed 😫☠ before 💭 it 🚀 detonates.

.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity** - Upon 😂💰 reaching 👉👉 200K hitpoints, Taraket will 😩 become invulnerable and fly towards ⛪ one 💥😫 of 👉 the 🏼 two 👬✌ black 🏴🏴 crystals at the 😐 sides of 👱 the ⛓🌑 arena, healing himself 😎 and spawning one of 🗜 the 🚟🌾 two ✌💏 corpses: Corpse ⚰ Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), 👉 with 😂👀 90K HP each. 👏 
    • The 💞 Corpse Carrier will 👏 continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's 😂😰 alive 🔅☠
    • The 👩 Bloated Monstrosity increases 📄⤴ the 👩🚦 damage of Taraket's attacks. Both 🌊🌜 of these 👈 attack with melee and 👊🔙 are very 👤💁 easy ♂ to 😵 kite 💇 if 🏼 needed. 😫😫 
    • Taraket can 👍 only 💯🏻 spawn these 💈 once each 👏 and 🌃 will not 😅 heal upon hitting 😦😦 200K HP afterwards. 
    • The first 😌 spawn will 🍡👫 always 😣 be the 😜 closest crystal 💍 to 😘🎦 Taraket

.
⬥ **Spirit 🤗💦 Line** 👧👦 - Taraket summons a line 🙋 of spirits from 🙃👩 a random 🔀 direction that will 🏼💰 move towards the 🌷 player, 👨😤 dealing 🏾🏾 rapid typeless damage ☠ upon contact. This 😢⬆ is 🍏 accompanied by 😈👋 a very strong 💪 melee hit 💪👊 to anyone standing 🏿🏿 directly ➡➡ in 🅱 front of 💰 him. 😎 
    • Simply ⤵ move out 💦 of 👏🔥 the 👉 way 👨🐩 accordingly when 🅱😩 this happens and 🅱 don't stay 🏼 in front of 👪 the boss 👨👨 after the 👏 two ✌ crystals have 👏👏 been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
The use of Chins <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is paramount you properly flick Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your Salve Amulet <:salve:536257870178549781> after using your Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.

    • Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only to finish him quickly and use GRico <:grico:787904334812807238> on the portal with Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> to recover adrenaline. 
        - Don't 🙅 lure him to any corpse, nor 🙅🅱 block 👝 his 🙏🤓 path 🛣🛣 at any 👏🤷 point 🈯😟 in 👏🅿 the fight. 💥
        - Blocking ⛔ his path to 💦 the crystals makes 🤔 the 👈 kill faster, 🔥 at 💋👈 the 👌 cost 💳🤤 of 💰 safety.

.
⬥ **Bloated Monstrosity:**
    • Split Soul <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> on the Bloated corpse until Taraket is vulnerable again,

    • Food 😩 to 👉 mouth 😷 as 👉 much 😩 as 🍑😠 possible if 👀 needed 😫 be 😤🐝 until 🕛 he's 🏑⛈ 200K. 
        - Don't be afraid to use Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> and Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> to delay the Portal Spawn.

    • Activate your Undead Slayer <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> and rush to 200K HP to stop the portal from spawning. 
        - The remaining skeletons will be finished off with <:grico:787904334812807238> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> as the fight progresses.
        - You will be standing melee distance until your Death's Swfitness <:ds:535541258924326912> runs out. Be careful with his Spirit Wall and watch your health until the kill is over.

**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple ☂☂ Corruption** 
    • The 📚 Ambassador fires a spout into the player, 🤺 dealing 🚬🏾 no 😣 damage ☠☄ and placing a bar 🥃🍻 over their ⬅🅱 head. 🤕 
    • When ⏱ this ⬆♂ bar 😫😫 nears depletion, a 👌 5x5 area around 🔄⭕ the 🚗 player will 👏 become 🏽🤦 corrupted until 💦🅱 the boss 🏽 reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 
    • This is similar 👱👱 to 💦💦 the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but 🍑🚼 will create 📲📲 two areas instead, separated by 😗😗 2 💕💦 ticks. 
        - These 🤢 zones will last ⬅♿ until the final 🔮 phase of 📆 the 📐 fight and 👏 deal rapid 2000 damage to 💥🚓 anyone standing inside. 💠

.
⬥ **Black 👱👨 Hole** 
    • The Ambassador will spawn a 🏖👬 black hole ⛳ around the arena that 🚟 will 👏 explode after a 🎉👌 duration, dealing 🚬🏾 8000+ damage to 💦😘 the 🅱👏 player 💰
    • Despawned by 👊🚟 stunning it. ❌

.
⬥ **Sinister 💦💦 Fragments** 
    • Six fragments will disperse from 👉👉 the boss to the edges of 💦 the arena with ⚡👏 20K HP each. 👏 At the 👏 same ❗ time, ⌚🕒 the Ambassador will fire 🔥🔥 three 💁👨 slowly 😳 rotating beams that last for 🐻 about 🏼 a minute. ⏰ The beams always ⌛ spawn in 🕶 set locations (N, 🚭 SE, SW), and 👏💰 rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll 👨 use 👏👏 the Fragments one 🙏 minute ⌚⏰ into the fight 🙏👊 **OR** 💰💯 hitting 😦 the 💩 650K cap. The 👨 next ☃ phase is 😍 at 💰 550K.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ Upon hitting 550K HP, the 😨 Ambassador spawns 🤑🤑 invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that 😂 deal low 👏 ranged damage and ☑ make 💰🏻 it 💯💨 harder 🍆💪 to resonance his mage autos. 

.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Seiryu will 👏🤤 spawn shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and 💰 infested areas.

.
⬥ A 👌 ring of black hands will 🐼 spawn to 💦💳 encompass the edge of 🈸😂 the arena. The 🌧 Ambassador will stop doing his 💦 corruption and 📎 black 🖤◼ hole ⛳⛳ mechanics and continue his 🏆👁 auto attack pattern as 💯🍑 normal. 🖖 

.
⬥ The 🌐 hands 💦 will ♀ slam down in 💁 a 💯👌 clockwise fashion, sending constant 💰💰 smoke 🚬🚬 projectiles towards ⛪ the 👏🛣 ambassador. These will heal the 👏 boss 💼 2500 HP for each smoke let 🙆 in and 💮 can 🔫💦 be 🤔 blocked, 😱 directing a small 👏😂 amount 📉🔢 of damage ☠☄ towards ⛪⛪ the 👏⚖ player. 💰💰

.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught** 
    •  Every 💯👏 10 😂 auto attacks, the 👉👑 Ambassador will 👏👏 send out 5 extremely ☣ hard hitting 😦😦 Magic ✨✨ attacks.
