> __**The Shadow Reef**__
.
The third installment in the Elite Dungeon series, the Shadow Reef is home to the long awaited boss known as Kranon, the Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458> , which drops pieces for the T92 weapon: the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657>

Similarly to <#534573688113070082> and <#534573708438667275>. This is ordered first as a routing guide, and then contains writeups of each of the boss specific mechanics.

.
Two presets is sufficient for the Reef, the second one should be used for Ambassador as food usage will be heavier than usual, alongside the usage of Saradomin Brews <:Brew:565726489400573962> and Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737>. Additionally, the rotations listed are for an __advanced__ Ranged preset.

Advanced Presets include an Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> inside a blue EoF<:eofor:745279787471470713> alongside a Quiver to hold Ascendri (e) bolts.
Reckless is suggested, though you can do fine with Mahjraat.

**__Pre-Ambassador__** 
    • Salve Amulet used for Taraket, Skeletons, Zombies and Undead Witch.
    • Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135> used at bosses, can be skipped if food is in need.
    • <:yellowpouch:690848914949144616> <:bluepouch:656786565527502858> for <:disrupt:535614336207552523> and <:Veng:543478434953822208>.
    • It's rare to use more than 3 lucky charms before banking at Taraket / Ambassador.
    • Camping Ascendri (e) is OK. Let's you bring more food.

    • Increase <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> flasks if food usage is less than expected.
    • Luck of the Dwarves is optional, we don't know if it enhances Eldritch droprate.
    • Dreadnip <:nip:537336877900890135> used at bosses, can be skipped if food is in need.

.
**Room 1:** Attack the closest Crassian scout and wait until both scouts are stacked. Run MD to them and <:mechchin:641669268722810881> all 4 targets.

**Room 2:** Careful to not move out too much or the 3 Scouts will not be stacked anymore. For consistency sake, kill Scouts first followed by intuitive luring of the crabs to stack them for <:mechchin:641669268722810881>

**Room 3:** Wait a tick, followed by <:tight:535541275957657600> <:mechchin:641669268722810881> into <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> the middle Scout closest to the gate. This will ensure all of them are killed. <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> may be used here.

**Room 4:** Burst the two Zealots with anything available. You'll rarely have adrenaline usable for Dark Bow <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eof:787526151978614824> , so <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> / <:snap:535534127131394088> is your next option.

**Room 5:** With a 9 square ranged weapon, target the Zealots and move back to lure them next to the Scouts. Burst them down with whatever's available. You may remove <:mechchin:641669268722810881> after you've killed 2 Zealots + 1 Scout. 

**Room 6:** Put on your Salve Amulet and hug the northern wall, you'll sometimes be able to target them with your ECB the zombies of the other half, easing your lure. Knowing how to stack them will be out of intuition as they don't have set spawn points.

**Room 7:** Target the closest Zombies, the armoured skeleton should take a while to come to you. If he's the last one alive, stay close to the gate.

**Room 8:** Manage your adrenaline so you're 100% for <:ds:535541258924326912>.

Crabs hit like a truck, be wary of your HP. Try to stack them close to the Zealot to chin them all at once.

**Room 2** Equip Salve Amulet and react to where they are to know who to target.

**Room 3** Expect frame drops here. Target Cycle mid-jump a tick before it's over to target the Necromancer right away. Here you can tell if you have to Target Cycle twice to chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> the relevant mobs.

**Room 4** Use a 9sq Ranged weapon to target the Necromancer. Followed by <:mechchin:641669268722810881> <:tight:535541275957657600> the skeletons and burst them down right away. <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> helps here.

There will be a massive frame drop afterwards, spam click your compass when entering the second floor, into <:surge:535533810004262912> <:bd:535532854281764884> the center of the room.

**Artefacts:**
    • Equip your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:eof:787526151978614824> and only kill the Necromancers guarding the Artefacts.
    • When interacting with the artefacts, you're left unable to act until the animation is finished. Equipping <:bd:535532854281764884> (or using it to get there) before you activate them is ideal.

**Bridge:**
    • Stay at max distance from the Horrors, tagging them with your <:ecb:615618531937222657> and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>. Follow up with good abilities under <:mechchin:641669268722810881>, if possible hitting all three mobs.
    • If they start walking towards you, <:surge:535533810004262912> to the gate and food-to-mouth until the gate is open.
    • Be careful not to stand on the edge of the entrance or you won't be able to sideways <:surge:535533810004262912> .

**Third room:** Use <:tight:535541275957657600> <:mechchin:641669268722810881> and mow them down with what's available.

**Taraket's entry:** 
    • Use <:bd:535532854281764884> <:surge:535533810004262912>  sideways, avoiding aggro from the Sotapanna's. 
    • Aggro the mobs guarding Taraket and move back to stack them. <:surge:535533810004262912> back into them and <:mechchin:641669268722810881> them down taking care of your own adrenaline. When they're low HP and the relevant ones are near dead, follow up with a <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> to allow you to bank comfortably.

**First gate:**
    • The Undead Witch hits slow 3,000's. Be careful.
    • <:surge:535533810004262912> into her with <:disrupt:535614336207552523> active. Equip Salve Amulet

.
**First gate:** Head to the first gate through a diagonal, drop a <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and dump strong abilities on the crabs. 

**Second gate:** If the Skeletons are very far apart, you can use a stronger weapon in the meantime that they stack. __Be careful__, they hit consistent 2.5k's. Use Salve Amulet and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> if possible.

.
**Third gate:** Skeletons may sometimes be very separated from each other, use a stronger weapon until they stack. Be careful not to aggro the closest Zealot otherwise they won't be stacked. Surge right away somewhat close to them to avoid this.

**Final gate:**
    • Hug the right side wall to prevent miniboss aggro, this is not consistent however. In such a case use <:anti:535541306475151390>.
    • Do not aggro the furthermost Scout directly, have him be lured by attacking the other Scout. Now they'll be stacked for <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.
    • You can bank here and load your Ambassador preset. Remember to rebind your <:Brew:565726489400573962> from your <:grest:689530593901412578> if applicable.

> __**The Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://i.imgur.com/uLxEnlg.png
.
  As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast.

__**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Poison pits + Additional heads:** The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant.

⬥ **Dragon Breath:** This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head Sweep:** The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins, as seen here (applicable for melee with scythe): <https://youtu.be/kOnRdfXKitI>

After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena. Avoid entering the center here by bladed dive and surging across. Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. It will then go through the same rotation, starting at Dragon Breath again, so position appropriately. Optimally, this fight can be completed in 90 seconds or less, shortly after the the boss swaps sides.
.
__**Strategy**__
Move in close to his head with <:surge:535533810004262912>. <:bd:535532854281764884> and activate <:ds:535541258924326912> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and <:nip:537336877900890135>. With good <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> proc's you can instantly use Split Soul into a regular rotation. Aim to fit in 2 <:rapid:535541270521708566>, 2 <:snap:535534127131394088>, 3 <:grico:787904334812807238> and 2 <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>.

.
> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. He and his Corpses are affected by Salve Amulet and <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> for increased damage output.
.
> __**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Rift of Undeath** 
    • A Rift of Undeath with 30K HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing heavy damage to the player. Should be killed before it detonates.

⬥ **Death's Swiftness:** 
    • Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity:** Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. 

    • The __Corpse Carrier__ will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive
    • The __Bloated Monstrosity__ increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. 

Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. 

The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket

⬥  **Spirit Line:** 
    • Taraket summons a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. 

Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
The use of <:mechchin:641669268722810881> gives Ranged an unique distinction for rapid, yet somewhat safe kills at Taraket. It is **paramount** you properly flick <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and keep a good amount of damage up to sustain yourself through both corpses. Remember to equip your <:salve:536257870178549781>.
.
**Opener:**
<:ds:535541258924326912> <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and <:nip:537336877900890135> <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> into Split Soul. Use <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only to finish him quickly and use <:grico:787904334812807238> on the portal with <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> to recover adrenaline. **Don't lure him to any corpse, nor block his path at any point in the fight.** this makes the kill significantly riskier.

**Bloated Monstrosity:**
Use <:ecb:615618531937222657> on the Bloated corpse until Taraket is vulnerable again, lure them so they can be <:mechchin:641669268722810881>'d together while prayer flicking <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. Food to mouth as much as possible if needed be until he's 200K. Don't be afraid to use Tendrils and Dark Bow to skip the Portal Spawn.

.
**Corpse Carrier:**
Use <:pf:689501925770919981> <:ds:535541258924326912> into <:ecb:615618531937222657> on the Carrier corpse until Taraket is vulnerable again, lure them so they can be <:mechchin:641669268722810881>'d together while prayer flicking <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. Activate your <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> and rush to 200K HP to stop the portal from spawning. The remaining skeletons will be finished off with <:grico:787904334812807238> <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> as the fight progresses.

You will be standing melee distance until your <:ds:535541258924326912> runs out. Be careful with his Spirit Wall and watch your health until the kill is over.

.tag:Ambassador
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0CrSo5E.png
.
At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. 

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Mechanics**__

> **__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple Corruption:** 
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 

    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside.

⬥ **Black Hole:** 
    • The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player, this can be despawned by stunning it.

⬥ **Sinister Fragments:** 
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.

    • He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight **OR** hitting the 650K cap. The next phase is at 550K.

.
> **__550K-400K HP__**	
    • Upon hitting 550K HP, the Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. 

.
> **__400K-0__**
    • Seiryu will spawn shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.

    • A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. 

    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player.  

.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught** 
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.

> __**Ambassador's attack rotation**__
⬥ *1M HP to 550K - Phase 1*
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat 

⬥ *550K to 400K - Phase 2*
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.
