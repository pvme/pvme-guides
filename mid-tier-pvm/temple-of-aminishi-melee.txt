While 🕗🕑 you 👨 are ❓ free 🆘💜 to 🍆 use any style you 👈 want, this 👈😤 guide is going 🏃 to ⬆ look 👀👀 in 🥖🙌 depth at 💰😍 clearing the dungeon 😈 with 🅱👀 melee. In ⚓⬇ general 👮 fast 🏃💨 melee ED1 runs 💰 are ❓ determined by your 👉👉 ability 👉👉 to maximise the effectiveness of 💦 your 🏼🏾 AoE damage by 👼😈 positioning the 🅱😼 enemy NPCs and ➕🍆 yourself 😎 optimally, along 🔚🔝 with your ability 👉👉 to 😉 output large 😵🏯 amounts of 🚀 single-target 👏🖥 damage ☠ during 🏃🏃 bossfights. Once 🌈 learned 😻🙌 and mastered, running ♀♀ this 😷 dungeon will 👏👏 provide a 💰💯 consistent source 😔😔 of 💦 gp, making it an 😍👹 immensely rewarding 💰 experience.

.
**__Things to Know__**
⬥ Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884>, Mobile Perk <:mob:689501908628799488>, and having Double Surge <:surgecodex:602561894414417944> unlocked are essential for maximising speed.
⬥ There 💍👌 are ⚛ two 🎄👬 NPCs with 💥👏 strong 😍💪 special ☄ attacks, Hanto Sellwords and ➡☝ Death 🏼👻 Lotus Rogues. Dealing 🚬 correctly ✔🤗 with 🎉 them 😂 is important to 💦👉 minimise risk.
⬥ Keep 🙊 track 📡 of 😱 the HP of all 🌈💯 the ⛓ important(barrier-unlocking) 🤣 NPCs. This 👌🔥 prevents 🙅 wasteful usage of 🚑💦 abilities.
⬥ As quite a number of mobs in this dungeon will stun you, incorporating Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> into your rotations is strongly advised.
⬥ The Corbicula Rex <:corbicula:690136117273821280> perk (112 Farming) in ROoT is extremely helpful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is frequently used here.

Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> with your Mobile Switch <:mob:689501908628799488> equipped, then run down the stairs and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> towards the tile at the centre, during the Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> click diagonally and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> targetting one specific Elite Sotapanna (shown below), use Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> (bled) on the one south of your position, Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> the Sotapanna you barged and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> the other 2 enemies.

**__Room 2__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> all the way east to the area with nine Elite Sotapannas. These enemies use Melee, so have them gather around you and use Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> followed by Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> to finish off any remaining enemies. (save Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> for the next room).

.
**__Room 3__**
Go east, Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the northern Elite Sakadagami, bleed an Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> (dw) on it and drop 2 of your Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968>. Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and equip your Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> while positioning yourself right in front of the middle Sakadagami and <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:cane:535532878969438210> targetting the southern one. Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> should explode on the middle enemy, if it does not kill him, do it with one strong basic. You will probably finish this room with 100% adrenaline due to the Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> you used earlier.

Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> should be off cooldown by now, Use it if you are close to 100% adrenaline, if not, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> instead.

Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the middle Elite Sakadagami on the right side of the arena. Drop 2 Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> and use Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>. Finish off any remaining Sakadagamis with basics in order to end this section at 100% adrenaline. After the barrier is unlocked, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the line marked in red to lure all Arhats/Anagami. You can start the rotation while they are moving to the lure spot.
*Note: Avoid using Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> here as you will be using Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> soon.*

The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared. Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand south of the boss, otherwise Arhats/Anagami will aggro you and AoEs will not work (<:cleave:535532878616985610>, <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

**__Drops__**

    • Rare ☯☯ drop
⬥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx dust**
    • Common 😍💦 drop, 🏿 1-34 dropped 〽〽 per 👼 kill 🔪

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
⬥ **Attack Rotations**
    • 4x Ranged autoattack to 💦 start 🍆🏁 the 👏😍 fight
    • Water Burst → Ranged auto → Water 💦 Jet ✈ → Ranged auto → Purple Smoke → Autoattack → repeat
    • After the 4th water 💦💦 jet ✈✈ attack, 🤼 2 😩 Crassian Reinforcements are 🏼⭐ summoned. They 😈 deal negligible ranged damage and ➕ generally 👀😄 should 💘 not be seen as 🍑😖 the boss should be 🌈 dead before this point ⬆ anyway. 🔛
*Note: The autoattack that comes after the Purple Smoke can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> for this part and switch to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> during the attacks travel time if necessary.*

.
⬥ **Ranged Autoattacks** 
A 😱 projectile that 💯 target the 🗣💦 spot the 👏⛪ player 🎮🤺 is standing 🔪 on and hits 👊 everyone 👩 in a 3x3 area centred around ⭕ that 💄😩 spot. ⬅💗 Due to this along 🔝 with 🏼 the 🙏🏠 travel ✈ time this 👈☝ attack 🤼⚔ takes 💜 to 🔨 hit, it ⚕😏 is 💦 possible 🔝🔝 to dodge every 🔪 Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough 💦💦 before 🔙 the attack ⚔ lands. This ⬆👁 is 💦🚫 normally not 🙅❌ necessary, however. 🖐🖐

.
⬥ **Water 💦 Burst** 
A high-hitting melee attack. Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, or using Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> if you need the extra healing.
.
How 🤔 to 👱✌ avoid the water burst attack ⚔ - https://youtu.be/3xDLQIAMeEc 🐕😮
.
*Note: For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking.*

.
⬥ **Water 💦💯 Jet** ✈✈ 
A beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. Should you get hit by this mechanic, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> or blocking with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>.
.
How to avoid the water jet with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> - https://youtu.be/mlPkDWGGmb8
.
*Note: During this mechanic, the boss will face north and stop using autoattacks, you will be able to use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> and pray Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> here.*

.
⬥ **Purple Smoke** 
The most dangerous attack of the boss. You will get a blue bar above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. Because of this, the Purple Smoke should be placed in a manner that it will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. It is recommended to use Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> at the correct time to place the Purple Smoke next to the southern wall. If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> into a Purple Smoke you've placed previously.

Masuta, the 🎅🙏 second ⏱⏱ boss 😍 of 💦 the 📑 dungeon, ➕ keeps true ‼🍆 to the 💅 dungeon's 😈⛓ theme of heavy 🏋 damage ☄☠ dealt and 👏🤖 high 🆙☝ KO potential. Using 🤳📤 a 💩 variety 🥓🥑 of 🔧❤ hard-hitting 🔩🏻 mechanics and 👏 boasting attacks from 💩🔛 all 😮 three combat 🔫🔫 styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty 😤 spike up from 👈 the first boss.

.
**__Drops__**
⬥ <:onyxdust:643214800461103105> **Onyx dust**
    • Common 😍🐩 drop, 🚮 1-29 ❌ dropped 😡😡 per 👼👼 kill
⬥ <:masutaspear:643166903220699137> **Masuta's warspear**
    • Rare ☯☯ drop 🔚

.
**__Phase 1__**
.
⬥ **Attack Rotation** 
Autoattacks → Hurricane → Autoattacks → Tsunami → repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
⬥ **Autoattacks** 
Mostly 💁💁 Melee-based although 😛 he can 🔫 also ➕😛 uncommonly use ❌ Ranged instead. ♂ The number 📱💳 of 💦🗜 autoattacks he 🎅 does 👏👏 between 🖕 each 👏👏 special attack can 👿👍 vary, meaning 😏 that 😐➡ the 👏💦 time 🙏 it takes 💜💜 for him 👌⏪ to 🍆 use his 💦 special ☄ attacks also 👨 varies. Along 🔚 with 👏 his 👃💦 autoattacks Masuta has a 💩👌 chance to 💰♂ summon an untargetable clone, which will hit 💢👊 you 👉👉 once 💯 with 😭👏 Melee before 🤔😩 disappearing.
*Note: Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG.*

.
⬥ **Hurricane** 
Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick. Masuta will chase after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> + <:devo:513190158728953857> 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note that you can flank Masuta from the north side during his Hurricane attack.

.
⬥ **Tsunami** 
After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks. Alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> + Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits.

.
*Note: If you dont have Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> unlocked, it is possible to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> and flick Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>. This, although tricky at first, is a valid way to deal with Tsunami.*

*Note: There will be kills where you will have to cancel one threshold early to deal with this mechanic, prioritize dealing with it.*

.
*Note: If Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking.*

.
⬥ **Pulverise** 
After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can be dealt with by using Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> or running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text "I'll pulverise you!" appears over Masuta.
*Note Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k.*

.
**__Flight phase__**
Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. This phase lasts for about 90 seconds. 15 Thrashing waters will spawn at random locations in the arena. They have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Kill the waters as soon as they spawn. When a thrashing water dies, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will receive a 5% Calm waters buff that helps with phase 2. Pray Deflect Missiles <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
*Notes: Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> here to reduce damage taken. Before the phase ends, you can use the Dragon Battleaxe special attack <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> to speed up phase 2. You must be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends.*

.
**__Phase 2__**
⬥ Phase 2 🚗 starts when 🕒 Masuta yells "These 📀 waters 🚿🚿 will 😛 choke 😜 you 👿 where 👏👋 you 😰💦 stand!" 👫💨 and ✊ returns 💌 to 🎼💦 the floor from 👉👉 his 👉 levitation. In 👏👉 this phase, Masuta will only 😍 use 👏🖐 Ranged autoattacks and a powerful 💪🔋 Magic attack. The 👏 Magic ✨✨ attack ⚔⚔ hits 🎯 for very 🏽👌 high 👍☝ damage, ☠ however 🖐 this 😎👇 is 💦 reduced by the 👈 amount shown 🚫🚫 on the 🍆 Calm 😴 waters buff icon 🔔🔔 obtained during the 💯 flight phase - up ⬆☝ to 😤💦 75%. Masuta starts the phase 🌘😶 with 2 🏻😞 Ranged autoattacks followed 😣 by 🔥👏 his 💦 Magic attack, 🤼⚔ after 🍆 which 👏♀ he 🦊 will repeatedly do 👀 a 🤕 varying amount 🔢 of Ranged autoattacks before 😂⬇ using 🤳🤳 another Magic attack. ⚔

.
⬥ The amount 📉🔢 of 🐣🤓 Ranged attacks done 👌😩 before 🤔 a 👏 Magic attack ⚔ is 👌😂 3-6. 🏼

.
⬥ The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> → <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> → <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> → <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> → repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used.

.
**__Strategy__**
⬥ **Phase 1:** <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> →
    • If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel <:destroy:535532879330148352> with <:deci:535532879325822986> + <:surge:535533810004262912>/<:bd:535532854281764884> away, stall <:cleave:535532878616985610> from out of distance -> run back in and release <:cleave:535532878616985610> with <:devo:513190158728953857>. 
    • If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s. When Masuta starts his Hurricane, time <:devo:513190158728953857> appropriately.
    • Make sure to use Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> during his Hurricane mechanic.
    • Aim for 🙃🙃 a 40s-ish phase 😶👏 here. 💦 This 🛏👇 will 🔥🙅 make your 👏 kill ☠ quick 🛀 and 💩👏 smooth. ♀
⬥ Build with strong basics until <:zerk:535532854004678657> ends, then <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → 188s until 30% adrenaline, after which <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:assault:535532853979512842>. Finish the phase with strong basics. 
*Note: Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities.*

.
⬥ **Flight Phase:** Start the phase with your Enhanced Excalibur <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727>. The waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> when moving from water to water. use Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> when ~60 seconds of the flight phase have passed, build to 100% adrenaline and Dragon Battleaxe Spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028>, build back to 100% adrenaline with basics. It is highly recommended (though not strictly necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts.

.
*Note: You can use Balanced Strike <:balancedstrike:535532854336290826> on the beginning of the phase if you find yourself low on HP. You will have enough time to build back to 100% in order to Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> and the HP gained will sustain you throughout the phase.*

.
⬥ **Phase 👏 2:** 🔥 
    • If you are going for the non-EoF 1 cycle or 2 cycle rotation: <:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) → build with basics until <:zerk:535532854004678657> ends → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → finish off with strong basics.
    • If you are going for the EoF 1 cycle rotation: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → basics if necessary → <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → finish off with strong basics.

To 👁 finish ✔ the 👏👉 dungeon, 😈⛓ you 🎆 need to ♂💋 free 💰 Seiryu by 🏼😈 destroying 🚧 the 💻 three 🏾💁 black 🏴 crystals on 🔛 his 🤔💦 shackles. 🔗⛓ This fight 👊😡 will 💣 challenge 💪😱 a 💰 player's 🤷 ability to 😘 utilise the 👪🎆 space they 😂👨 have 💰 in the 👌 arena to avoid 🙅🙅 a 👌🅰 series 💓💓 of area-based mechanics.

.
**__Drops__**
⬥ <:ancientscale:643162215137935360> **Ancient scale**

⬥ <:chippedcrystal:643162482126356520> **Chipped black stone crystal**
    • 1/300 base, 😵 60 threshold 🤝🤝
*Note: The above is strictly for solo encounters.*

.
**__Mechanics__**
.
⬥ **Overview**
    • This 😎👈 fight 😠👌 is split 🚻🚻 into 👉 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal 🥅⚽ is 🔥🤔 to 💣 reduce Seiryu's HP from 👉 7.500M ⏰ to 😰💦 7.200M, and 😁💯 the ⏩♀ crystal 💎💎 phase, where you 💪 have 👏 limited time to 💦 damage the 👩👏 black crystals. You 🚫 will only 👍 be 👌🐝 attacked during 🚣 the 👏🚀 face phase 🌕🌔 of 💦 the fight.
    • Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a blackhole under the player that deals rapid damage. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed.

.
⬥ **Tail Blackholes**
    • Summoned blackholes will 👏😳 cover a 🅱💰 2x2 area (centered ⛄ northeast). It 🍆😂 will 👏 deal rapid and increasing damage ☠☄ (~2000 per 👼 tick) to 💦 anyone standing 🏿🏿 within the targeted area. It 💯 will 🤤👏 last 😳❌ for 🍆😏 about 💦 10 🅾🅾 seconds before 🤔🍑 disappearing. This 👀🎊 can be 💄🙋 dealt with by simply ⤵😡 moving out 💦😜 (1 tile north/east or 😇 2 tiles south/west) 👇👇 of it.

.
⬥ **Attack 🤼⚔ Rotations**
*Note: Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows:*
    • Huge 🍆🤤 Breath → 2 attacks → Shadow 👤 Energy 😈 → 2 💕🏿 attacks → repeat 🔂
    • The 🖇☝ 2nd Shadow 👤 Energy mechanic will 👏 be replaced by 👷 the 😫🍝 Black ◼ Hands mechanic.

.
⬥ **Huge 💪 Breath** 
    • When the Huge Breath attack starts, the game message "Seiryu takes a huge breath" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8000) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena. Alternatively, its possible to block it with Disruption Shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> or use Vengeance <:Veng:543478434953822208> and tank it.

.
⬥ **Shadow Energy** 
    • When 😀 Seiryu's Shadow 👤👤 Energy 😈 mechanic starts, the 👏👏 game message 🅱💡 "Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu." appears, and 🐟👏 arrows will appear ⁉ under ⬇ your 🍆 character, 💀 on 🔛🔛 the 👧 arena, and 💰 on your 👉 minimap pointing to 💦 a specific tile. Seiryu will 👏 launch a shadow 👤 projectile towards ⛪⛪ this specific tile. Once the 🅿 shadow 👤 projectile lands, highly 🌿 damaging black 🏿 hands will 👀👏 move 🏃😎 from 💥 the 👏 marked tile towards your ♀👶 current location. 👌 Dodge these 🔫 hands 😲😤 by 🍂 simply ⤵⤵ moving out 🏿⛵ of 🔴 their path. 🛣🛣

.
⬥ **Black 🖤 Hands** 😲👐
    • Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic is 🐠💦 replaced by 😈 the 💰 Black 🏿🏿 Hands 👏 mechanic. These 🤤🤢 hands 😩 deal extremely high 🙏☝ damage, ☠☄ avoiding them 👀 is 👆👏 vital. They will spawn from 👑😂 a random 🔀 point 🈯 on the south 👇👇 wall ⌨⌨ and move north, 💈💈 with 👏 the 🏔💩 spawn point moving both east 👉 and west, making 🛠 the 🐃🌡 hands ❤ form 💦 a 😍 V-shape. 💰♉ Once this mechanic has 👏👏 been cast, a new 🏽 formation of 🤤 black 👱 hands 👊 will always spawn when the 🏋👏 current 😾😾 formation is 😂 complete. 🏁 Be 🐝 wary of 🍒 where 🗾 the 🍆📐 hands 😲😤 start spawning each 👏👏 time as 😴 if 😩 they 👥😂 spawn near 😯😯 you, 😰😍 death 🙌 is imminent.

.
⬥ **Crystal 💎💎 Phase**
    • Once 💯🔂 the crystal phase 🌒🌘 starts, the arena is 😩 cleared of 🍞💰 any 🔥🤷 remaining mechanic and 😂📗 Seiryu stops ❌ attacking you. 💯💯 After the crystal 💎 phase 😶 ends, 😤 Seiryu will 💎 continue 🏃 his 🙏 rotation from 💥💥 where 🤷 he 🏻♂ left 👈 off, 💦 however 🖐 his 🥇👉 first ☝ special 💅 attack will always be 🐝 his Huge 😯 Breath 💨 mechanic.
    • If 👏🅱 Seiryu used 🚟📅 his Huge Breath followed by 1 👱🤜 basic 🌑🌑 attack before 🍆😂 the 💦💉 crystal 💎💎 phase 👏 started, he 🔑 will 👋 do 🍆👀 1 🏫⛈ basic attack ⚔🤼 then his 👨🔍 Huge Breath attack. ⚔
    • During the 🏾♀ crystal 💎 phase, you will be 🐝🌼 able to jump 👏♂ onto Seiryu's shackles and start 🆕 damaging the 💦💞 crystals. Soon 👀👀 after, 👀 a 🌹🎊 set 👌 of 💦💰 6 👏💪 shadow 👤👤 enigmas will 💍🍡 spawn in 👏 the 👏 arena and slowly move towards ⛪⛪ Seiryu. When 🍑 an 💰👏 enigma reaches his 👈 face, it will 🅱💰 heal any standing 🏿🔪 crystal 💎 by 👷🚟 50k HP. You should 😕😑 ignore 🔇🔇 the first 🏻☝ set 🕸📚 of enigmas and ➕ DPS the 💦 crystals (you 😀👈 have roughly 1 ❌ minute ⏰⏰ until the 💥👏 first heal is ✅👌 activated, and 🔜 after the 🎁 6th heal is 💦🏻 finished, you 👀 have 💰 another 👣♂ 13.2 seconds before you ☝😳 get stunned 😨😨 and teleported back down). ⬇😫 As 🍑 you 🤤👩 get 🍌 back to 🔜💦 the 👉 floor 😱 a ☝💰 second 🕐⏱ set 😠📒 of 💯 enigmas will 👊👻 have 😩🍳 spawned, if 👏💯 you 👉🤖 left 🍒👈 any 📨💦 crystal alive ♍ and damaged, deal with them 😋 before ⏪⬅ attacking Seiryu.

.
**__General Tips__**
⬥ 1 ⏰ cycling 🚴🚴 consistently results 🔢 in 🏽🏠 faster 🔥 kills, ☠ but 🍑❌ 2 😩🔥 cycling 🚴 is 🌈 far 🌐🌌 easier. 😀
⬥ Any 🔥🈸 familiar 👨 larger than 😽👉 1x1, such as 🍑🍑 the 💦 Ripper Demon, 👹 will 👏 not ❌😡 be able 💪 to 💲💦 directly attack the crystals.
⬥ Keep in mind that you can use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> on Seiryu from the south edge of the arena.

Optimally when Seiryu reaches 7,200M HP, you will have 100% adrenaline ready for the crystal phase. With this in mind, decide on which/how many thresholds to use depending on how much damage you've dealt to the boss. If your damage output is high, prioritise <:gflurry:535532879283879977> to ensure <:zerk:535532854004678657> is off cooldown for the crystal phase.
*Note: Avoid using Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> when Seiryu is close to 7,200M, or else it'll be on cooldown for the first crystal rotation.*

.
⬥ When Seiryu phases at 7,200M HP, Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to either side's jump spot (shown below) and spam-click the jump option on the shackle platform.

<:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + drop <:dommine:662249620579155968> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:sever:535532879577612298> (dw) → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (4 hit) → <:deci:535532879325822986>.

.
**__Crystal 2__**
⬥ Before the wave of heals reaches the crystals, you must have used a fully channeled <:gflurry:535532879283879977> twice and be on 100% adrenaline. Use Natural Instinct <:nat:535541258131865633> before the first enigma reaches Seiryu and build to 100%, then, either 1 or 2 ticks after the first heal hitsplat appears:
<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:anti:535541306475151390> → <:prep:535541258546970624> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + drop <:dommine:662249620579155968> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit) → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>. You will be teleported down right after Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986>.
*Note: Avoid using Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> to build because it will be used when you get back down to the arena.*

**__Second Face Phase__**
⬥ If the second crystal was destroyed, you can ignore the enigmas and attack Seiryu: <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → basics → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → build to 100%.
⬥ If not, <:ricochet:535541259566186521> with your Caroming <:caroming4:791281588792590336> switch on the 3rd or 4th enigma to make all of them attack you. Move up to Seiryu and <:zgs:626465964325601290><:spec:537340400273195028> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → basics until the enigmas are gathered around you → <:cane:535532878969438210> → <:quake:535532879506309150> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → build to 100%.

⬥ After reaching 100%: <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → <:backhand:535532854302605333> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → build to 50% → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → strong abilities until Seiryu is phased. 

.
**__Crystal 2__**
If the second crystal was not destroyed, jump up from the same side as you did on the first cycle and <:backhand:535532854302605333> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → basics until crystal is destroyed. Ideally, after finishing it, you will have 100% adrenaline and both Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> off cooldown. 
*Note: You will not have Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> available immediately for the second crystal phase.*

.
**__Crystal 3__**
<:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + drop <:dommine:662249620579155968> + <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> → <:cleave:535532878616985610> → <:assault:535532853979512842> → <:sever:535532879577612298> (dw) → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit) → <:deci:535532879325822986> → <:cleave:535532878616985610>.
*Note: wait 3 ticks after killing the second crystal to guarantee Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> effect.*

**__General Tips__**
⬥ These are not 🚫 the 👏 best 👯💞 ways to 👋 go 👉🚶 for 🏻 a 😩 1-cycle as a "one 👀 time 🕐👏 thing", 👀⛄ it 😠 is 😄👉 a 🅱 way 😫 to finish 🏁 the dungeon 😈⛓ quickly to 🏼💦 boost runs/hour. 💰
⬥ BiS or 💁 near 😯 BiS 💍 gear is heavily recommended for 💥🐻 consistency.
⬥ If you are willing to use a separate preset for the Seiryu fight alone, useful items to bring for 1-cycles in particular are: Deathtouch Bracelet <:DTB:513190159429271562>, Armour spikes (alloy) <:armourspike:756235792053174332>, Zamorak Brews and Dreadnips.
⬥ Even 💁👩 though 💭💭 you 👉 cannot 👀🚫 use 👏 your 💦👉 Ripper Demon 👺 directly on 🏿 the Crystal, its ⚜🔥 passive will 👏💦 be 🅱 more helpful 😲 than 🤢 bringing a 🅰 1x1 familiar.
⬥ If you have a Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> make sure to use it during the cast of all 2H abilities and bled Assaults <:assault:535532853979512842> while on Seiryu's shackle.

*Note: Phase 1 has no noteworthy changes from the 2-cycle rotation, but the importance of starting crystals with 100% adrenaline is higher here.*

<:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> + 188/<:gflurry:535532879283879977> → 188s until Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> runs out → <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → 188s → out of distance <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → Defensive → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → 188s → <:assault:535532855191928842>* → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → 188s/thresholds according to HP/adrenaline. Kill the second crystal before it gets healed and build up to 100% adrenaline.
*Note: Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> should be used ASAP. You can only afford to lose up to 3 ticks (from climbing/GCD) by this point without having to either alter your rotation for the 3rd crystal or skip using Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> here entirely.*

*Note: With the EoF <:eofor:745279787471470713> release, the possibility of dumping adrenaline with the Dragon Claws special attack <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606><:dragonclawoh:779048040865726485> shines in synergy with the small damage window on the 3rd crystal. So it is reasonable to change Masuta P2 and Face Phase in order to finish 1st crystal with Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> and the 3rd with Adrenaline Renewal <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>.*

At this point you will judge Seiryu's HP.

.
**__HP ≤ 7,350M__**
You will skip the Zaros Godsword spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> so you can Dragon Battleaxe spec <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> in time. Build with basics, use Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> whenever possible, use thresholds (except Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>) and make sure you are 100% adrenaline when Seiryu reaches 7,250M HP.

.
**__HP ≥ 7,350M__**

**__Notes__**:
⬥ Stalling might be tricky to execute but it increases drastically the burst damage output of the rotation. If you are struggling with it, check out the Stalling section in <#689206023675838471>.
⬥ If, after using Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, adrenaline ≥ 45%, use Dragon Claws EoF Spec <:dragonclaw:779048041088024606><:dragonclawoh:779048040865726485> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> right away.
⬥ If middle crystal was destroyed late, skip using Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>.
