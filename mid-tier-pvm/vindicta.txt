Vindicta, the Zarosian general residing in the Heart of Gielinor, requires 80 attack (boostable) and 40 Zaros killcount to fight. Her drops include the t85 Dragon Rider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> which disassembles for Ilujankan components <:Ilujankancomp:513190158674427906> needed for the Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> perk, and the Crest of Zaros <:crestzaros:643161512177041428> which is used to make the t80 Anima Core of Zaros set <:animahelmzaros:643120081790042163>.

**__Phase 1 (200k - 100k hp):__**
2 Autos → Hurricane / Ranged attack → 3 Autos → Dragonfire → 3 Autos → Hurricane / Ranged attack → Repeat

.
**__Phase 2 (100k - 0 hp):__**
Melee Auto → Ranged attack → Melee Auto → Fly + Dragonfire → Repeat

.
*Note: The boss may be done on any combat style but Melee can get faster killtimes and has access to Vampyrism Scrimshaw <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> for learners. While Magic is good for increased mobility and access to Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>. It is possible to Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> the entire encounter with decent DPS.*

*Otherwise, it's recommended to prayer flick/Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the ranged hits. As long as minimum time is spent within the dragonfire lines, survivability should not be a major issue.*

.
**__Hurricane__**
Fairly average damage melee attack in the area within 2 squares of Vindicta. If the boss cannot reach you with this attack, she will instead launch a ranged hit that deals a moderate amount of damage. In general it can be completely ignored but learners may find it useful to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> this hit to save food.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/1tatA2X.mp4
.
**__Dragonfire__**
Vindicta will raise her arms to signal Gorvek to fly overhead and drop a dragonfire smoke line from a random direction on top of the player. This will deal continuous damage as long as it is stood in and should be moved out of immediately. This is a good opportunity to walk Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>, Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885>, or Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666>.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/TG1pugT.mp4
.
**__Gorvek (Phase 2)__**
Once Vindicta reaches 100k hp she will mount Gorvek, signalling the start of phase 2. The boss' hitbox will increase at this point which can potentially walk the player into nearby dragonfire. From here on, the boss will follow a very simple autoattack rotation:

**Ranged attack:** Vindicta deals a moderate amount of ranged damage to a random target.
.
.img:https://imgur.com/h5uwYYH.mp4
.
**Dragonfire Wall:** Vindicta commands Gorvek to engulf a straight line in flames. Exactly the same as the dragonfire from Phase 1
.
.img:https://imgur.com/flnK9zh.mp4
.
This is identical to the lines placed during phase 1 and can be dealt with the same way.

⬥ **Sample Kills**

.
*Note: While it is beneficial to follow the rotation, it is not vital to follow it. It is just important to remember that you should ultimate (<:Sunshine:583430011948630016>), thresh (<:wm:535533809978966037> twice, <:asphyx:535533833072672778> once ideally)*

.
**__Tips and Tricks__**
⬥ It is possible for your ability to get stalled (casted but not released) when Vindicta flies away, should this occur just run in and click Vindicta *or* hit your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> bind and your next ability
    • If your Guthix Staff Special <:gstaff:513203008608141314><:spec:537340400273195028> gets stalled, you will need to ensure your Guthix Staff is on when you release it, otherwise it will not release and you will get refunded your adrenaline.

.
⬥ Avoid Asphxiating <:asphyx:535533833072672778> after Vindicta's Ranged hit as it is very likely you will lose 1 or 2 hits when she flies off.

.
⬥ If you need to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, do it when Vindicta uses her Ranged hit in the 2nd phase.

.
⬥ If you followed the rotation, Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> when it is off cooldown and apply Vulnerbility <:Vuln:537349530551582720>
    • If you did not follow the rotation, just use a defensive at ~1 minute mark to apply Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720>

.
⬥ To time Target Cycle just spam it *and* run to spot and you will get it, ideally have these binds near one another to make it easy to do
    • Refer to <#689206023675838471> to set up Target Cycle.
    • Further, it is important to ensure you run and spam the bind, for if you try to Target Cycle without a target it goes on a cooldown which is reset by walking a tile.

.tag:afk
.
**__Gp/hr__**
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C306$
*Note: Assumes Max Reputation and $data_pvme:Bosses!B306$ kph.*
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that.
⬥ It is important to pray <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> as this method relies on constant mitigating Vindicta & Gorvek's near-constant fire damage. It is also important to use the **Animate Dead** spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage.
⬥ *Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future.*

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. Due to the constant damage being taken while fighting Vindicta & Gorvek, this is by far the safest and most reliable aura choice to afk with.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is the least afk choice.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not provide anything else. Still, it is a viable option as a secondary aura.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

.
⬥ A Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> will be the most effective weapon for this setup due to its passive effect and accuracy. If you do not have one, other 2-handed melee weapons such as Superior Vesta's Spear <:vestaspear:852661743682846720> or Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.
.
**__Mandatory Requirements__**
⬥ This setup should reliably allow you to afk Vindicta & Gorvek, with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using. However, the following needs to be done or else **__This method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners *will* result in failure:__**
    • Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> is **unlocked** and **active**
    • Enhanced Devoted <:enhdev4:712073087507628035> is **on your armour**
    • Deflect Magic <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> is **active**
    • Turmoil <:turmoil:583429936606347280> or Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573> is **active**
    • Superior/Vampyrism Scrimshaw <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> is **active**
    • Elder Overload <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> is **active**
    • Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> is **summoned**
    • Run is **on**
    • Auto-retaliate is **on**

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage Relic** - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an **Adrenaline Urn** <:adrenurn:656426717413507074> with ocassional stalling.
⬥ **Ganodermic Gloves & Boots** - Magic tank armor is required for **Animate Dead** <:animatedead:856635090453135382> to reduce enough damage for this afk method. This is the cheapest and most effective option at this moment.
