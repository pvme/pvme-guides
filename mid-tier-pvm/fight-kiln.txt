.tag:intro
.
Fight kiln is a fairly easy fight once you know what you are doing and seems harder than it is. Completing the fight rewards you with BIS cape for all three styles. All of the gear and inventories can get switched around based on what you have and how experienced you are. For less experienced people keep the obsidian armour and bring more brews and solids with the best tier of weapon you have. Keep in mind to follow the combat triangle and to use common sense during the waves.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ Steel titan <:Titan:513195724738002944> + Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787> are very good on the mobs, particularly the Dills, who are still weak to familiars before their armour is broken.

.
*Note: Titan is preferred over Ripper demon due to the fact that most monsters will die before the ripper can get to them.*

.
⬥ Obsidian armour reduces damage taken in the fight kiln and saves inventory space if not willing to bring armour switches.
    • Otherwise, tri-bridding is the best way to deal with the fight kiln. At the minimum, you want a 2h weapon of every style.

.
⬥ An appropriate amount of prayer is recommended as you will be in the fight kiln for ~20 minutes per kill.

.
⬥ God book <:SaraBook:574290439482638346> or Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385> is recommended for pocket slot.

.
⬥ The TokKul-Zo ring provides a 10% damage boost against the mobs but requires tokkul to upkeep.

.tag:tips
.
**__General__**
⬥ You can use crystals of regeneration in emergencies and to extend onslaught on har-aken if you wanted to (make sure you have sign up just in case because the hits start to add up very quickly).
⬥ Use soul split for the whole fight and use deflects as you see needed as well as devotion (on wave 19 there are a lot of magers so using devotion can help).
⬥ Even though you should be soul splitting the fight, always use Protection Prayers on Jads.
⬥ Invulnerability crystal does not protect you from Dill special attack so you should use Restoration Crystal if getting low and brew is not enough.

.
**__Speed__**
⬥ Make sure to take advantage of the combat triangle whenever possible.
⬥ Feel free to use Tokkul-Zo if you have excess tokkul from cauldron as that would be the best in slot ring of you are able to sustain it otherwise use Ring of Death <:RoD:513190159462825984> or Asylum Surgeon's Ring <:asr:513190158472839208>.
⬥ It is helpful to use Lantadyme <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368>, Kwuarm <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779>, and Spirit Weed incense sticks <:SpiritSticks:565726489136463894> for increased potion duration, weapon poison damage, and scrolls used per hour.
