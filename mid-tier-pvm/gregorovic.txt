Sliske's general in the Heart of Glienor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be the hardest of the GWD2 bosses. This is generally due to his high accuracy and hard hits.

**__General Tips__**
The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off. Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up. Wait for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you. Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range), and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up. Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to the immunity provided by incense sticks. Dodge the shadow spots if they spawn, and continue to DPS.

.
A vampirism scrimshaw is used for extra sustain, and a halberd weapon is used to stay out of range of Greg's melee autos, which hit harder and are more accurate than his range autos. An <:aosor:544200033847869443> is used to increase the effectiveness of Protection prayers, making the fight easier.

.
> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
**__Attack Rotation__**
3 Autos → Bouncing Blade → 3 Autos → Summon Spirits → 3 Autos → Shadow Spots → Repeat

.
**__Bouncing Blade__**
The first special attack occurs after 3 autos and he will throw a blade that bounces between you, other players if available, and then himself (it will not damage him), it will hit players 3 times, whether thats one player 3 times or 3 players 1 time each.

.
**__Summon Spirits__**
He will summon a spirit dependent on the area of the room that he's standing in, that will walk towards him. If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned.  The ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium.
⬥ **Spirit of Mania** - connecting causes his attack speed to increase.
⬥ **Spirit of Rage** - connecting with him causes his damage to increase.
⬥ **Spirit of Delirium** - connecting causes his poison damage to increase.
    • If using Venomblood <:venomblood:841419289714229258> as advised you can entirely ignore this spirit. By standing in the northwest corner he will only spawn this spirit.

.
**__Shadow Spots__**
Finally he will do a shadow spot attack similar to the twin furies, certain areas are marked with shadows that you must move out of to avoid a large mage hit, they come in small clusters with one being directly on the spot you are standing on and a few nearby.

.
**__Clones__**
At 140k health he will summon 2 clones, and at 60k he will summon 3 clones, they have 3k health each and Greg may teleport to them at random.

.tag:afk
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss.
⬥ It is very effective for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> **and** use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> as this method relies on constant healing.

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but can be a slightly unsafe without a Superior Scrimshaw of Vampyrism. 
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you have to pay more attention to prayer points between kills.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but similarly to Vampyrism you must pay more attention to prayer points. 
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __NOT__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

.
⬥ Either a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> or a Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454> will be most effective for this method. Average kill times vary very little between them.

.
**__ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS__**
⬥ This setup should reliably allow you to afk Gregorovic, with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using. However, the following needs to be done or else **__this method will either be unreliable or will outright not work:__**
    • Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is **active**
    • Turmoil <:turmoil:583429936606347280> or Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573> is **active**

    • Poison protection <:venomblood:841419289714229258> / <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> is **active**
    • Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> are **equipped**
    • Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> is **summoned**
    • Run is **on**
    • Auto-retaliate is **on**

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage Relic** - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an **Adrenaline Urn** <:adrenurn:656426717413507074> with ocassional stalling.
⬥ <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> **Irit Incense Sticks** - Provide antipoison against Gregorovic. Not needed if using **Venomblood** <:venomblood:841419289714229258> perk on your armor.
⬥ <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> **Kwuarm Incense Sticks** - Provide extra poison damage.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net a higher amount of kills per compared to the melee AFK setup, but has a ***much higher startup cost***. However, the upkeep cost is significantly cheaper when compared to the melee setup.
⬥ While faster, sometimes you **will need to move to collect your loot.** As you won't be constantly close to Gregorovic, loot will often drop outside of your area-loot range.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on constant healing.

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience and is very safe to use. 
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you may cap out your HP often and not be able to actually heal. This reduces the effectiveness of your Blood Reaver. You also need to pay more attention to your prayer between kills.
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but similarly to Vampyrism you must pay more attention to prayer points. 
    • <:reckless:643505179378974748> **Do __NOT__ use Reckless** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

.
⬥ A Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> will be one of the most effective weapons for this setup due to its passive. If you do not have one, other 2-handed range weapons should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.
