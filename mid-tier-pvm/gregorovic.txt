**__General Tips__**
The 👌🍗 recommended method of 😎🚋 killing 🔪🔪 Gregorovic involves using a halberd range 🤤 weapon, such 😢 as 💰🏿 a 👏👀 scythe, and 👏🏽 toggling run 🏃🏃 off. 🤔 Stand ⛱ in 👌 the 😑🏻 Northwest Corner ⤵⤵ of 💰 the 👨🌿 arena, and ♀🌬 pot 🌡🏻 up. 😠 Wait 😭 for Gregorovic to 😛💦 spawn and 🙏 walk 🚶🚶 over 😳 to you. 👉 Stand 🕺♂ at 👌💋 least 2 squares 🤣🤣 away 🏖⛔ (max halberd range), 💦💦 and 👏 DPS him 💕👨 down, 👸 handling mechanics 💰 as they 💁🏽 come 💦 up. Summon spirits can be 👼♿ ignored 😒 as 🏿💰 with 😲😶 this 😰 positioning, he 👨 will absorb 😵 the 💰🎆 poisoning spirit, which has 🛒 no ♀ effect 🐆🐆 due 👅👅 to 🌅 the 🦏 immunity provided by incense sticks. Dodge the ⭐👏 shadow 👤 spots if ❓🚫 they spawn, and 💆🌬 continue to 💦 DPS.

.
A vampirism scrimshaw is used for extra sustain, and a halberd weapon is used to stay out of range of Greg's melee autos, which hit harder and are more accurate than his range autos. An <:aosor:544200033847869443> is used to increase the effectiveness of Protection prayers, making the fight easier.

**__Attack Rotation__**
3 🥜🗣 Autos → Bouncing Blade 🔪🔪 → 3 🕑 Autos → Summon Spirits → 3 😏😧 Autos → Shadow Spots → Repeat

.
**__Bouncing Blade__**
The 💙 first 🥇 special 💅👩 attack 🤼 occurs after 3 🏼😭 autos and he will 😜😠 throw 🙌 a 🕓💰 blade that 🏻 bounces between 🏾 you, 😒♂ other 🙄 players 📱📱 if available, and 🅱 then 👋😯 himself (it ❌ will 🤔👏 not 🚫 damage ☄ him), 😀👨 it ✊💩 will hit 👊👊 players 📱📱 3 🗣💵 times, ⌚ whether thats one player 🏋🏋 3 😭😭 times 🕐⌚ or 3 🕑 players 📱 1 🕴 time ⏰⏰ each.

.
**__Summon Spirits__**
He 😡 will summon a spirit 👻 dependent on 🔛 the 👨 area of 💦 the 😂♂ room that 😧👆 he's standing in, ➡🔚 that ☝ will walk 🏼🚶 towards ⛪ him. 😠 If 😂 it ❔ reaches melee distance of him 😂👱 it will 😛 be 🏻 consumed granting Greg a buff based 🔥👌 on 🤣 the 💦♂ spirit summoned.  The 🍰✨ ghosts that 😐 are summoned are 🔢💰 the spirts of 😩👨 Mania, Rage, 😤😤 and 🏿🏽 Delirium.
⬥ **Spirit 👻 of 🥗 Mania** - connecting causes his attack speed ⏩⏩ to increase. 💳
⬥ **Spirit of Rage** 😤 - connecting with 👐 him 😠😂 causes his damage ☄ to 👆 increase.
⬥ **Spirit 😌😌 of 💰 Delirium** - connecting causes his 💞 poison damage ☠ to 💦 increase. 💳💳
    • If 👏 using vb as 👦 advised you 👳 can entirely ignore this 👌👈 spirit. By 🏻 standing 🔪 in the 👏👢 northwest corner 💀💀 he 😨 will 🙋 only 😠 spawn this 👈⬇ spirit.

.
**__Shadow Spots__**
Finally 🕤🙌 he will 😜 do ✅😠 a 🎟👌 shadow spot 💗⏺ attack 🤼🤼 similar 👱 to ✌💰 the ❤👏 twin furies, certain 🤔 areas are marked ✒✒ with 🍨💰 shadows 🕶👤 that 🕵 you 💦🏥 must move out ↗ of 🌾🈸 to 🦊 avoid 🙅 a large mage hit, 😪😎 they 👥👥 come in 📥📥 small 🏼 clusters with one 🏻😬 being 🐝😑 directly on the spot 😂🐱 you 👆☝ are standing 🔪🏿 on 🔛 and 👏👏 a 👌😈 few nearby.

.
**__Clones__**
At 140k health he will summon 2 clones, and 😍 at ❓🍆 60k he will 💰👏 summon 3 ❤ clones, they have 😒 3k health ⛑ each 👏👏 and 🤜🌬 Greg may teleport to them 😱 at random.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net 🏆 a 💰🅱 lower 🤓😎 amount 🔢🔢 of kills ‼☠ per hour but 🙅😤 may 🏻 be 🅱 used if 👉🎵 you do not wish 👐 to 👁💰 put 💰 in 💗 high 🔊 amounts of 🔥😤 effort 🙁 into ➡ a 💰 mid level boss. 🏽😎

.
⬥ It 😠💦 is 💪 very 💁 effective for ⌛ title/pet hunting however 💰🖐 there are a few prerequisites in 🍌🌙 order to 💦 sustain yourself. 👌☝

.
⬥ It is important to pray <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> as you will be standing in melee distance optimally as the Masterwork spear of annihilation is BiS. 
    • You can substitute the 🙌👏 spear for a Terrasaur Maul or 💁🍆 Noxious Scythe.
        - If TMaul, expect 🤗🤗 lower survivability and ~10s slower kills. ‼☠ If Scythe, pray 🏻 range 🤤🤤 instead 🚔👍 and turn ↩🏃 off run. Roughly 15-20s 🔳 slower 😩 kills but ❌❄ still 🤞🙄 afk.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage relic**
⬥ <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> **Irit Incense Sticks** - provide antipoison against Gregorovic
⬥ **Saradomin godsword** - emergency ❗ special 💅 attack 🤼 if ☝🏿 you're really 😤😋 low on 👀☝ health when 🍑😩 you 👈😇 look 👁👀 back.
