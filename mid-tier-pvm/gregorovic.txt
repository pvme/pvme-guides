Sliske's general in the Heart of Glienor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be the hardest of the GWD2 bosses. This is generally due to his high accuracy and hard hits.

**__General Tips__**
The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off. Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up. Wait for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you. Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range), and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up. Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to the immunity provided by incense sticks. Dodge the shadow spots if they spawn, and continue to DPS.

.
A vampirism scrimshaw is used for extra sustain, and a halberd weapon is used to stay out of range of Greg's melee autos, which hit harder and are more accurate than his range autos. An <:aosor:544200033847869443> is used to increase the effectiveness of Protection prayers, making the fight easier.

> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
**__Attack Rotation__**
3 Autos → Bouncing Blade → 3 Autos → Summon Spirits → 3 Autos → Shadow Spots → Repeat

.
**__Bouncing Blade__**
The first special attack occurs after 3 autos and he will throw a blade that bounces between you, other players if available, and then himself (it will not damage him), it will hit players 3 times, whether thats one player 3 times or 3 players 1 time each.

.
**__Summon Spirits__**
He will summon a spirit dependent on the area of the room that he's standing in, that will walk towards him. If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned.  The ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium.
⬥ **Spirit of Mania** - connecting causes his attack speed to increase.
⬥ **Spirit of Rage** - connecting with him causes his damage to increase.
⬥ **Spirit of Delirium** - connecting causes his poison damage to increase.
    • If using vb as advised you can entirely ignore this spirit. By standing in the northwest corner he will only spawn this spirit.

.
**__Shadow Spots__**
Finally he will do a shadow spot attack similar to the twin furies, certain areas are marked with shadows that you must move out of to avoid a large mage hit, they come in small clusters with one being directly on the spot you are standing on and a few nearby.

.
**__Clones__**
At 140k health he will summon 2 clones, and at 60k he will summon 3 clones, they have 3k health each and Greg may teleport to them at random.

**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss.

.
⬥ It is very effective for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself.

.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:837129251857104946> **and** use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism as this method relies on constant healing.

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be.
    • Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but can be a slightly unsafe without a Superior Scrimshaw of Vampyrism. 
    • Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing and allows more chances for poison damage. However, you have to pay more attention to prayer points between kills.
    • Dark Magic provides extra damage, but similarly to Vampyrism you must pay more attention to prayer points. 
    • Do NOT use Berserker, as it will get you killed very easily.

.
⬥ Either a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation or a Laniakea's Spear will be most effective for this method. Average kill times vary very little between them.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage relic**
⬥ <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> **Irit Incense Sticks** - provide antipoison against Gregorovic
⬥ **Saradomin godsword** - emergency special attack if you're really low on health when you look back.
