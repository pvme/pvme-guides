> **Introduction**
Sliske's general in the Heart of Glienor, Gregorovic is largely considered to be the hardest of the GWD2 bosses. This is generally due to his high accuracy and hard hits.

For Gregorovic, it is **HIGHLY** recommended to use irit incense sticks at maximum potency, as it will nullify his poison mechanics entirely. 

The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off. Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up. Wait for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you. Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range), and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up. Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to venomblood. Dodge the shadow spots if they spawn, and continue to DPS.

A vampirism scrimshaw is used for extra sustain, and a halberd weapon is used to stay out of range of Greg's melee autos, which hit harder and are more accurate than his range autos. A shield and bladed dive switch are used for resonance and navigating the arena, respectively. An <:aos:513190158359724056> is used to increase the effectiveness of Protect from <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> , making the fight easier.

> **Mechanics:**

At 140k health he will summon 2 clones, and at 60k he will summon 3 clones, they have 3k health each and Greg may teleport to them at random.

The following specs are his main spec rotation, there are 3 autos between each spec, and the fight is started with 3 autos before the first spec occurs

**Bouncing blade**
The first special attack occurs after 3 autos and he will throw a blade that bounces between you, other players if available, and then himself (it will not damage him), it will hit players 3 times, whether thats one player 3 times or 3 players 1 time each.

**Summon Spirits**
He will summon a spirit dependent on the area of the room that he's standing in, that will walk towards him. If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned.
The ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium.
Spirit of Mania connecting causes his attack speed to increase.
Spirit of Rage connecting with him causes his damage to increase.
Spirit of Delirium connecting causes his poison damage to increase. If using vb as advised you can entirely ignore this spirit. By standing in the northwest corner he will only spawn this spirit.

**Shadow spots**
Finally he will do a shadow spot attack similar to the twin furies, certain areas are marked with shadows that you must move out of to avoid a large mage hit, they come in small clusters with one being directly on the spot you are standing on and a few nearby.
