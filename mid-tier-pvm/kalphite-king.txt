.tag:strats
    • <:anti:535541306475151390> before and <:zerk:535532854004678657> at the start of every kill.

    • Never stun outside ⛈ of proper stun timings.

    • Stay 👩🛌 close ↔😜 to ⏸ the 👏 tank during 🏃🏃 digs but 🍑🌚 not 🙅 in 😻💀 the 🏆👏 surface 🍑🌎 radius. 

    • Run 😂🏃 with 💘😉 the boss during 🏃🚣 charges. 💸💸

    • <:anti:535541306475151390> or <:freedom:535541258240786434> at the start of range and magic phases, use the other defensive when your first runs out.

    • <:anti:535541306475151390> during mage charge.

    • <:res:535541258844635148> blue ball during mage phase (usually happens the attack after mage charge if you forget how to count).

    • Use <:freedom:535541258240786434> on melee phase only after you receive both bleeds. If you <:freedom:535541258240786434> a dismember before you get slaughtered you’re not going to have a fun time, especially if you get pushed.

.
    • The amount of times you get hit by the standard attack while the Incendiary Shot icon (<:incend:535541258429661215>)is on your buff bar is the amount of times you will be hit by the Incendiary Shot 

    • If you get a stun with the Incendiary Shot after green, don’t freedom. Either wait until the stun clears and <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to KK when he surfaces or <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to minions to clear and then <:bd:535532854281764884> back to KK.

    • Don’t 🙈🚫 stand 🕴 directly between 🖕👉 KK and 💰🗣 a 🅰 wall during 🚣🏃 melee or mage phase 🌗🌔 or 🏻 you 😋😀 will be 🙋 hit up to 5k.

    • Use <:devo:513190158728953857> during the first 4 autos of mage phase so you can continue to attack the boss without moving.

Don’t <:bd:535532854281764884> during range phase. Always skip green with a stun. If you use <:destroy:535532879330148352> remember to cancel after 1 GCD.
.
1. 😭 Melee charge happens or 🔮 is 💦 skipped.
        - If learning, 🤗 not 🚫 skipping charge is recommended so 👱 you can learn 📚🎓 how 🏼 to get an 💶👹 accurate count 🙌 on attacks. 
2. 😳👀 Count 🙌 2 ⛱🍳 KK autos.
3*. Equip shield or defender if you are learning. Can be done after <:bd:535532854281764884> when more experienced.
3. <:freedom:535541258240786434> 
4. Let the 😈 boss 👨 green 😜 you
5. Queue <:bd:535532854281764884> and aim away from walls and minions
        -Never <:bd:535532854281764884> through KK
6. 💪❗ Look 👁👁 at 👨 the 👏👏 stun timer
7. As the 👑 timer drops from 4 💦 to 3 👏 seconds, 🕥 click 🖱 the Bladed Dive spot
8. 👊 Quickly ⏰🆘 equip shield ⚗⚗ or 🚻 defender if not already equipped
9. <:devo:513190158728953857>, <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> (Only <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523>  if there are no minions)

**If you get greened solo, you can spam Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> and a teleport to avoid death.**
