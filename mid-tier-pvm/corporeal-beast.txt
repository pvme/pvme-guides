The Corporeal Beast 🔞 is 💦 a 🚪 boss 👨😎 unlocked 🔓 from 😮💥 completing the *Summer's 😂❤ End* quest. 🗺🗺 If 👏👏 you 🏻 followed the 👧 lore behind the quest, you will 🤔👏 understand 🤷 why ❓❓ summoning familiars cannot be 💪 used 📅🆒 at 🤖💯 the ❄👌 boss, meaning ❌ that 👁 you 👏😖 can only ❗👋 use 👏👏 the 💦 items in your inventory. A 👏 legendary 💎💎 pet 🐕🐶 can 🔫💰 be 🤓💗 used 👨🚟 here. 🏾💪 Furthermore, any 🍵💦 weapon 🏹 that 😧😝 isn't a 💦👌 spear will 🏾 deal half damage, ☠ meaning that melee is the only 🕦✋ style 💦💀 you 😍 should 💦👫 use.

**__General__**
As stated 🗣 before, 🎄⬅ any weapon that isn't a 🐙✔ spear will 💰👏 deal half 🅱 damage, ☠☠ so melee is the only 😫👀 style 💦 that 😻 should be 🐝 used at 🍆 this 🖖❌ boss. 👨👴 If you 👈 don't have 🙌🈶 a 👉 T92 spear then 😓 Reaper necklace 💍 is 👶 greatly preferred 📦📦 over 🔜 the amulet of 🤔 souls, as 💰👦 you 👈 do 👀👺 not 🙅🚫 have 100% 💯💯 hit 😤👊 chance. 🚫😨 The Masuta's Warspear does ❓😳 work at 🙈🍆 Corporeal Beast 🔞😋 (tested on 😳 approximately ⭕⭕ 200+ kills) ‼☠ and 👏🎅 may be used 👨 in 👏 a solo 🎸 situation as 😥 you 👈 will 😳🤔 not 🙅 have 🍆😂 to 🍆💦 prayer 📢🏼 flick for melee swipes, however this 👈 is less optimal.

.
**__Advanced Melee Preset__**
Weapon poison <:weppoison:689525476158472288> will stack with the cinderbanes effect. A vampyrism scrimshaw will help sustain longer trips, and a cannon can be used for extra damage output (kinetic cyclone <:kineticcyclone:798285651405438997> is used over coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> as it does more damage, albeit at the cost of range). Jellyfish <:blueblubber:689530593742291033> and brews <:Brew:565726489400573962> can be used for general healing without adrenaline loss.

**__Auto Attacks__**
The 😂🚟 Corporeal Beast will 📎 attack ⚔⚔ with 👏 only 👏🔥 magic ✨📿 attacks if 🤥👏 you are outside of 💦 melee distance. If 💲 you 👌 are within 😱 melee distance, the 🌾 boss will 🔥 use 👏 both melee and magic. Melee swipes are 💩 noticeable when 😩 the boss 😎 swipes with 👏 its 🏾🏾 front 🏡✋ two ✌🎄 legs. 👀 Also, 😛 protection prayers 🏽🙏 will 🐼🤔 not halve incoming damage, instead 🔖 only partially reducing damage. ☄ 
⬥ Magic 📿✨ attacks will do 🏆💕 an 😙 AOE splash on 😎 their 👭😂 target in 👌 a 👌 3x3 square. This 👈🕓 means you 😍🙋 should 🤔😕 stand ♂ at ❓ least 😂 2 💬 squares away 😬 from 👉 your 🍆 partner(s), if 🅱 applicable.

.
**__Core__**
Occasionally, 🐶🐶 a 👌🚨 dark 🕶🔫 core 💰 will ✊👏 spawn and jump 🏃👏 towards ⛪ its 🌲😡 target. This dark 🌌🔫 core 💰 will do constant 🔆 typeless damage ☄☄ and 😍➕ will 🍡🖕 heal the 💰 boss 😂 unless 💁👏 it 😍❓ is 🖍😝 killed ❌☠ or 💰💁 you 👊 step 👞👞 away 😱 from it. 😍 It 💋🗨 will 😜💦 do 💯 typeless hits unless 👏 you 👁 are 💁💰 more 🤹 than 😻 1 square away.

.tag:gudcorp
**__Misc Things to Have__**
Legendary pet for picking 🏻 items ⚔🛡 (do 👌 not ❌🙅 add 👈👈 a 💰👏 familiar, 👨🤓 just 💢❗ summon the ⏪🅾 legendary 💎 pet), cannon with autorefill, disruption shield, ZGS spec. 

.
None ♀♀ of ✝ these 😍 are 💓 mandatory, but 😭 will 😘📃 noticeably increase kills/hr. Not 🍆✖ owning 💥 a 💰🍵 ZGS probably 😻 lowers kph by around 🔃👥 10.
Corp is 💯 an 👹🐎 outdated boss 😎 with 😲 slow ⏰🕰 spawn times, 😭 thanks 🏿🙏 to it 😂🔜 having 👉🍽 an 👹 easily 😂😂 accessible public 🚋😳 instance 🤓 you can 💦🔫 abuse and 👏😏 this is 🤔 what the ⚰🌧 method is based on.
Kills 😵 will 👄 be 💎 alternated between 🏻🖕 the 🌃🌫 public 🗽🚋 and 👏😈 private 🕵 instances.

.
**__Corp Tech__**
Corp has 💰👏 the 👏⭐ mechanic where 😾 he 🅱😽 only 🕦🕦 takes 💜 full damage ☠☄ from spears, though 👉💀 there 💍✔ is 🚟👌 a 👭😤 way ↕ get 👏 around which 😡 increases ⤴📄 your kills ☠ if 👏😂 used enough. 💦⏰ 
It 👀 is 🔥💦 done ⌛💯 in 👏 these 🖼👈 steps:
1. 👱🌸 Run 😱 out 🅱 of 😊 md
2. Cast the dw ability you want to use and ✋➕ click 🖱 the ground 🏞👇
3. Equip your spear and click corp (you only use Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> and gFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>). This gives you another 188 ability to use and pretty much cuts out smash and worse abilities from your rotation.

.
__**Optional Rotations for No 😈😩 ZGS**__
⬥ These arent necessarily optimal but instead of throwing a ZGS spec (because you don't own one), you will abuse Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Blood tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> as they are very strong.

.

**__Tips/Notes__**
⬥ Since 👨👨 the kills are 😩💯 so fast, ♂ you can 💯🔫 leave 💯🍃 the 🎁 non-instanced 🚫 loot on 🏽 the ground 🔝📈 every other kill. When 😂 Corp dies, 💀⚰ call ☣💋 your 😩👧 legendary 💎💎 pet and renew cannon (if 💲👏 needed) and exit. You 👉 can 💁 leave 🛫🏃 the 🐕👑 loot on 💰🎶 the 👺👏 ground 📈 in the world 🔥🌍 instance 🙄 and every other 👈 kill 👻💞 you 💪 can 🤸 go ⏩♀ loot the 👏 old loot along 🔚 with 🤤 the 🏻🍂 new and leave.

.
⬥ For instanced kills, you let your 💪 pet 🐈🐕 pick ⛏ up 👀😍 the 👏🤔 loot. After it 💯😍 has visually taken 🙏🙏 the loot, you ☝☝ wait 🏽 2-4 ticks and 🏿🔜 click 🖱🖱 exit (1 ☠ tick before ⬇😩 it's in 💗 your 👱 inventory, you can 💦 leave and 👏 still 👉😻 get ⏬ it).

.
⬥ During 🚣 an 💶 hour 🕐 you 👈😣 should bank 🏛🏦 twice. ✌ This 👇 method is recommended to 🅱 everyone 👉👨 intending to 👉😫 do 🅱👌 Corp even 🌃🆗 if 🏼💦 you 💋🍯 aren't the most ❄💯 experienced 🤳🤳 player, 👨🎮 since 💦👨 this 😅 just 🏻💭 kills 😵 most of ✝ the 🙀🌜 waiting ⌚💤 time ⏱ essentially increasing your 👉 efficiency.

.
⬥ The dark core doesn't use up your disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523>, so you can <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> camp with it even if the core is on you.

.
> **__AFK Method (~55 kph)__** (Credit to <@!159421704270118912>)
.tag:afk
**__Explanation__**
This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. It is useful for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself. This method utilizes <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> and <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>. Potion reservoirs may allow increased AFK time up to 36 minutes, resulting in only needing to make sure the player isn't lobbied; however, picking up some drops is advised.

.
**__Preset__**
