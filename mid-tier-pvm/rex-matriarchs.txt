.tag:intro
The rex matriarchs are a trio of dinosaur bosses found on anachronia. They drop components required to make the Reaver's <:reaverring:839903943018283050>, Stalker's <:stalkerring:839903943601029120>, Champion's <:championring:839903943630520350> and Channeller's <:channellerring:839903943404027914> rings. Additionally, they also drop the 4 spear parts making up Laniakea's Spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454>, a halberd-range stab weapon with T90 damage, T75 accuracy and a passive that increases weapon poison frequency and damage by 5%.

.
**__General Information__**
The rex matriarchs are notable for their <:Defence:689509250979987525> levels of 96. While slayer helmet <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> bonuses are applicable to them, enhanced Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> is not. They also serve as good bosses to learn basic hybriding for significantly higher kph.

    • 3 AA → **Frost Storm** → 1 AA → **Magic Attack** → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 3 AA → **Pyroclastic Shock** → **Magic Attack** → 2 AA → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 2 AA → **Magic Attack** → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 3 AA → **Pyroclastic Shock** → **Magic Attack** → Repeat

.
⬥ **Frost Storm** - Orikalka spins and generates an ice tornado. Players within 15 tiles are dealt up to 4500 magic damage.
    • Frostbite: Global cooldown for hit players are doubled for 30 seconds.
    • The hit drains run energy is 0%.

⬥ **Pyroclastic Shock** - Orikalka performs a tail sweep and generates 3 fissures.
    • Standing on them deal rapid melee damage up to 3000 per hit with the final hit dealing 5000-6000 damage if Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is not used.
    • If frostbite is active, all hits after the first deal 1 damage provided Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is used, removing frostbite and providing an **Adrenaline Rush**.

.
⬥ **Adrenaline Rush** - 10% adrenaline is gained every tick for 10 ticks (100% adrenaline total).

⬥ **Mage Attack** - Orikalka launches a blue orb that deals low damage.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Attack Cycle: 
    • 3 Auto Attack(AA) → **Poison Bombardment** → 1 AA → **Melee Attack** → 5 AA → **Melee Attack** → 1 AA → **Poison Absorption** → 3 AA → **Melee Attack** → 5 AA → **Melee Attack** → Repeat

.
⬥ **Poison Bombardment** - Rathis launches 2 poison orbs.
    • One or both will fall onto the player.
    • Deal up to 3500 ranged damage each to players standing in a 5x5 radius.
    • Leave behind 2 **Poison Pits**.  

⬥ **Poison Pits** - 5x5 green pits persist on the ground following **Poison Bombardment**.
    • Players take 300-500 poison damage per tick standing on them (reduced to 50-100 by venomblood/antipoison effect).
    • A Corrosion debuff is applied with each stack causing players to take 20% more damage, up to 5 stacks, lasting 10 seconds form the last poison absorbed.
        - The 10 second timer is reset as long as the player stands on the poison.
    • Players standing in the pits reduce the size of the patches, turning from a 5x5 to 3x3, then to a 1x1 with an AoE of 2x2, and finally a normal 1x1. 

.
⬥ **Poison Absorption** - Rathis absorbs leftover poison
    • She is healed based on the amount of remaining acid. 
    • Each patch heals up to 35000 health at maximum size.

⬥ **Melee Attack** - She lunges towards the player, dealing a relatively weak melee hit.
    • If not within melee range, Rathis will charge the player, dealing up to 4500 soft typeless damage, disabling prayers <:antitheism:787523880281047040> and stunning them.

⬥ Attack Cycle: 
    • 3 Auto Attack(AA) → **Converging Lightning** → 1 AA → **Ranged Attack** → **Overcharge** → 3 AA → **Converging Lightning** → 1 AA → **Ranged Attack** → Repeat

    • One bolt will where the target player is.
    • They deal 5000-5500 magic damage every 2 ticks.
        - This damage is reduced by 90% when wearing insulated boots.

⬥ **Overcharge** - An overhead bar appears on the target player. When the timer expires a 3x3 torrent will appear at the player's tile.
    • The torrent applies the **Overcharged** buff.
    • It deals increasing hard typeless damage capping out at 3600 every 2 ticks.

.
⬥ **Overcharged** - For 30 seconds an additional magic damage hit is caused by players' abilities and attacks (excluding poison) at 5% of their original damage.
    • The cooldown of Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> is reduced to 1 tick. Getting hit by the torrent refreshes the **Overcharged** buff.

⬥ **Ranged Attack** - Pthentraken spins, sending a rock flying towards the player which deals up to 3500 ranged damage.

.
> **__General Strategy__**
.tag:strategy
**__Orikalka__**
⬥ Orikalka should be killed using 2-3 Entangles <:ent:567727987274022924> (to avoid frostbite) and fire spells <:FireSurge:543465116092334083>.

⬥ 4TAA is recommended to increase DPS and weave in <:ent:567727987274022924> (and Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> if not using <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

⬥ Start the kill with a Guthix Staff special attack <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> if having low accuracy.

.
⬥ Prioritise bleeds <:comb:535533833098100745>/<:corruptblast:513190159194259467> until first <:ent:567727987274022924> lands. Immediately build to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> .
    • Use a wand and a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> with Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> to <:ent:567727987274022924> and <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
        - A defender is recommended for the accuracy boost it provides.
        - Watching for a magic xp drop can assist in confirming <:ent:567727987274022924> has landed. 
    • Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> should be used almost whenever it is off cooldown to build when Orikalka is stunned/rooted.

⬥ Once Orikalka moves, use <:ent:567727987274022924> again and move to the other side of your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid attacks.

.
⬥ If Orikalka is not dead when the second <:ent:567727987274022924> ends, kite her with stuns like Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> and Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> or do a 3rd <:ent:567727987274022924> depending on hp.

⬥ If you get Frostbite, Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and do not kill Orikalka. Wait until fissures spawn, and then run or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to one.

Dealing with Frostbite

.
**__Pthentraken__**
⬥ Prayer flicking every auto attack is strongly recommended as she hits the hardest of the three, especially the ranged attack.

⬥ If not using Insulated Boots, move to avoid Converging Lighting to edge tiles of Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>. Stay here to place the Overcharge Torrent and then return to the middle.

⬥ When the next Converging Lighting begins, run to the other side of <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>.

.
⬥ If using Insulated Boots, simply turn on Deflect Mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> during Converging Lighting to take almost no damage. Flick to Deflect Missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> after the lighting passes for the ranged attack.

⬥ Staying closer to this boss will make her attacks land sooner.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Avoiding first Poison Bombardment is recommended as you are likely under Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, and can get bursted if both projectiles land on you.

⬥ Stand on a Poison Pit to reduce the overheal if not confident in killing Rathis before poison absorption.

⬥ Antipoison potion effect and the Venomblood perk both reduce poison damage, but Irit Incense Sticks <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> *do not.*

.
> **__Introduction to Hybrid Strategies__**
.tag:presets
In general, use weapons of at least T90 accuracy that allow you to exploit the weaknesses of the Matriarchs.
If not owning weapons to hit on their respective weakness(e.g. Do not own a T90+ bow) or weapons are low tier, ensure that you’re on task/zerker aura/highest accuracy aura for that style.

*Note: Most of the presets listed focus on high level hybriding which can easily yield more than 70 kph. Due to the number of combinations available, intermediate presets are not provided.*

.
**__Alternatives to Listed Strategies__**
⬥ If Blessed Flask <:blessedflask:659122178704408598> is not owned, presets should be made for 30 minute combat instead of camping the entire instance.
⬥ 4 Restore Flasks <:restore:642708657825644554> are recommended in such a preset.
⬥ Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> and Kwuarm Incense Sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> can be included in a bonfire preset instead to make more inventory space.
⬥ Perked hybrid armour such as Sliske’s Anima body and legs <:SliskeBody:513204700980576266> <:AnimalegsSliske:556592073042821122> can be taken instead, although this will reduce kph.

**__Strategy__**
⬥ Aim to end Orikalka kills with 100% adrenaline.

⬥ Execute a <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> rotation on Rathis to ensure she is killed before poison absorption. 

⬥ Alternate use of adrenaline potions <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> with gBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to guarantee burst on Rathis.

⬥ You may use Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> to apply the first hit of Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> with Ingenuity <:ingen:641339234111848463> and switch to your main stab weapons. Otherwise, <:ingen:641339234111848463> should be used on the second <:ent:567727987274022924> under Sun <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid splashing.

⬥ If you end Orikalka not with 100% adren, target Rathis from a distance and use basics to gain adrenaline.

Some afk strategies are also viable for the rex matriarchs, except Pthentraken.

.
**__Rathis__**
Camp Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. If using lower tiered armor or otherwise notice that you constantly require food, Vampirism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> should be taken along with 10 Super Restore flasks <:restore:642708657825644554> and holy wrench to upkeep prayer. This setup yields about 40-42 kph.

**__Orikalka__**
Use Legacy with Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> (Blood Blitz <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> if using inquisitor's staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>) as Frostbite does not affect the speed of auto attacks. Use Deflect Melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> to avoid getting bursted by unlucky fissure spawns. Even through prayer and death ward, fissures can still kill if unlucky. Thus, it is not completely recommended to afk using this preset. Use the highest tier of restoration portent available to you. Absorbative and Enhanced Devoted perks help survive unlucky fissures. This setup yields about 30 kph.
