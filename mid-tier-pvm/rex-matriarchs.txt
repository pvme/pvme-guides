.tag:intro
The rex matriarchs are a trio of dinosaur bosses found on anachronia. They drop components required to make the reaver's<:reaverring:839903943018283050>, stalker's<:stalkerring:839903943601029120>, champion's<:championring:839903943630520350> and channeller's<:channellerring:839903943404027914> rings. Additionally, they also drop the 4 spear parts making up laniakea's spear<:lanispear:839903893177106454>, a halberd-range stab weapon with T90 damage, T75 accuracy and a passive that increases weapon poison frequency and damage by 5%. 

**__General information__**
The rex matriarchs are notable for their <:Defence:689509250979987525> levels of 96. While slayer bonuses<:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> are applicable to them, enhanced Tuska's Wrath<:Tuskas:513201065513058306> is not. They also serve as good bosses to learn basic hybriding for significantly higher kph.

.
> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
All matriarchs have mechanics centered around area denial elaborated on below.
.
**__Orikalka__**
⬥ Orikalka has 2 possible attack cycles:

Cycle 1:
3 auto attacks → **Frost storm** → 1 auto attack → **Magic attack** → **Pyroclastic shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic shock** → 1 auto attack → **Magic attack** → Repeat

Cycle 2:
3 auto attacks → **Frost storm** → 1 auto attack → **Magic attack** → **Pyroclastic shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic shock** → **Magic attack** → 2 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic shock** → 2 auto attacks → **Magic attack** → **Pyroclastic shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic shock** → **Magic attack** → Repeat
    
⬥ **Frost storm**: Orikalka spins, dealing up to 4500 magic damage to players within 15 tiles, doubling global cooldown for 30 seconds and draining run energy to 0%.

⬥ **Pyroclastic shock**: Orikalka performs a tail sweep and generates 3 fissures. Standing on them deal rapid melee damage up to 3000 per hit with the final hit dealing 5000-6000 damage if deflect melee<:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is not used. If frostbite is active, all hits after the first deal 1 damage provided deflect melee<:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is used, removing frostbite and providing an **Adrenaline rush**.

⬥ **Adrenaline rush**: 10% adrenaline is gained every tick for 6 seconds (100% adrenaline total).

⬥ **Mage attack**: Orikalka uses a weak hitting magic attack in the form of a blue orb.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Attack cycle: 3 auto attacks → **Poison bombardment** → 1 auto attack → **Melee attack** → 5 auto attacks → **Melee attack** → 1 auto attack → **Poison absorption** → 3 auto attacks → **Melee attack** → 5 auto attacks → **Melee attack** → Repeat

⬥ **Poison bombardment**: Rathis launches 2 poison orbs. One or both will fall onto the player, dealing up to 3500 ranged damage to players standing in a 5x5 radius, leaving behind 2 **poison pits**.  

⬥ **Poison pits**: Players take 300-500 poison damage per tick standing on them (reduced to 50-100 by venomblood/antipoison effect). A Corrosion debuff is applied with each stack causing players to take 20% more damage, up to 5 stacks, lasting 10 seconds form the last poison absorbed. The 10 second timer is reset as long as the player stands on the poison. Players standing in the pits reduce the size of the patches, turning from 5x5 to 3x3, to a 1x1 with an AoE of 2x2, and finally a normal 1x1. 

⬥ **Poison absorption**: Rathis absorbs leftover poison, healing based on the amount of remaining acid. Each patch heals up to 35000 health at maximum size.

⬥ **Melee attack**: If not within melee range, Rathis will charge the player, dealing up to 4500 soft typeless damage, disabling prayers<:antitheism:787523880281047040> and stunning them. Otherwise, she lunges the player dealing a relatively weak melee hit.

.
**__Pthentraken__**
⬥ Attack cycle: 3 auto attacks → **Converging lightning** → 1 auto attack → **Ranged attack** → **Overcharge** → 3 auto attacks → **Converging lightning** → 1 auto attack → **Ranged attack** → Repeat

⬥ **Converging lightning**: Pthentraken roars and summons 3-5 lighting bolts, with paths indicated by brown markings. One bolt will where the target player is. They deal 5000-5500 magic damage every 2 ticks. This damage is reduced by 90% if wearing insulated boots.

⬥ **Overcharge**: An overhead bar appears on the target player. When the timer expires a 3x3 torrent will appear at the player's tile. The torrent applies the overcharged buff and deals increasing hard typeless damage capping out at 3600 every 2 ticks. 

⬥ **Overcharge buff**: For 30 seconds, player's abilities and attacks (excluding poison) deal an additional 5% of the original hit in magic damage. The global cooldown of surge<:surge:535533810004262912> is reduced to 1 tick. Getting hit by the torrent refreshes the buff. 

⬥ **Ranged attack**: Pthentraken spins, sending a rock flying towards the player dealing up to 3500 ranged damage.

.
> **__Strategy__**
.tag:strategy

**__Orikalka__**
⬥ Orikalka should be killed using 2-3 entangles<:ent:567727987274022924>(to avoid frostbite) and fire spells <:FireSurge:543465116092334083>. 

⬥ 4TAA is recommended to increase DPS and weave in ent<:ent:567727987274022924> (and vuln<:Vuln:537349530551582720> if not using bombs<:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

⬥ Start the kill with a gstaff spec<:gstaff:513203008608141314><:spec:537340400273195028> if having low accuracy. 

⬥ Prioritise bleeds <:comb:535533833098100745><:corruptblast:513190159194259467> until first ent<:ent:567727987274022924> lands. Immediately build to sunshine<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> . 
    • Use a wand and a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> with planted feet<:pf:689501925770919981> to ent<:ent:567727987274022924>(accuracy bonus) and sun<:Sunshine:583430011948630016>. 
    • You will know ent<:ent:567727987274022924> has landed when a 60 mage xp drop appears. 
    • Wrack<:wrack:535533809823645697> should be used almost whenever off cooldown to build when Orikalka is stunned/rooted.

⬥ Once Orikalka moves, use second ent<:ent:567727987274022924>, and move to the other side of sun<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid attacks. 

⬥ If Orikalka is not dead when the second ent<:ent:567727987274022924> ends, kite her with stuns like deep impact<:deep:535533833139912724> or asphyxiate<:asphyx:535533833072672778>, or do a 3rd ent<:ent:567727987274022924> depending on hp.

⬥ If you get frostbite, deflect melee<:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and do not kill orikalka. Wait until fissures spawn, and then run or bladed dive<:bd:535532854281764884> to one.

.
**__Pthentraken__**
⬥ Prayer flicking every auto attack is strongly recommended as she hits the hardest, especially the ranged attack.

⬥ If not using insulation boots, move to avoid converging lighting to edge tiles of Death's swiftness<:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>. Stay here to place the overcharge torrent and then return to the middle. 

⬥ When the next converging lighting begins, run to the other side of DS<:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>. 

⬥ If using insulation boots, simply turn on deflect mage<:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> during converging lighting to take almost no damage. Flick to deflect missiles<:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> after the lighting passes for the ranged attack.

⬥ Staying closer to this boss will make attacks land sooner.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Avoiding first poison bombardment is recommended as you are likely zerked<:Berserk:513190158468907012>, and can get bursted if both projectiles land on you.

⬥ Stand on a poison pit to reduce the overheal if not confident in killing Rathis before poison absorption.

⬥ Antipoison potion effect and venomblood perk works to reduce poison damage, but irit incense sticks<:IritSticks:690987265371144202> **DO NOT work**.

.
> **__Presets and specific strategies__**
.tag:presets
Most of the presets listed focus on high level hybriding which can easily yield more than 70 kph. Due to the number of combinations available, intermediate presets are not provided. 
In general, use weapons which exploit the weaknesses of the matriarchs that are at least **T90** in accuracy. 
If not owning weapons to hit on their appropriate weakness(e.g. Do not own a T90+ bow) or weapons are low tier, ensure that you’re on task/zerker aura/highest accuracy aura for that style.

.
**__Mage/Ranged__**
2 Versions are provided, 1 with physical ECB<:ecb:615618531937222657> and the other with Hexhunter bow<:hexhunterbow:581180369911414794> and EoF ECB<:ecb:615618531937222657><:eofpink:780401412865523722>, of which the latter is better by a little bit.

**For both**

**Specific strategies**
⬥ Focus on killing Pthentraken fast with ECB spec<:ecb:615618531937222657><:spec:537340400273195028> under DS<:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>
⬥ Restore hp using SS<:soulsplit:615613924506599497> while kiting Orikalka.
⬥ Adren pots<:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> should be used on ranged kills. 
⬥ Ingen<:ingen:641339234111848463> should be used on the second ent<:ent:567727987274022924> under sun<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to reduce the need to run out of sun<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> because of splashes.

**__Mage/Melee__**
⬥ <:runepouch:583430011868938283>**Rune Pouch**: <:Firerune:536252659850674186> <:Airrune:536252658986647589> <:Naturerune:536252660270104591> (Runes for <:FireSurge:543465116092334083>+<:ent:567727987274022924>)

.img:https://imgur.com/SJsLm3V.png

**Specific strategies**
⬥ Aim to end Orikalka kills with 100% adrenaline.
⬥ Execute a <:zerk:535532854004678657><:gbarge:535532879250456578> rotation on Rathis to ensure she is killed before poison absorption. 
⬥ Adren pot<:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and limitless<:limitless:641339233638023179> should be used in alternation with gbarge<:gbarge:535532879250456578> to guarantee burst on Rathis. 
⬥ You may use tmaul<:terramaul:602561894829522954> to apply the first hit of assault<:assault:535532853979512842> with ingen<:ingen:641339234111848463> and switch to main stab weapons. Otherwise, ingen<:ingen:641339234111848463> should be used on the second ent<:ent:567727987274022924> under sun<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid splashes. 
⬥ If ending Orikalka not with 100% adren, use basics and defensives from a distance targetting Rathis to gain adrenaline.

**Alternatives**
⬥ If blessed flask<:blessedflask:659122178704408598> is not owned, presets should be made for 30 minute combat instead of camping the instance.
⬥ 4 restore flasks<:restore:642708657825644554> are recommended in such a preset. 
⬥ Reaver<:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> and kwuarm incense sticks<:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> can be included in a bonfire preset instead to make more inventory space. 
⬥ Perked hybrid armour such as Sliske’s anima body and legs<:SliskeBody:513204700980576266><:AnimalegsSliske:556592073042821122> can be taken instead, although this will reduce kph.

.
**__Beginner hybrid__**
This serves as approximately the baseline equipment you need to effectively hybrid in an instance using Mage/Ranged.

⬥ P6E4<:p6:712073088769982475><:eq4:712073088589627505> on main weapons for both styles

Some afk strategies are also viable for the rex matriarchs, except Pthentraken.

⬥ <:furyofthesmall:697808773917573233> **Fury of the Small**
⬥ <:berserkersfury:697808774106185768> **Berserker's Fury**

Camp SS<:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. If using lower tiered armor or otherwise notice that you constantly require food, vamp aura<:vamp:643505653079343144> should be taken along with 10 super restore flasks<:restore:642708657825644554> and holy wrench to upkeep prayer. This setup yields about 40-42 kph.

.
**__Orikalka__**
Use legacy with blood barrage<:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>(blitz<:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> if using inquisitor's staff<:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>) as frostbite does not affect the speed of auto attacks.

**Preset**

Use deflect melee<:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> to avoid getting bursted by unlucky fissure spawns. Even through prayer and death ward, fissures can still kill if unlucky. Thus, it is not completely recommended to afk using this preset.
