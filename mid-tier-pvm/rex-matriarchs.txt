.tag:intro
The rex matriarchs are a trio of dinosaur bosses found on anachronia. They drop components required to make the reaver's <:reaverring:839903943018283050>, stalker's <:stalkerring:839903943601029120>, champion's <:championring:839903943630520350> and channeller's <:channellerring:839903943404027914> rings. Additionally, they also drop the 4 spear parts making up laniakea's spear <:lanispear:839903893177106454>, a halberd-range stab weapon with T90 damage, T75 accuracy and a passive that increases weapon poison frequency and damage by 5%.

.
**__General Information__**
The rex matriarchs are notable for their <:Defence:689509250979987525> levels of 96. While slayer bonuses <:slayerhelm:798285340460449792> are applicable to them, enhanced Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> is not. They also serve as good bosses to learn basic hybriding for significantly higher kph.

> **__Mechanics__**
.tag:mechanics
All matriarchs have mechanics centered around area denial elaborated on below.

.
**__Orikalka__**
⬥ Orikalka has 2 possible attack cycles:
    • Cycle 1:
3 auto attacks → **Frost Storm** → 1 auto attack → **Magic Attack** → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 1 auto attack → **Magic Attack** → Repeat

    • Cycle 2:
3 auto attacks → **Frost Storm** → 1 auto attack → **Magic Attack** → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic Shock** → **Magic Attack** → 2 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 2 auto attacks → **Magic Attack** → **Pyroclastic Shock** → 3 auto attacks → **Pyroclastic Shock** → **Magic Attack** → Repeat

.
⬥ **Frost Storm** - Orikalka spins, dealing up to 4500 magic damage to players within 15 tiles, doubling global cooldown for 30 seconds and draining run energy to 0%.

⬥ **Pyroclastic Shock** - Orikalka performs a tail sweep and generates 3 fissures.
    • Standing on them deal rapid melee damage up to 3000 per hit with the final hit dealing 5000-6000 damage if deflect melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is not used.
    • If frostbite is active, all hits after the first deal 1 damage provided deflect melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> is used, removing frostbite and providing an **Adrenaline Rush**.

.
⬥ **Adrenaline Rush** - 10% adrenaline is gained every tick for 6 seconds (100% adrenaline total).

⬥ **Mage Attack** - Orikalka uses a weak hitting magic attack in the form of a blue orb.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Attack Cycle:
3 auto attacks → **Poison Bombardment** → 1 auto attack → **Melee Attack** → 5 auto attacks → **Melee Attack** → 1 auto attack → **Poison Absorption** → 3 auto attacks → **Melee Attack** → 5 auto attacks → **Melee Attack** → Repeat

.
⬥ **Poison Bombardment** - Rathis launches 2 poison orbs.
    • One or both will fall onto the player.
    • Deal up to 3500 ranged damage each to players standing in a 5x5 radius.
    • Leave behind 2 **Poison Pits**.  

⬥ **Poison Pits** - 5x5 green pits persist on the ground following **Poison Bombardment**.
    • Players take 300-500 poison damage per tick standing on them (reduced to 50-100 by venomblood/antipoison effect).
    • A Corrosion debuff is applied with each stack causing players to take 20% more damage, up to 5 stacks, lasting 10 seconds form the last poison absorbed.
        - The 10 second timer is reset as long as the player stands on the poison.
    • Players standing in the pits reduce the size of the patches, turning from 5x5 to 3x3, to a 1x1 with an AoE of 2x2, and finally a normal 1x1. 

.
⬥ **Poison Absorption** - Rathis absorbs leftover poison, healing based on the amount of remaining acid. Each patch heals up to 35000 health at maximum size.

⬥ **Melee Attack** - She lunges towards the player, dealing a relatively weak melee hit.
    • If not within melee range, Rathis will charge the player, dealing up to 4500 soft typeless damage, disabling prayers <:antitheism:787523880281047040> and stunning them.

.
**__Pthentraken__**
⬥ Attack Cycle:
3 auto attacks → **Converging Lightning** → 1 auto attack → **Ranged Attack** → **Overcharge** → 3 auto attacks → **Converging Lightning** → 1 auto attack → **Ranged Attack** → Repeat

.
⬥ **Converging Lightning** - Pthentraken roars and summons 3-5 lighting bolts, with paths indicated by brown markings.
    • One bolt will where the target player is.
    • They deal 5000-5500 magic damage every 2 ticks.
        - This damage is reduced by 90% if wearing insulated boots.

⬥ **Overcharge** - An overhead bar appears on the target player. When the timer expires a 3x3 torrent will appear at the player's tile.
    • The torrent applies the overcharged buff and deals increasing hard typeless damage capping out at 3600 every 2 ticks.

.
⬥ **Overcharge Buff** - For 30 seconds, player's abilities and attacks (excluding poison) deal an additional 5% of the original hit in magic damage.
    • The global cooldown of surge <:surge:535533810004262912> is reduced to 1 tick. Getting hit by the torrent refreshes the buff.

⬥ **Ranged Attack** - Pthentraken spins, sending a rock flying towards the player which deals up to 3500 ranged damage.

.
> **__General Strategy__**
.tag:strategy
**__Orikalka__**
⬥ Orikalka should be killed using 2-3 Entangles <:ent:567727987274022924> (to avoid frostbite) and fire spells <:FireSurge:543465116092334083>.

⬥ 4TAA is recommended to increase DPS and weave in <:ent:567727987274022924> (and Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> if not using <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>).

⬥ Start the kill with a Guthix Staff spec <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> if having low accuracy.

.
⬥ Prioritise bleeds <:comb:535533833098100745>/<:corruptblast:513190159194259467> until first <:ent:567727987274022924> lands. Immediately build to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> .
    • Use a wand and a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> with Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> to <:ent:567727987274022924> and <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>.
        - A defender is recommended for the accuracy boost it provides.
        - Watching for a magic xp drop can assist in confirming <:ent:567727987274022924> has landed. 
    • Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> should be used almost whenever off cooldown to build when Orikalka is stunned/rooted.

⬥ Once Orikalka moves, use <:ent:567727987274022924> again and move to the other side of your <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid attacks.

.
⬥ If Orikalka is not dead when the second <:ent:567727987274022924> ends, kite her with stuns like Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, or do a 3rd <:ent:567727987274022924> depending on hp.

⬥ If you get frostbite, deflect melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> and do not kill orikalka. Wait until fissures spawn, and then run or Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to one.

.
Dealing with frostbite-https://youtu.be/zx-JstVzl0k
.
**__Pthentraken__**
⬥ Prayer flicking every auto attack is strongly recommended as she hits the hardest of the three, especially the ranged attack.

⬥ If not using insulation boots, move to avoid converging lighting to edge tiles of Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>. Stay here to place the overcharge torrent and then return to the middle.

⬥ When the next converging lighting begins, run to the other side of <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>.

.
⬥ If using insulation boots, simply turn on deflect mage <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> during converging lighting to take almost no damage. Flick to deflect missiles <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> after the lighting passes for the ranged attack.

⬥ Staying closer to this boss will make attacks land sooner.

.
**__Rathis__**
⬥ Avoiding first poison bombardment is recommended as you are likely under Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, and can get bursted if both projectiles land on you.

⬥ Stand on a poison pit to reduce the overheal if not confident in killing Rathis before poison absorption.

⬥ Antipoison potion effect and venomblood perk works to reduce poison damage, but irit incense sticks <:IritSticks:690987265371144202> *do not.*

.
> **__Introduction to Hybrid Strategies__**
.tag:presets
In general, use weapons which exploit the weaknesses of the matriarchs that are at least **T90** in accuracy.
If not owning weapons to hit on their respective weakness(e.g. Do not own a T90+ bow) or weapons are low tier, ensure that you’re on task/zerker aura/highest accuracy aura for that style.

*Note: Most of the presets listed focus on high level hybriding which can easily yield more than 70 kph. Due to the number of combinations available, intermediate presets are not provided.*

.
**__Alternatives to Listed Strategies__**
⬥ If blessed flask <:blessedflask:659122178704408598> is not owned, presets should be made for 30 minute combat instead of camping the instance.
⬥ 4 restore flasks <:restore:642708657825644554> are recommended in such a preset.
⬥ Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> and kwuarm incense sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> can be included in a bonfire preset instead to make more inventory space.
⬥ Perked hybrid armour such as Sliske’s anima body and legs <:SliskeBody:513204700980576266> <:AnimalegsSliske:556592073042821122> can be taken instead, although this will reduce kph.

**__Strategy__**
⬥ Aim to end Orikalka kills with 100% adrenaline.

⬥ Execute a <:zerk:535532854004678657> <:gbarge:535532879250456578> rotation on Rathis to ensure she is killed before poison absorption. 

⬥ Adren pot <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> and limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> should be used in alternation with gBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to guarantee burst on Rathis.

⬥ You may use Terrasaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> to apply the first hit of Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> with ingenuity <:ingen:641339234111848463> and switch to main stab weapons. Otherwise, <:ingen:641339234111848463> should be used on the second <:ent:567727987274022924> under sun <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> to avoid splashes.

⬥ If ending Orikalka not with 100% adren, use basics and defensives from a distance targetting Rathis to gain adrenaline.

Camp SS <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>. If using lower tiered armor or otherwise notice that you constantly require food, vamp aura <:vamp:643505653079343144> should be taken along with 10 super restore flasks <:restore:642708657825644554> and holy wrench to upkeep prayer.

Use deflect melee <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> to avoid getting bursted by unlucky fissure spawns. Even through prayer and death ward, fissures can still kill if unlucky.
