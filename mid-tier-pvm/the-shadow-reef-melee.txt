**__Room 1__**
GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> the eastern crassian scout and bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on it. Move to the spot two squares north of the other scout and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, hitting all four enemies. Finish off with Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>. 

.
**__Room 2__**
Use GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> on the scouts, hitting as much scuttlers and scouts as possible. Finish with Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.

.
**__Room 3__**
 Move to the center of the cluster and Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>. Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> should finish the job afterwards

.
As the 😂 first 🥇😊 boss 💼👨 of 👏😍 The 👏 Shadow 👤👤 Reef, The 😱 Crassian Leviathan has ✅✅ a very small 😞 and 🎅 easy ‼⁉ set 😠 of 🗜💦 area denial mechanics 💰💰 that 🏼💀 can deal a lot of damage ☠☄ if 🏃👏 ignored. 😒😒 The 👏 boss 👨 will 👏 also ☹➕ passively heal over the duration of 💦 the 🤔 fight, ✊🏾 although the 👏 amount is 🏾🤔 very ☣ negligible. Once 💯🔂 you 👦❌ get used 🎶🆒 to 😩 the mechanics however, 🖐 this 👈🔥 fight 💥😡 should 💘💦 be 👬🐝 extremely 👌 consistent and 👅💰 fast. 🚄

.
__**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Poison 🤒 Pits + Additional heads:** The ⌛🚪 center of 👏👏 the ☸ arena is filled 🔋😩 with 👏🏽 poison 🤒 and 🏞 is 🤔☝ surrounded by 😈 the 🏼 additional heads of 🙏 the leviathan. This 👇 area deals constant 🔆 poison damage ☠☠ and 🎅 makes the 😩 player 🏋 vulnerable to 😥💦 long stun attacks that the 👏 heads can 💦🔫 use. The 👻 player should never 🚫 stand 💨 in 🅰👌 this ♂ zone ™™ during the 👏 fight, 👊😡 making 👧🛠 this mechanic largely irrelevant.

.
⬥ **Dragon 🐲🐉 Breath:** This will ⚽ always ❗ be 🅱 the first mechanic of the 👏 fight ✊😡 and ➕ is 💦 signaled by the 👅👏 Leviathan firing 🔫🔫 a stationary breath ♂💨 attack 🤼 in front of 💦🍌 it, 😍 dealing 🏾👦 rapid heavy damage. ☄☄ Simply 😡😡 stand 🕴 off 🤔 to the 😊 side ⏩⏩ to 😘 avoid 🙅 this. Afterwards, reposition in front 🔝🔝 of 💦 the 👏 boss 😂🏻 to 💰 avoid being 🔥 caught in 😩😎 the 🙏💬 next mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head 💯 Sweep:** The 💞👑 leviathan will slam its' head 😂 across ⛔👌 the 👀 ground twice, dealing 🚬🚬 very heavy damage ☠☠ to anyone 👦💼 caught 🐾 in 🏼👠 the 💜🌫 area. This is avoided by 👼 moving to 💰💦 the opposite 🔃♥ side of where 😾 the 😂🔯 sweep begins.

.
⬥ After going 🚕 through 🚪👉 one 😤😣 Dragon 🐲🐉 Breath 💨 and 👏🍳 two 🎄👬 sets of Head 😗👅 Sweeps, the 👏 Leviathan will shortly move 🏃 to 🌬💩 other opposite 💏🔃 side of 🚋👬 the 💯🏻 arena, repeating his previous rotation. 
    • Avoid entering the center here by Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> across the arena. 
    • Any 😱👏 bleed used 🚟 will 🔥⚽ be considered 🤔🤔 walked ♂ as 💰🤔 this ☝⬆ transition occurs. 

.
__**Strategy**__
For whatever reason, the Crassian Leviathan actually has decent defense so beware if not using Berserker <:berserker:643505116347105290>. Both strategies utilize channeled abilities and spamclicking the ground to stay on 2 specific "safe tiles" on either side of Crass's head during the Dragon Breath and Head Sweep mechanics.  If used correctly, you do not need a scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> to melee this boss.

.
⬥ **Standard 1 💪🤢 Cycle**
Your target is to pop Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> during the fight to finish him.

<:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → bleed <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit)

.
⬥ **2 👱 Zerk 1 ♂👀 Cycle**
Slower but potentially more consistent than the standard rotation -- your objective is to use gFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> to reduce the cooldown of Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, allowing for 2 <:zerk:535532854004678657>s in the roughly 1:10 time frame. This rotation does not work if you do not have Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179>.

<:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → bleed <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit)

<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → 188 → <:limitless:641339233638023179> bleed <:assault:535532855191928842> → 2 188s (1 if impatient proc) → <:destroy:535532879330148352>/<:cane:535532878969438210> depending on HP

*Note: With this rotation, you are looking to <:zerk:535532854004678657> the second time as soon as it comes off cooldown.*

There is a Cloaked Zealot and various Scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> one of the scouts for both the Barge buff and faster movement. 

Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on the zealot, then immediately target a Scuttler to Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>.

**__Room 11__**
Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons.

.
This ⏪🌎 encounter is the second ✌✌ boss 👨 of 🤔📆 the 🙀👉 Shadow 👤👤 Reef, and 💰🎅 is 😩🌈 a 🐀 clear 🔎 step ⬅👉 up ☝⬆ in difficulty 😤 from the 👏 first. 🥇 He 👨😽 and 😵 his 💦👇 Corpses are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet, Undead Slayer perk and 😦 sigil purposes.
.
> __**Mechanics**__
⬥ **Rift of 😳 Undeath** - A 👌 Rift of 😫 Undeath with 😂 30K HP. This rift will spawn a 👌 large 😵🏯 amount of 😫 skeletons 💀 that each 👏👋 deal low 🔽 amounts of damage. ☠ After 🔜 roughly 30 🚹✈ seconds, it 😫📝 will 😡 explode, 💥💥 dealing 👦👦 heavy ✴🍑 damage to the 📈 player. 🏋🤺 Should 💘 be 🐝🤔 killed 🔫 before ⬅🔙 it detonates.

.
⬥ **Death's Swiftness:** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and ♀👏 Bloated Monstrosity:** - Upon 💰 reaching 👉👉 200K hitpoints, Taraket will 🏼👙 become 🏽 invulnerable and 👽⚡ fly 🕊 towards ⛪⛪ one of 💦💦 the two 🎄✌ black 🏴 crystals at 🍆👌 the 😬😩 sides of 💦 the 👧 arena, healing himself and 👑🙌 spawning one ☝🔝 of 💦😰 the two 💏💏 corpses: Corpse ⚰⚰ Carrier (west) or 💯💦 the 👏 Bloated Monstrosity (east), 👉 with 👏 90K HP each. 
    • The 👗😮 Corpse ⚰⚰ Carrier will 👏🍡 continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's 😑🅱 alive ☠
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases 📊⤴ the ☝🍆 damage ☄☄ of 👏💦 Taraket's attacks. Both 🌜 of these 🍔🚑 attack ⚔⚔ with ⛹😍 melee and 👏✋ are 🙏👄 very easy ❓⁉ to 👮 kite if needed. 🤒 
    • Taraket can ♂ only spawn these ❌👈 once 😩😩 each 👏👏 and 🔛 will 😮❓ not 🚫 heal upon 🙀 hitting 😦 200K HP afterwards. 
    • The 😨🌎 first spawn will always 🤔💯 be the closest crystal 💎 to 🌋🍆 Taraket

.
⬥ **Spirit 🤗 Line:** 🙋🙋 - Taraket summons a line 🙋 of 👯 spirits from 🙃 a random direction that 😔 will move towards ⛪⛪ the 🗣 player, 💰🤷 dealing 🚬👦 rapid typeless damage ☠ upon 👤 contact. This ⬆👈 is accompanied by a very strong melee hit to 🏼👏 anyone ♀👨 standing 🔪 directly ➡➡ in 🍑👇 front ✋ of him. 🦊🏼 
    • Simply move out 💦 of the way accordingly when this ⬆👈 happens and don't stay 😤 in 🔝👏 front of 😰💦 the boss after 🏃😩 the 👧👏 two 💏 crystals have ✅ been 🏼🤤 spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
There 👬 are 🔢👏 three different 😡😡 methods to 🎊💰 this: 👏 Killing 🔪🔪 both 👬👦 bloats for 👏😏 maximum safety, killing 🔪🔪 only 😫 the Corpse ⚰ carrier immediately 🤣 to 🔥 balance safety with 😍 speed, ⏩ and 🚟 just 👌👌 DPSing Taraket and 🅱 tanking both bloats. What 😲 you 👼 do will 📃 slightly affect your 💦 rotation, but the overall goals remain 🔕 the 👭 same. ♂👬

.
⬥ **Opener**
    • Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> to GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>. and don't use Adrenaline Potions immediately as you’d want to save it for later. Instead, just use <:limitless:641339233638023179> to get your thresholds off. 
        - If you were quick and started the fight while you still have your Meteor Strike buff from the previous room, the amount of adrenaline you will gain from critical hits will let you go bleed Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> →  <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit) → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for the most optimal DPS rotation without an adrenaline potion. 
    • Dump the 🏿 rest of 💦 your 👆👆 strong 🏻 basics and ➕➡ the portal should 👌😀 spawn right before 🍑 Taraket phases. 
        - Activate Undead Slayer 🍆 right when 💕🍑 you 😩 use your next ☃☃ ability 👉👉 after 👀😡 Assault.

.
**__Safety V Speed__**
⬥ ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> on Taraket (the best way)
    • GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> as soon as he’s available to be hit with dual wield 
    • Swap to ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> to spec  
    • Swap to your Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> to get a lossless 2h auto for high damage. 
    • Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, saving Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> right before the 200k mark.

.
⬥ Killing the 👏💦 Corpse Carrier instantly, 💯💯 (slower, but much 💯😩 safer)

    • Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> to Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> as more skeletons spawn from the corpse carrier for maximum adrenaline refunds. 
    • Right after it’s dead, use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + Adren Pot  <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> → bleed Thresholds and finish Taraket off. 
    • Use ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> spec after your Berserk wears. Activate your Undead Slayer <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> under Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>

.
⬥ Ignoring the Corpse ⚰⚰ Carrier (Riskier ❌ and 🚟💰 much 💯😩 faster)
    • Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> immediately when Taraket can be damaged again and simply outeat everything. 
    • This is 😂 extremely risky, but can be 👬 done 😘 fairly well 🚰 even ✖🌃 with 🆕🆕 blubbers and 🌬 Guthix 💚 rests. 💤💤 
    • As your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> spec will still be on cooldown, finish off the rest of the kill with strong Basics and Thresholds.

**__Room 5__**
There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Very straightforward, just DPS as seen fit. Sea Witches have extremely delayed attacks for some reason so you may still take a moderate mage hit several seconds after it has died. Don't use Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> because you’ll want to save it for the next room.

.
**__Room 6__**
Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> and GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> the Kal’gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. 

You can 👌💰 manipulate one of 💦🐲 the 😍 required 📋✅ necromancers in room 7 ⏰💯 to 💦 move 🏃🏃 from his position 😫 to make 📝 the next room 😭 easier 😀 on 😩 you ⚠ by 🏼 running as 🏼😅 close as 👦 you 👧♀ can 😡 to 🏼👂 him, 👰😝 so he aggros you through 🤢➡ the wall. ⌨ But this 🗑 isn’t 100% 💯 guaranteed, 🔖🔖 and 😇🗣 if you 😍 don’t get 🍆 it 💯😍 simply ⤵ skip it and 👏 proceed. 🚶

**__Room 7__**

.
**__Room 8__**
Another 🏗 two Necromancers are ❓🏼 guarding the 🦉🍆 gate 🚧🚧 here 🤙⬇ so 😘 just continue 🏃💰 picking 🏻👋 them 😣 off. 🖕 The Sea 🌊 Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east 👉🌍 side 🤷⏩ of 🌈 the 🅿 room 🏚 have a fairly large 🏯 aggro range so 😖💯 preferably hug the 💜 wall ⌨⌨ as 👦 you enter. 

Use Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> the first Necromancer immediately. Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> at the exact same time to finish it off and move yourself quickly through the dungeon.

Two Warped Skeletons in here that can 💦 completely 😣😍 clear you if 👌👏 you 👧👈 aren't paying attention. 💯🗣 The 👥⏪ skeletons can 🔫👍 deal a 👌🏿 moderate mage hit 😎🎵 frequently, ☣ healing themselves 👧👨 while 👶💯 dealing 🏾🏾 2000-3000 😮 damage to 👪😘 you, 💸👨 be 👶🍆 careful. 😨🙋

GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the Crassian Scouts and finish off the rest of the mobs, but try not to use Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> so you can more quickly use it for the start of Ambassador if you don’t want to wait.

At 🍆 the 👏🙅 bottom 👇⬇ of 👱🔝 the 👏🚑 abyssal section 📦 awaits the 🏙💋 Ambassador, the final 🔮 boss of 💀 the 🔴🤤 Elite 👏 Dungeon ⛓😈 3. This boss has ✅ a moderate learning 🤗 curve 📊 compared to 💦 most 🐶 solo 👆😂 bosses and 😏 has 👏 a 👏👓 variety 🥑 of 💀💰 mechanics ranging from 🏼💥 DPS checks, 📚 area denial, and self-healing, 🤗😽 as 🅰 well as utilizing multiple combat 🗡🕰 styles. 

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

**__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple ☂ Corruption (Smoke)**
    • The 👏👶 Ambassador fires a spout 🍆 into 😩👉 the 🤔 player, ♀ dealing 🚬 no ❌ damage and 💯 placing a 👅🚟 bar 😫🥃 over their ☝⬅ head. 
    • When this bar 😫🥃 nears depletion, a 5x5 area around 🔃🔃 the player will become 🏽🏽 corrupted until 🅱⏰ the 👈🏿 boss 💼 reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 
    • This is 🤔 similar 💯👱 to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will 🤔😠 create 📲📲 two areas instead, 🔖🤷 separated by 🎨👨 2 🏻👱 ticks. 
        - These 🔫👈 zones will 🤔🐼 last 😳🕖 until 🕛 the 💰 final phase of the 💰 fight 💥 and 🍆 deal rapid 2000 😮😨 damage ☄☠ to 😅🥇 anyone 🏫 standing 🔪🏿 inside. 👩

    • Despawned by 😈💕 stunning it.

.
⬥ **Sinister Fragments (Spinners)** 🎗
    • Six fragments will 🅱😮 disperse from 💦👈 the 👏 boss 🏽☝ to 💰 the 🍆👉 edges of 💦 the arena with 👏 20K HP each. 👏👏 At 🌛 the 💦🗯 same 👬 time, 👌👌 the Ambassador will fire 🔥 three slowly ⏳ rotating beams that 🗳🏻 last for about 💦 a 🐝❌ minute. ⌚⏰ The beams always ⌛💯 spawn in 🔥🔽 set ⚔👌 locations 🌍 (N, 💰 SE, SW), and 🔛👏 rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use 👏👏 the Fragments one minute ⏰ into the 👏🅱 fight **OR** hitting 😦😦 the 💬 650K cap. The ❤🚀 next ➡📆 phase is at 550K.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**

**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Seiryu will spawn shortly after 💯 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.

⬥ A 👌👅 ring 💍 of black hands will spawn to encompass the 💬👌 edge 🔝 of the arena. The 👮 Ambassador will stop 🚫👮 doing his corruption and 😤 black 🏿🏿 hole mechanics and continue 💰💰 his 🏻🤴 auto 🤖 attack pattern as 🍑👏 normal. 🖖🖖

**__General Tips__**
⬥ Use a Ripper demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> with scrolls and drink Spiritual Prayers <:spiritualprayer:651079281882955787>.

⬥ Berserker Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> is ideal. Otherwise Mahjarrat Aura <:mahj:643148943856762890> is also ok.

⬥ If you have TMW <:tmwbody:643847118196441088>, try to avoid using solid food. Stick to Blue jellies <:blueblubber:689530593742291033>, Guthix rest <:grest:689530593901412578>, and Saradomin brews <:Brew:565726489400573962>.

⬥ Try to maximize the potential healing from soulsplitting <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> Spinners and the Seiryu Heal at 400k to cut down on food usage throughout the fight.

.
**__Phase 1 - 1M-650k HP__**
Your 👉👉 main goal ⬆💕 P1 is 😯💦 to 👏💦 maximize your 👏 time 🙈⏱ spent in melee distance doing damage ☄☄ to Ambassador.
⬥ Start the fight with an Apot Berserk rotation <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> <:zerk:535532854004678657>.
<:zerk:535532854004678657> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → bleed <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit)

.
⬥ **Mage 1st ❌ Auto 🤖 vs Melee 1st ❌❌ Auto**
    • Doing <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:bd:535532854281764884> (during gcd) → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> will switch the 1st auto into a melee auto.
    • Changing the 🏼 1st ❌ auto 🤖🤖 into 👉🚟 a melee auto 🤖🤖 changes 💰💰 the timing of the 1st smoke. 🚬🚬
        - Mage 1st auto leads to 💰 a 22.8s (38t) 1st smoke drop. 👇🚮
        - Melee 1st auto 🤖 leads to ⚠ a 💰✋ 31.8s 📅 (52t) 1st ❌❌ smoke 🚬 drop.
    • No other timings are 🏃🔢 changed.

*Note: The rotation in this guide assumes Mage 1st auto for timings.*

.
⬥ **1st ❌ Smoke** 🌫
<:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → place smoke

    • Place ❤ the 👏 1st ❌ smoke 🚬 in 👮👏 melee distance northeast of Ambassador.
        - If 👏 north ☝ is ⚠ 12 😎😎 on 🔛😠 a 🅱 clock, you 👆 want 🙀👏 to 👁 place 😻🤤 the 1st smoke at 2. 😍😩
        - If looking to utilize walk under flank <:flank4:712073088296157185>, you should place this smoke 1 square out of md to keep underneath free of smoke.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/p4pEpno.png
.
    • After placing the smoke, run through Ambassador and Zgs <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>.

*Note: Placing this smoke far is an option; however, it is only recommended if you are not confident in your ability to avoid a 2nd set of Spinners.*

.
⬥ **Black 🏴◼ Hole** 🕳⛳
<:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:bd:535532854281764884> black hole → <:backhand:535532854302605333> clear back hole → <:bd:535532854281764884> back to Ambassador → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-3 hit)

    • The recommended strategy for clearing the back hole is to Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> on gcd to the back hole, clear it with Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>, then <:bd:535532854281764884> on gcd again back to Ambassador.
    • Alternatively, the black hole can be tanked with Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> for a source of damage, especially in TMW <:tmwbody:643847118196441088>.
        - Tanking with <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> is not recommended as the adren is generally better spent on other thresholds.

.
⬥ **2nd Smoke** 🚬🚫
    • This 👈 smoke should 💘👌 be placed far. 🌐
        - Ideally place this smoke with Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> to maximize DPS time.
    • Feel free to run back to Ambassador after placing if you have not phased, but *Do Not* use gBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> and ideally do not use Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>/Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.

.
**__Phase 2 - Spinners__**
Ideally, Bladed Dive should be used to travel between spinners as killing a spinner will reset Bladed Dive cooldown. You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to block the explosion hit.

.
⬥ **Basic 🌑😚 but 🍑🍑 Solid Spinner Strategy** (not 🕵 all basics listed)
    • 1st: <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → bleed <:destroy:535532879330148352>
    • 2nd: <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-3 hit) → 188s
    • 3rd: <:assault:535532855191928842>
    • 4th: lunge <:dismember:535532879376023572> → <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> → 188s
        - Alternatively can <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → <:stomp:535532879552315412> → 188s
    • 5th: <:destroy:535532879330148352>
    • 6th: <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-3 hit) → 188s

.
⬥ **Advanced ⚛ Spinner 👏👏 Strategy**
    • To min-max damage against Ambassador, use Dragon battleaxe <:DBA:603979368850653216> <:spec:537340400273195028> after a Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> + 188% ability on the third fragment. 
    • Once you get back to 100% adrenaline, use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> and build back to 100% adrenaline.
    • Keep in mind that 😟👏 during 🚣 this time, ⌚ you 👊⚠ can 💦🔫 essentially only 🕦 use basics so destroying 🚧 all 😫 of ❗💦 the fragments is 😲 made much 🙀 harder. 😫😫

.
**__Phase 3 - 650k-400k__**
⬥ After Spinners, do a Limitless Berserk rotation <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:zerk:535532854004678657>.
<:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → 2 188s → <:limitless:641339233638023179> bleed <:assault:535532855191928842> → 1 188 → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2 hit) → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → 3rd smoke

*Note: Rotation requires the Fury of the Small relic <:furyofthesmall:697808773917573233>.*

    • 5/6 😂 spinners killed
        - If choosing to <:disrupt:535614336207552523> the explosion, go ahead and <:zerk:535532854004678657> right away then <:disrupt:535614336207552523> at the correct time.
        - If choosing to <:res:535541258844635148> the explosion, delay your <:zerk:535532854004678657> until after blocking the explosion.
    • Apot Berserk vs Limitless Berserk
        - If you phase P1 early (reaching 650k before 1 min), you will not have Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> off cooldown for this <:zerk:535532854004678657>.
        - For players who have trouble skipping the 2nd set of Spinners, it is recommended to do an <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> <:zerk:535532854004678657> rotation here.
        - Players who do not have trouble with this skip can still opt for an <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> <:zerk:535532854004678657> here; however, with future improvement in mind, it is recommended to instead learn and utilize a <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:zerk:535532854004678657> here as you will not need to change your rotation later.

    • Place the 💰📩 3rd 👀 smoke 🚬🚬 in melee distance southeast of 💦 Ambassador.
        - Move ♂♂ up close 😍😍 to 🏻💦 the 💩 smoke 🚬🚬 you already ✔🙏 placed while 🏻♀ remaining 🕵🕵 in 🔱 md to place. 🏡🤤

.

.
    • *Do Not* attempt to walk under flank <:flank4:712073088296157185> after placing this smoke as underneath will likely not be safe until later.
    • After placing the smoke, run to the west and Zgs <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>.
    • Ritual keepers should spawn very quickly. Ignore them. 😉🎸

⬥ **Black 🏿🏿 Hole**
<:bd:535532854281764884> black hole → <:backhand:535532854302605333> clear back hole → <:bd:535532854281764884> back to Ambassador → <:assault:535532855191928842> → <:destroy:535532879330148352> → <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (2-3 hit) → <:dismember:535532879376023572>

    • The recommended strategy for clearing the back hole is to Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> on gcd to the back hole, clear it with Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333>, then <:bd:535532854281764884> on gcd again back to Ambassador.
    • Alternatively, the black hole can be tanked with Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> for a source of damage, especially in TMW <:tmwbody:643847118196441088>.
        - Tanking with <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> is not recommended as the adren is generally better spent on other thresholds.

*Note: Your <:assault:535532855191928842> timing here is very important to the overall speed of your kill as it will dictate when you can <:zerk:535532854004678657> next then when you can <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> after.*

.
⬥ **4th Smoke** 🚬🚬
    • Depending on gear/aura/experience/DPS, some ⏳ players will 🤗⚽ get 🥈🉐 this 👇 whereas others 🚫 will 💦 skip.
    • If you do not skip it, place it far ideally with Escape <:escape:535541258832052231>.

    • Block 🚫🤖 the 👏👏 healing smoke 🚬🚬
        - Understand your character 🙉💀 as 😐 a 👌 wedge when blocking ⛔⛔ smoke. 🚬🚬 You 👨 can always 🕔😤 block 🍆🤖 2 smoke 🚬🚬 directions ⬆ at 🍆😔 once 💯 so 🆗 whenever you 👈👈 have 👏 to move, ♀🏃 rather 🙇☑ than 🔪👉 moving to ➡ block 😛🚫 the 💰👭 current 🤕 smoke, move 🏃 to block the 👏😫 current smoke *and the next smoke*. 🌫
        - Alternatively you can spam 🔁 click 🖱🖱 under him 😓😝 to block 🍆 all 😋 of the healing smoke 🚬 without 🚫👏 needing to ⬆🤣 move, though this is 💦💰 also ➕😨 the most click-intensive 🖱🖱 and 〰 difficult thing 😤 you 🙏😘 can 💦 do. 👌
