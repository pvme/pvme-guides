GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> the eastern crassian scout and bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on it. Move to the spot two squares north of the other scout and Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, hitting all four enemies.

Use GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> on the scouts, hitting as much scuttlers and scouts as possible. Finish with Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.

**__Room 3:__**
 Move to the center of the cluster and Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439>. Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> should finish the job afterwards

.
**Example:** <https://youtu.be/bETOKmCEv6I>

**__Room 4:__**  
Use Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> on the Zealots to kill them.

**__Room 5:__** 
There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here.  

Line up your Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> to hit everything in one go. You only need to kill the two Scouts and Zealots to move to the next room.

.
**Example:** <https://youtu.be/VYA1tj-7dqg>

**__Room 6:__** 
⬥ Hit the first group with Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> then keep running past while putting on your salve amulet. 
⬥ Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> the second group, then run back to the middle to lure both groups of zombies next to you. 
⬥ Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> and finish off the rest with Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> (with Laceration boots) and GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>. 
    • If you have it available, Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> is good but you likely won’t have it back in time.

.
> __**The Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://i.imgur.com/uLxEnlg.png
.
As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast.

__**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Poison pits + Additional heads:** The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant.

⬥ **Dragon Breath:** This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the Leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head Sweep:** The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins.

⬥ After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the Leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena, repeating his previous rotation. 
    • Avoid entering the center here by Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> across the arena. 
    • Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. 

.
__**Strategy**__
Your target is to pop Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> during the fight. Within your Berserk, bleed Assault <:assault:535532855191928842>, fully channel Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, and GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit) . 

Within ZGS, get at least a fully channeled Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> and Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> off. Don’t bother with a second Berserk, aim to just finish him off in one cycle.

.
**__Room 9:__** 
There is a Cloaked Zealot and various Scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. You can generally stand behind the Zealot and the Scuttlers will MD you for AoEs. 

GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> one of the scouts for both the Barge buff and faster movement. Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on the zealot, then immediately target a Scuttler to Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>.

**__Room 10:__**  
Wait for them to MD you and use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> and a few AoEs. 

.
**__Room 11:__** 
Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. There's not much to this room but focusing the necromancer will clear the skeletons in the AoE available. Save the following abilities for next Room: Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>

**__Room 12:__** 
Kill one of the Necromancers with a walked Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> → Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986>. Then quickly move to the zombies guarding the entrance to the temple itself. Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> the zombies, then finish off with good basics.

.
**__Room 1:__** 
Go to either necromancer and GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> (with Mobile) → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>. Kill that necromancer and activate the artifact, then go to the other necromancer and GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> (with Mobile again) → GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, then activate the artifact.

**__Room 2:__** 
⬥ Use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> right as you start moving into the bridge and Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the end immediately mid-GCD, 
⬥ GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> one of the sea horrors. 
⬥ Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on it, then target the necromancer to Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>.
⬥ Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> the horror you **didn’t** attack to kill both the first horror and the necromancer. 
⬥ Finish off the horror with other strong basics to proceed.

.
A lot of learners panic eat a ton here but the bridge can be done with no food

**Example:** <https://youtu.be/I_4wbqXoZaw>

.
**__Room 3:__** 
There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. They are melee and line up well for AoEs.

**__Room 4:__** 
Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes and go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. 

Start with a Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> and finish off all the mobs with other AoE abilities, but make sure to have high adrenaline as the next room is the second boss, Taraket the Necromancer.

.
> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. He and his Corpses are classified as Undead for Salve Amulet, Undead Slayer perk and sigil purposes.
.
> __**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Rift of Undeath** 
    • A Rift of Undeath with 30K HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing heavy damage to the player. Should be killed before it detonates.

⬥ **Death's Swiftness:** 
    • Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity:** Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. 

    • The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. 

Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. 

The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket

⬥ **Spirit Line:** 
    • Taraket summons a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. 

Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
There are three different methods to this: Killing both bloats for maximum safety, killing only the Corpse carrier immediately to balance safety with speed, and just DPSing Taraket and tanking both bloats. What you do will slightly affect your rotation, but the overall goals remain the same.

⬥ No matter how you do the fight, start with <:zerk:535532854004678657> to <:gbarge:535532879250456578>. **Don't** use Adrenaline Potions immediately as you’d want to save it for later. Instead, just use <:limitless:641339233638023179> to get your thresholds off. 
    • If you were quick and started the fight while you still have your Meteor Strike buff from the previous room, the amount of adrenaline you will gain from critical hits will let you go bleed Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> →  <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (3 hit) → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> for the most optimal DPS rotation without an adrenaline potion. 
    • Dump the rest of your strong basics and the portal should spawn right before Taraket phases. 
        - Activate Undead Slayer right when you use your next ability after Assault.

.
⬥ Destroy the portal immediately. Abilities like Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> are fantastic for this purpose. After that you have different ways of continuing the fight:

    • ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> on Taraket (the best way)
        - GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> as soon as he’s available to be hit with dual wield 
        - Swap to ZGS<:zgs:626465964325601290> to spec  
        - Swap to your Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> to get a lossless 2h auto for high damage. 
        - Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, saving Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> right before the 200k mark.

    • Killing the Corpse Carrier instantly, (slower, but much safer)
        - GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → GFlurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> 
        - Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> to Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> as more skeletons spawn from the corpse carrier for maximum adrenaline refunds. 
        - Then right after it’s dead, use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> + Adren Pot  <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> → bleed Thresholds and finish Taraket off. 
        - Use <:zgs:626465964325601290> spec after your Berserk wears. Activate your Undead Slayer <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> under Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>

.
    • Ignoring the Corpse Carrier (Riskier and much faster)
        - Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> immediately when Taraket can be damaged again and simply outeat everything. 
        - This is extremely risky, but can be done fairly well even with blubbers and Guthix rests. 
        - As your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> spec will still be on cooldown, finish off the rest of the kill with strong Basics and Thresholds.

.
**__Room 5:__** 
There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Very straightforward, just DPS as seen fit. Sea Witches have extremely delayed attacks for some reason so you may still take a moderate mage hit several seconds after it has died. Don't use Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> because you’ll want to save it for the next room.

**__Room 6:__** 
Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> and GBarge <:barge:535532853916860437> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> the Kal’gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. 

You can manipulate one of the required necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. But this isn’t 100% guaranteed, and if you don’t get it simply skip it and proceed.

.
**__Room 7:__** 
There's two Necromancers hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Dump some thresholds and proceed.

**__Room 8:__** 
Another two Necromancers are guarding the gate here so just continue picking them off. The Sea Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east side of the room have a fairly large aggro range so preferably hug the wall as you enter. 

Use Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> the first Necromancer immediately. Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> at the exact same time to finish it off and move yourself quickly through the dungeon. Get on the other necromancer and finish it off with strong abilities. Finally, dive into the abyss to enter the final section of the dungeon.

**__Room 1:__** 
Move to the gate and GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> a Crassian warrior. Bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> on it, and let the rest of the warriors gather to you, then finish them off with AoE's. Save Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> for Room 3.

**__Room 2:__** 
Two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. The skeletons can deal a moderate mage hit frequently, healing themselves while dealing 2000-3000 damage to you, be careful.

.
**__Room 3:__** 
Use Meteor Strike <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> and AoE the enemies all in one go and finish off the rest of the mobs however you see fit.

**__Room 4:__** 
The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. They're pretty spread out so just dps and make sure to be on high adrenaline for the encounter with The Ambassador. 

There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surging <:surge:535533810004262912>. GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> the Crassian Scouts and finish off the rest of the mobs, but try not to use Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> so you can more quickly use it for the start of Ambassador if you don’t want to wait.

.
> __**Kranon, the Ambassador**__
.tag:Ambassador
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0CrSo5E.png
.
At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. 

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Mechanics**__

**__1M-550K HP__**
**Purple Corruption:** 
⬥ The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. 
    • When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 

⬥ This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. 
    • These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside.

**Black Hole:** 
⬥ The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player
    • Despawned by stunning it.

**Sinister Fragments:** 
⬥ Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight **OR** hitting the 650K cap. The next phase is at 550K.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**	
⬥ Upon hitting 550K HP, the Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. 

.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Seiryu will spawn shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.

⬥ A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. 

⬥ The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player.  

.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught** 
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.

__**Ambassador's attack rotation**__
⬥ **1M HP to 550K - Phase 1**
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat 

⬥ **550K to 400K - Phase 2**
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.

⬥ **Ritual - Kill**
    • 5 autos → Melee/Magic → 5 autos → Melee/Magic → Onslaught

.
__**Strategy**__

⬥ Start the fight with a Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> rotation. 
    • By the time you finish, the Ambassador should have laid down his first purple corruption.  
        - If you’re not confident in your DPS, you can simply Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> away to place it somewhere else, then GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> back to ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> spec to bleed Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>. 
        - If you’re feeling good about your DPS, you can simply place it right next to the Ambassador and run through him to keep DPSing. Either way, lay down your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> and dump Thresholds.

⬥ For the black hole, you can choose to either go over to stun, or tank it with Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912>. 
    • With TMW <:tmwbody:643847118196441088>, tanking it and using it as recoil is a very nice source of damage. 

⬥ Do more damage with thresholds until the second corruption, placing it away from the Ambassador. 
    • If not, just place the corruption away then get back on Ambassador for a tiny bit before the sinister fragments spawn.    
    • If your DPS is good, you should phase either immediately after you get the second corruption or 1-2 autoattacks after. 

⬥ During fragments just use your strongest abilities. 
    • Use GBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> to bleed thresholds to wipe them out in essentially 2-3 abilities. 
    • Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> + Stomp <:stomp:535532879552315412> to wipe out fragments.

.
        - If you want to min-max damage against Ambassador, use Dragon battleaxe <:DBA:603979368850653216> after a Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> + 188% ability on the third fragment. 
        - Once you get back to 100% adrenaline, use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> and build back to 100% adrenaline. 
        - Not using this strategy simply means you'd use another Adrenaline Potion or use Limitless. Leaving them potentially on cooldown for Ritual.

⬥ By that point, the Ambassador should finish his spinning and be able to be damaged again with another Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> rotation. 
    • Keep in mind that during this time, you can essentially only use basics so destroying all of the fragments is made much harder. 
    • You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either <:res:535541258844635148> or <:disrupt:535614336207552523> to block the explosion hit.

⬥ Continue on and the ritual keepers should spawn very quickly within your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>. 

⬥ After it wears off, use your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> spec and continue to DPS through. 

⬥ When the third purple corruption appears, stand in one of the Ambassador’s corners to properly place the corruption and running back to your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> spec. 
    • If you get a black hole spawn, stun or <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> again.

.
⬥ Continue to lower the Ambassador’s LP down and get ready to use Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> again right as he begins the black hands phase. 

⬥ DPS him down and use ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> again, and he should be dead. 
    • Run around to block the healing smoke and place your ZGS <:zgs:626465964325601290> right under him so you can run while taking advantage of it. 
        - Alternatively you can continue to spam click under him to block all of the healing smoke without needing to move, though this is also the most click-intensive and difficult thing you can do.

⬥ When the Magic Onslaught appears, you can use Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> to block it, or use Reflect <:reflect:535541258786177064> and Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737> to reduce some damage.
