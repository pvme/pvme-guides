.tag:intro
The Twin Furies is a Zamorakian  boss located in the Heart of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering the boss fight requires 40 (or 20 kc if you have enough rep) and 80 (boostable) Ranged <:range:580168050121113623>. Notable drops include the Crest of Zamorak, which is an ingredient for making T80 and T85 power armor, and the T85 Fury Blades.

The boss itself is the easiest of the four GWD2 fights. The boss is unique in the fact that both targets share the 200k hp pool. This means that an aoe attack will essentially do double damage.

**__Advanced Melee Preset__**
⬥ A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> or Dragonrider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing **double** damage.
⬥ If you're struggling with food conservation and Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is not enough to heal you, you may also use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot.
⬥ An elite Enhanced Excalibur <:excal:641337999170207763> and Ancient Elven Ritual shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.
⬥ <:luckpotion:656426717295935500>  **Enhanced Luck Potion** - Gives tier 3 luck, can be removed if swapping to LotD <:LotD:566453486913323042>
⬥ <:adrenurn:656426717413507074>  **Adrenaline Urn** - Prevents adren loss after dropping combat, stores up to 1000% adrenaline
⬥ <:ancientshard:656426717505650708>  **Ancient Elven Ritual Shard** - Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown

*Note: Currently, Deathtouch Bracelet <:DTB:513190159429271562> is used as Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> are bugged at Twin Furies.*

.tag:mechanics
**__Jumps__**
Avaryss jumps towards the northern wall and charges down to the southern wall. She will repeat this attack a total of 4 times and will always travel in the cardinal directions (north to south, west to east, etc.). You may simply move out of the way after Avaryss jumps to a new wall.
.

.
Any single link of this mechanic can be dealt with by using Resonance for a free heal, but is not required to deal with the mechanic at all.

.
**__Ceiling Collapse__**
Nymora will jump to a random square in the arena and cause a ceiling collapse. You have to stand in the 3x3 area around her to negate the damage from the collapse.
.

.
*Note: Currently Nymora is bugged and will dissapear shortly after taking flight. Pay attention to where she goes and react appropiately.*

.
**__Channeled Bomb__**
The twins will jump to the center of the arena and channel a bomb attack. During this special, you will take ticks of typeless damage which can easily be negated with Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/N7ceSRh.mp4
.
If the channel finishes and the kill is not over, a bomb will detonate dealing 4,500 damage.
.

.
This bomb can be avoided by Surging to the edges of the arena or blocking it with defensives. During this phase, the twins take 2x damage and stand close enough that Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> will hit both of them.

**__Gp/hr__**
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C371$
*Note: Assumes Max Reputation and $data_pvme:Bosses!B371$ kph.*
.
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on constant healing. It is also important to use the **Animate Dead** spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage.
⬥ **NOTE:** Utilizing even one source of extra healing mitigates a LOT of the danger presented by this method so long as Trimmed Masterwork Armour <:tmwbody:536966366272552960> is being used. Do keep in mind though that the safest option by far is to use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>.
⬥ *Please note this setup/guide is VERY new and is subject to change in the near future.*

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how afk kills can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, but you must pay more attention to both your HP and your prayer points. This should be an effective aura for fast kills, but is technically the least afk choice.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows for the most afk experience, but is less safe to use. It is advised to pay attention to your HP with this aura, and to be prepared to eat in case your HP drops too low.
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing. This can mitigate the need for a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism and allows other pocket slot items to be used safely, such as a Zamorak God Book.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but does not offer anything else. It is a viable option as a secondary aura.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.

.
⬥ A Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> will be the most effective weapon for this setup due to its passive effect and accuracy. If you do not have one, other 2-handed melee weapons such as Superior Vesta's Spear <:vestaspear:852661743682846720> or Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> should be fine to use, but may be slightly slower.
.
**__Mandatory Requirements__**
⬥ This setup should reliably allow you to afk The Twin Furies with the duration between checking your status dependent on the aura you are using. However, the following needs to be done or else **__This method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners *may* result in failure:__**
    • Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> is **unlocked** and **active**
    • Trimmed Masterwork Armour <:tmwbody:536966366272552960> is **equipped** *+ See Side Notes*
    • Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is **active**
    • Turmoil <:turmoil:583429936606347280> or Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573> is **active**
    • A passive source of healing <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>/<:vamp:643505653079343144> is **active**
    • Elder Overload <:elderovlsalve:648976643687317532> is **active**
    • Ripper Demon <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> is **summoned**
    • Run is **on**
    • Auto-retaliate is **on**

.
**__Side Notes:__**
⬥ While this is an AFK method, The Twin Furies are a special case where repositioning has a positive impact on your kills. If you don't mind actively moving your character after looting, it is suggested to **move to the northeast corner between kills**. This makes kill times and safety significantly more consistent. However, danger is relatively low to begin with so this is entirely optional.
⬥ Trimmed Masterwork Armour <:tmwbody:536966366272552960> is listed as a mandatory requirement, but realistically The Twin Furies can be semi-AFK'd without it. **If you elect to *not* use Trimmed Masterwork Armour, __it is heavily advised to be monitoring your kills in case you are caught in Nymora's rain attack and to be using a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874>.__**  In the case of this happening, you should also switch to Deflect Range <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> and attack Avaryss or else you may die.

.
**__Preset__**
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage Relic** - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an **Adrenaline Urn** <:adrenurn:656426717413507074> with ocassional stalling.
⬥ **Ganodermic Gloves & Boots** - Magic tank armor is required for **Animate Dead** <:animatedead:856635090453135382> to reduce enough damage for this afk method. This is the cheapest and most effective option at this moment.
⬥ <:runepouch:583430011868938283> **Runes** - Runes are of course required to cast Animate Dead. The runes you should bring are: <:Soulrune:536252660333019136>, <:Bloodrune:536252658970001409>, <:Deathrune:536252659586433024>, <:Earthrune:536252659808731137>.
⬥ <:eof:787526151978614824> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and Soulsplit passive.
⬥ <:championring:839903943630520350> **Champion's Ring** - Extra critical chance helps speed up kills. If not owned, can be substituted for other strong rings such as Asylum Surgeon's <:asr:513190158472839208> or Ring of Death. <:RoD:513190159462825984>
