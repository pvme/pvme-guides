.tag:intro
The Twin Furies is a 👌 Zamorakian  boss 🏽☝ located in the 🐫⏪ Heart ❤😍 of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering 👻👻 the 🏳👏 boss fight 👿👊 requires 40 (or 🚨💁 20 🎉🎉 kc if you 👈👆 have 😝🤘 enough 💦🔛 rep) 🅾🅾 and 80 ranged. Notable drops include 😠😠 the 🎅 Crest of 💦💦 Zamorak, which 👏 is 👉😍 an 👹 ingredient 🍳🍳 for 🎅 making 👧💰 T80 and 🥜🙏 T85 power armor, ⛓⛓ and 👏 the 👏 T85 blades.
The 😬 boss itself 👏👈 is 😩💦 the 🌊 easiest of the 👏 four GWD2 fights. The 👏 boss 👨🏽 is 🐂 unique 👌 in 🙌🖕 the fact that 👊 both targets share 🤤 the 👏 200k hp pool. This 👈👇 means 🎺 that 👆 an aoe attack ⚔ will 🅱 essentially do 👏😂 double damage. ☄☠ That being said, 💦 melee with a halberd style weapon 🗡🗡 is 🔥 preferred. 📦📦

**__Advanced Melee Preset__**
A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> or Dragonrider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing double damage. If you're struggling with food conservation and soulsplit is not enough to heal you, you may also use a scrimshaw of vampyrism to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot. An elite enhanced excalibur and ancient elven ritual shard are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.
⬥ <:luckpotion:656426717295935500>  **Enhanced Luck Potion** - Gives tier 3 luck, can be removed if swapping to lotd

**__Jumps__**
Avaryss jumps towards ⛪⛪ the 👏👏 northern 🎅🎅 wall ⌨ and 🔛➡ charges down to the 👏 southern wall. She will repeat this 🌈 attack 🤼🤼 a total 😏💯 of 4 🕓👌 times 🕰🔥 and 💰💦 will 🙈✊ always 😍 travel ✈✈ in 📥 the cardinal directions 😵➡ (north to ♂ south, west to 💪💦 east, 🌍🌍 etc.). You ☝ may simply 😡 move 🏃♂ out of the 💰 way ➡💫 after 🅰👀 Avaryss jumps to 📖 a 📖🏿 new 💦🆕 wall. ⌨😜 Any 🈸 single 🚫👆 link 🔗🚨 of 🚑🏻 this mechanic can 🔫👍 be dealt with 🍨😂 by 👀 using 🏻📤 resonance for a 🏾😼 free 🏇🙋 heal, but is not 🌼🏼 required to deal with 🙀😲 the 🤓 mechanic at 🏾👏 all. 👨

.
**__Ceiling Collapse__**
Nymora will jump ♂ to 👮🌬 a 👌 random square in 👏😌 the 👨👏 arena and 🍆➡ cause 🔄 a ceiling collapse. 📉📉 You 😂 have to stand in 😂 the 🔥 3x3 area around 🔃🐋 her to ➡ negate the damage ☠☄ from the 👑 collapse. 📉

.
**__Channeled Bomb__**
The twins will 🅱 jump 🏃 to the center of 💦 the arena and 🎁👏 channel 👀 a bomb attack. ⚔🤼 During 🏃🚣 this ⤴ special, you ➕🙏 will take 😀 ticks of 💦😤 typeless damage which 🤤🏼 can 💦🔭 easily be negated with soulsplit. If the channel 😚 finishes and 🍒 the 👑🏻 kill is not over, a 📝💅 bomb will detonate dealing 🏾👦 4,500 🌈💦 damage. ☄☄ This 💯 bomb 💦💣 can ☺💦 be avoided by 😈 surging to 👁 the edges of the arena. During 🏃🏃 this 👇😞 phase, 🌗🌗 the 🚑🙌 twins take 2x damage and stand ⛱ close 🚫 enough 💦❌ that 👉😐 cleave, hurricane, and quake will 💰😜 hit 👊 both 🌜 of 🚀 them. 🛂
