.tag:intro
The Twin Furies is a Zamorakian  boss located in the Heart of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering the boss fight requires 40 (or 20 kc if you have enough rep) and 80 ranged. Notable drops include the Crest of Zamorak, which is an ingredient for making T80 and T85 power armor, and the T85 blades.
The boss itself is the easiest of the four GWD2 fights. The boss is unique in the fact that both targets share the 200k hp pool. This means that an aoe attack will essentially do double damage. That being said, melee with a halberd style weapon is preferred.

A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> or Dragonrider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing double damage. If you're struggling with food conservation and soulsplit is not enough to heal you, you may also use a scrimshaw of vampyrism to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot. An elite enhanced excalibur and ancient elven ritual shard are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.

**__Jumps__**
Avaryss jumps towards the northern wall and charges down to the southern wall. She will repeat this attack a total of 4 times and will always travel in the cardinal directions (north to south, west to east, etc.). You may simply move out of the way after Avaryss jumps to a new wall. Any single link of this mechanic can be dealt with by using resonance for a free heal, but is not required to deal with the mechanic at all.

.
**__Ceiling Collapse__**
Nymora will jump to a random square in the arena and cause a ceiling collapse. You have to stand in the 3x3 area around her to negate the damage from the collapse.

.
**__Channeled Bomb__**
The twins will jump to the center of the arena and channel a bomb attack. During this special, you will take ticks of typeless damage which can easily be negated with soulsplit. If the channel finishes and the kill is not over, a bomb will detonate dealing 4,500 damage. This bomb can be avoided by surging to the edges of the arena. During this phase, the twins take 2x damage and stand close enough that cleave, hurricane, and quake will hit both of them.
