.tag:intro
The Twin Furies is a Zamorakian  boss located in the Heart of Gielinor (aka GWD2). Entering the boss fight requires 40 (or 20 kc if you have enough rep) and 80 (boostable) Ranged <:range:580168050121113623>. Notable drops include the Crest of Zamorak, which is an ingredient for making T80 and T85 power armor, and the T85 Fury Blades.

The boss itself is the easiest of the four GWD2 fights. The boss is unique in the fact that both targets share the 200k hp pool. This means that an aoe attack will essentially do double damage.

**__Advanced Melee Preset__**
⬥ A halberd range weapon such as a Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> or Dragonrider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872> should be used because AoE melee abilities will hit both furies effectively doing **double** damage.
⬥ If you're struggling with food conservation and Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is not enough to heal you, you may also use a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> to help sustain yourself for the full hour. Otherwise, an unactivated god book can remain in your pocket slot.
⬥ An elite Enhanced Excalibur <:excal:641337999170207763> and Ancient Elven Ritual shard <:ancientshard:656426717505650708> are used to supplement your HP and prayer upkeep.

*Note: Currently, Deathtouch Bracelet <:DTB:513190159429271562> is used as Cinderbane Gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812> are bugged at Twin Furies.*

**__Jumps__**
Avaryss jumps towards the northern wall and charges down to the southern wall. She will repeat this attack a total of 4 times and will always travel in the cardinal directions (north to south, west to east, etc.). You may simply move out of the way after Avaryss jumps to a new wall.
.

.
Any single link of this mechanic can be dealt with by using Resonance for a free heal, but is not required to deal with the mechanic at all.

.
**__Ceiling Collapse__**
Nymora will jump to a random square in the arena and cause a ceiling collapse. You have to stand in the 3x3 area around her to negate the damage from the collapse.
.

.
*Note: Currently Nymora is bugged and will dissapear shortly after taking flight. Pay attention to where she goes and react appropiately.*

.
**__Channeled Bomb__**
The twins will jump to the center of the arena and channel a bomb attack. During this special, you will take ticks of typeless damage which can easily be negated with Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/N7ceSRh.mp4
.
If the channel finishes and the kill is not over, a bomb will detonate dealing 4,500 damage.
.

.
This bomb can be avoided by Surging to the edges of the arena or blocking it with defensives. During this phase, the twins take 2x damage and stand close enough that Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> will hit both of them.

**__Gp/hr__**
Total <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Bosses!C371$
*Note: Assumes Max Reputation and $data_pvme:Bosses!B371$ kph.*
**__Explanation__**
⬥ This method will net less kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. KPH can vary wildly depending on the weapon you use, not to mention the potential of running all over the boss arena and losing time to that.
⬥ It is important to pray <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> as this method relies on healing through the Twins' damage. It is also important to use the **Animate Dead** spell, as the method heavily relies on its usage to survive some attacks.
⬥ It is assumed that you will use a **Legendary Pet** for this setup. If you choose to forego auto-looting and bring a **Ripper Demon** <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714> instead, you can expect 2-3 more kills per hour.
⬥ Even if you have higher tier magic tank armor already perked, it is highly suggested to augment a piece of **Ganodermic Armor** with **Crystal Shield 4** <:crystalshield4:921410343606034443>. Putting the perk on Ganodermic prevents the need to reperk your main armor, and it is very strong in terms of aiding your survival while afking.
⬥ While this does allow for full 5 minute AFKing, sometimes your Legendary Pet will not follow you after Avaryss' charge attack. As such, you may be required to manually loot on some kills if this happens.

.
⬥ Aura choice can vary, but will affect how fast or consistent can be. They are listed in order of effectiveness:
    • <:dm:643505652571963417> Dark Magic provides extra damage, allowing for faster and more consistent kills. This is going to be your best aura choice, and KPH figures used in this section are based on the usage of this aura.
    • <:mahj:643148943856762890> Mahjarrat Aura provides extra damage, but is not able to be refreshed like Dark Magic.
    • <:vamp:643505653079343144> Vampyrism Aura provides extra safety through its healing, but nothing else of note.
    • <:berserker:643505116347105290> **Do __not__ use Berserker** for afking, as it will get you killed very easily.
    • <:penance:643505653062565907> Penance Aura allows a very afk experience, but is rendered obselete by Penance Powder. It is no longer worth using this aura.

.
⬥ Autocasting Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> with dual-wield magic weapons <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> will be most effective for this setup.
.
**__Mandatory Requirements__**
⬥ This setup should reliably allow you to afk the Twin Furies for 5 minutes at a time, even with a Legendary Pet. However, the following needs to be done or else **__This method will be either unreliable or will outright not work. Cutting corners *will* result in failure:__**
    • Igneous Kal-Mej <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> or Kal-Zuk <:igneouskalzuk:902209626479685734> is **equipped**
    • Crystal Shield perk <:crystalshield4:921410343606034443> is **equipped**
    • Animate Dead <:animatedead:856635090453135382> is **unlocked** and **active**
    • Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> is **unlocked**
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is **unlocked**
    • Soulsplit <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> is **active**

**__Preset__**
⬥ **Runes** - Runes required to cast Animate Dead and Exsanguinate <:Soulrune:536252660333019136>, <:Bloodrune:536252658970001409>, <:Deathrune:536252659586433024>, <:Earthrune:536252659808731137>, <:Firerune:536252659850674186>.
⬥ <:persistentrage:739965637056659567> **Persistent Rage Relic** - Prevents adrenaline from draining while out of combat. Can be substituted with an **Adrenaline Urn** <:adrenurn:656426717413507074> with ocassional stalling.
⬥ <:cryptbloomhelm:892819107123195956> **Magic Tank Armor** - Magic tank armor is required for **Animate Dead** <:animatedead:856635090453135382>, which is needed to mitigate enough damage for this afk method. Cryptbloom is **NOT** required for this method, but full **Ganodermic or better** is required in order to survive mechanics such as Avaryss' Ceiling Collapse attack.
⬥ <:eof:787526151978614824> **Essence of Finality** - Stored special attack is not used, but is worn for the accuracy bonus and boosted Soulsplit passive.
⬥ <:channellerring:839903943404027914> **Channeller's Ring** - Extra critical chance helps speed up kills. If not owned, can be substituted for other strong rings such as Asylum Surgeon's <:asr:513190158472839208> or Ring of Death. <:RoD:513190159462825984>
⬥ <:potionreservoir:878739200407654431>  **Potion reservoir** - Can store up to 6 doses of a potion, such as an overload, and automatically refresh that potion when its duration is low. Only one may be filled at a time, so you must manually fill a new reservoir when your current one depletes.
⬥ <:powderofpenance:928221126360969226> **Powder of Penance** - Restores prayer points equal to 2.5% of damage taken. Each one lasts for 30 minutes, and completely mitigates the need for prayer potions or the Penance aura.
.
⬥ <:LantaSticks:565726489404899368> **Lantadyme Incense Sticks** - Extends potion duration by 2 minutes per dose. ***Completely optional, use at your own discretion***.
