.tag:intro
Nex is the Zarosian general 👮 in ⤵ the 👨😆 God 🙏 Wars 🌟 dungeon. ⛓

When Nex spawns 🤑🤑 for the 👏 first 😊🕐 time 👀 in 👏 a 👌 custom instance it 😞💯 will 👏 be praying against mage for 💰💯 the 😉 majority of 😕 the 🎊 kill, 💀 this 😡 is 💥 why ❓👧 range 🤤 only ☝ kills are 🤰🏾 the meta for 🎅👏 fast 😌⚡ consistent kills. ☠ After 👀👀 every 👏 kill 💀🔫 you will 🌳 teleport out 🔮 of the 👏 instance and 😭👏 re-enter in order to force 🙅 Nex to 🍑 always ⏳🌱 be 🎄 praying mage.

Nex is a 1x1 NPC and 🍆 posses very 💎 strict softcaps, which mean that 👉🙅 any 💦💦 damage over a 😜 certain amount 📉📉 is 😮😍 reduced by 😈 X% depending on 👅🔛 the 🙅 phase. During the ⏰➡ first ☝ four phases, Nex has 👏🈶 a 😎👌 soft 🍆💦 cap that 😐 reduces excess damage above 🔝👆 **5,000 🔝😱 by 50%**. 🔫⏳ For 👉 example, 🔥 a 6,000 ❗🤘 damage ☠☄ hit 👊 would 👪 be reduced to 🌱👉 5,500 😂 damage. ☄☄ On 💰 the 🎇 Zaros phase, the 💰 soft 🍆😫 cap is 👉💦 changed 😩😩 to 😂✌ reduce excess damage ☄☄ above 🆙 **2,000 🔥🙈 by 75%**. This means 😫 a 🅰 6,000-damage 🤘🤘 hit would 👪 be 😠 reduced to ✡ 3,000. 🗣😭

.
Nex's mages have 🙋 a soft 😫 cap that 💵🗳 reduces excess damage ☠☄ above 1,000 💸📻 by ⚡🍭 a 👌🍕 random 🎲 amount 📉🔢 between 👎👉 approximately ⭕⭕ 80% and 🙄 100%. 💯💯 Each 👋👏 mage is combat level 🎚 111 with ♀ 10,000 ⬆ health, possesses a max hit of around 🍆🤧 850, and 👏 are weak 😭 to 🤸💦 bolts. The mages are 💰😠 static and ☝ can only ❤ be 🐝🅰 attacked whenever Nex calls 📞 their name. 😩 An 👹☺ unusual trait they 👥 all 🤠 share ❗🗣 is that 😍👑 they 🏽 are 🙏 immune to 💦✌ magic attacks. Cruor's attacks always have 100% 💯 accuracy 👌🏹 and 💃👏 will heal him for 100 💯💯 damage ☄☠ regardless 🤷 of 😂 the 😎 damage ☄☄ he 🙀😽 deals, while 🕑🕑 Glacies' attacks can freeze 😥 players 📱💰 if 🎅👏 they 👲👥 aren't using 🏻🤳 Protect/Deflect 🔐 Magic; keeping the 👦 prayer 🙏 active 🏃 will 🍑 result in 🎁 all 💯😏 of 💦💦 her attacks missing 💨 regardless 🤷 of 🔴 the player's 💰 armour rating.

*It is strongly advised to complete the Ritual of the Mahjarrat quest in order to get access to the Jas boost which gives a 5% damage boost in GWD1 (including Nex). This can be done via Fairy ring code D.K.Q.*

⬥ The most 💯🤚 important 😍🤣 thing is to have 💢 a 🖼🅿 Frozen key + ancient 🎶🎶 ceremonial for 👉💦 use 🚀 with 😅😋 your 👶 boss portal.
⬥ An Enhanced Luck Potion <:luckpotion:656426717295935500> works and can be used here.
⬥ You can 💦 speak to Ashuelot Reis in 😜👏 the 🅱 Nex bank 🏛🏛 and 😍👅 pay a one ☣🙀 time cost 💵 of the Frozen key + Ancient Ceremonial along 🔚 with ♀ 10M GP to 🐚👵 be 🐝😡 able 💪 to 😱 access 🚪🚪 Nex bank 🏛 without ♀❌ these 🔫 items.

.
**__Beginner Preset__**
⬥ Throw your Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> at start and on Blood phase. 
⬥ Akrisae body has Clear Headed 4 <:ch4:712073087864012840>, and is used to build with Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> at the start. 
⬥ This method relies on ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> procs on Nex. However, around Ice phase, ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> procs start to hit less than the ability they are replacing, so it’s optimal to bring a bolt switch. It is generally preferred to camp ruby <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> until ice phase, then switch to dragonstone bolts <:DragonstoneBakri:565726489144852511>.

.
__**Blood phase:**__
Siphon summon → 3 😭😭 auto-attacks 🤖 → Blood sacrifice → 3 🏼🔀 auto-attacks 🤖🤖 → Repeat 🔂🔂
⬥ Attacks during Siphon will 👑 heal Nex and 💰 sacrifice will 👏 heal Nex if 🚀👏 not 🚫 phased and 👏🚟 in range. 🤤🤤
⬥ Any bleeds used during this phase will heal Nex rather than damage her ( <:frag:535541273755385885> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> <:deadshot:535541307666595870> )

__**Zaros phase:**__ 🌓
⬥ Upon 👉👤 the 🙊🅱 start of this 💯🏽 phase, 🌒🌒 Nex activates Turmoil and ☝ heals herself 🏻 for ⛓🖍 33,333 (1/6) ♂ of her health to 😫🚻 boost it 🤕 up to 🔍 73,333.
⬥ Nex does ✊😈 not have 🐵 any unique 👰 special 💦 attacks in 👏🙅 this 👅‼ phase 🌒🌑 and 👏 uses only 👏👍 her 👸 melee and 🚫👏 magic autoattacks

Stand on the west side, once she’s phased click on Fumus and after you Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> into Fumus and make your way over to the north-western safespot, by the time she’s able to attack you Fumus should be low HP or dead depending on if you got any procs. Try and run her if she’s close to surging through the middle.

.
**__Shadow Phase__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/3qo51kq.png
During 🚣🚣 shadow make 😬 your 👉 way over 💩💦 to 👉 the 💪 north-eastern safespot, one 🍳 method is 💪 to phase 🌑 her 🏼 on the 💛 northern side ⏩⏩ then once 🌈 she is 😧 phased make your 😋 way to the north-eastern 💈 safe 👷🙏 spot whilst you're 😂 killing 🔪🔪 Umbra so ❗ you're not 🚫 stuck ☢😱 taking 💅 shadow 👤 bleed 😳 damage at the safe 👷 spot for 🤝🏻 long. 

Once phased, try 💪 to stay MD/ 2 ‼ squares 🤣🤣 away from Nex so 🏻🗣 she 💁 can 🍆👌 reach you 👧👉 instantly and begin 💦💦 siphoning.

.
**__Blood Phase__**
.img:https://i.imgur.com/GYKu8TG.png
During her siphon, make your way over to the eastern safe spot whilst staying at an even number of squares so that if she does run to you, she won’t run underneath you which could delay her attacks which could mean she won’t sacrifice if everything lines up poorly. At the eastern safespot you can click Cruor during your Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and it won’t switch unless your ability ends or Nex phases. 

After 👀👀 she 👱 is 🔥 phased, make 💸👏 your way over to 👩👁 the 💰🅱 south-eastern safespot so 🌹 she will follow 👣 you, 🎺 allowing no 🙅😱 tick loss during the 👏🌎 transition from Blood to Ice as 💦 you’ll 😀 want 🤷👈 to be MD to 🔍 Glacies during 🚣 the 👈👧 beginning ➡ of 🌈😫 Ice.

**__Ice Phase__**:

Once Cruor is dead, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to Glacies and stand MD to her.

.
**__Smoke Phase Notes__**
⬥ Throw your bomb right <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> before the kill is about to start.
⬥ Make sure to Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> with Ascensions so that there's a chance to proc the Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> effect.
⬥ If the boss doesn't phase, follow up with <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088>, and run the boss while you do so.
⬥ Both bleeds then 😂👱 good 👌 basics on 🔛👌 the 😏📢 minion.

.
**__Shadow Phase Notes__** 
⬥ If you proc a Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> during Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> into Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> without Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> .
⬥ Reprisal isn't necessary <:Reprisal:513190159462694912>, but makes it easier when you don't get a Ruby bolt <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> proc.
⬥ Both 👏🍆 bleeds and 💰 good 👌 basics on ↔ the 💦🔪 minion.

.
**__Blood Phase Notes__**
⬥ Practice your Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> timing so that it hits right when Nex is attackable, rather than healing her.
⬥ Be sure 👍🤔 to let 💂👑 her Sacrifice so you get 👽🔫 a contain first on 🔛🚟 Uce 🅱 phase 🌓
⬥ In rare cases it is possible to have to your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> in order to use Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>. In this case you will need to improvise your Zaros rotation.
⬥ Both ➡👦 bleeds and 💦🙌 good 👌👌 basics on 🥜🏽 Cruor. If 👏 Nex is 💦🍆 MDing you, 🤔👉 it's ➡🤔 worth 💰 it to run her to stall autos, but don't 🚫 worry too 👎😡 much 😂 if she does another Siphon before 🤔👉 you 😂 can phase. 🌑🌗

**__With ECB__** <:ecb:615618531937222657>
⬥ Be 🐝❌ sure 👉😊 to 💋👁 let 👑🙏 her 💁♀ Sacrifice so ❌ you get 💲 a contain first 👌 on 💩🍆 Uce 🅱🅱 phase 🌕
⬥ In rare cases it is possible to have to your Adrenaline Potion <:adrenrenewalflask:736298313980182541> in order to use Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>. In this case you will need to improvise your Zaros rotation.

.
**__Ice Phase Notes__**
⬥ If you 🚫💦 get 🎎 prisoned before targeting Glacies you 💦 can 👍 target cycle to 💦😦 attack 🤼 him.
⬥ To walk your Frag Shot pre phase, you can either walk under Nex during phasing or Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to glacies out of max distance so she walks the Frag.
⬥ Place mines when you <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.
⬥ Double bleed + good basics on minion again. Eat lots of Jellies and Guthix Rests. Try to <:frag:535541273755385885> first. Tag Nex ASAP to phase to Zaros.
⬥ Even without Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912>, it's not a big deal if you do the rest of the rotation correctly. 

**__With ECB__** <:ecb:615618531937222657>
⬥ Place mines when you Dark Bow spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>

.
**__Zaros Phase Notes__**
⬥ Disruption shield <:disrupt:535614336207552523> may be used if you are low on food.
⬥ You can 🔫🍞 run Nex if ☝👏 low 🏻 on 💩 food, 🍆 but 😜🤔 don't 🚫 need 🍆👏 to 🍆💦 (and 👏💦 will 😳 end up walking ♀♀ book procs). It's 🅱🙅 optimal to do 😤 so if 🏼⬅ you ♀ notice her 💁🐩 SS 💲 is ✅ active. ☢👏

> __**Advanced Video Example:**__
.tag:video
This is a sample 31 kill hour using the Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> and its special attack. Kills following this rotation should average out at around sub 1:30. You can also use this as a visual guide for movement during the kill.
