*Note: Sections 1, 2, and 3 were written with the assumption that the player has an Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> in EoF <:eofor:745279787471470713>. If you do not have an Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> in EoF <:eofor:745279787471470713>, you should substitute with Dark Bow EoF Spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.*

.
**__Room 1__**
Tag a slime with Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885> and Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> while luring the slimes together to use Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>. With Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881> use Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and utilize Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> and Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> in combination with Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> to clear the slimes. 4 slimes must be killed to open the barrier. Stuns and binds should be utilized here as the slimes cannot multiply while stunned/bound.

.
**__Room 2__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> and tag the nearest dragon with Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>. Proceed down the steps and kill the dragon there in near melee distance to lure the other 2 dragons together. Proceed to Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> the remaining 2 dragons and kill them to open the barrier. Diagonally Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the dragon next to the barrier and turn around to use Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881> on the now stacked dragons -- use Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> here. Lastly kill the 4th dragon to open the barrier.

.
**__Room 3__**
Run to this spot along the east wall just past the middle pillar to stack the magma golems to use Mechanised Chinchompas <:mechchin:641669268722810881>.  Only 3 golems must be killed to open the barrier so Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> should do the trick.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/qzt0o4X.png
**__Room 4__**
Diagonally Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> towards the next barrier and run around to behind the celestial dragon to stack the slimes behind it.  From here stun the celestial then target a stacked slime for a Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>.  Clean up the remaining slimes with further stuns until the barrier opens.

.
**__Room 5__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> and run up against the west wall.  Use Deaths Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> here against the wall and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> down the celestials. Diagonally Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> down the steps and tag the closer celestial.  Run up against the east wall to use the remaining Deaths Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> timer to kill this celestial to open the barrier. Run down the steps and use Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and basics to kill 1 of the celestials.

.
**__Room 6__**
Stack the 2 nearest celestials and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> them down to open the barrier.

.
*Note: Room 6 actually occurs after Astellarn.*

This 👈🍆 fight 😡💥 heavily 😃 utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics 💰💰 but is 💦 still 👉 very 👌🍀 straightforward and 😫 easy to 💯 master 🥇 with some 🏡👆 practice. 🍆🍆 Tag Astellarn to 🎀👍 start the 🤜🏻 fight and 🌞 begin 💦📦 DPSing. After 2-3 😂 autoattacks a Pulsar will spawn with 20,000 🎉 hp, dealing 🚬🚬 moderate periodic damage. Shortly after, 💯 a bar 😮😫 will appear ‼⁉ above 😩👆 the player's 💰 head 👱⬅ and 🏽🍏 a 👌👌 wyrmhole will 👏💦 spawn at their 😍 current 💰 location ✔ when 💕 it fills. Place the 🌫 wyrmhole along these ♂ lines to prevent 🚫🚫 it ✊🏿 from being 😑♂ blocked 😱 out 😠🌐 by the 🔪👩 later 🌃 rain 🅱 mechanic. 
.img:https://i.imgur.com/DL8fq7i.jpg

.
When 👌😩 the 📚 wyrmhole spawns, it 💯😂 will ♀ deal continuous damage ☠☠ to anyone 👩👨 standing 🏿🏿 in it. ✊💯 Step 👣 away 👆🌪 and ➕ continue 💰 dpsing until 🕖 the Neutron 👌👌 Star spawns. 🤑🤑 This will 🙈 follow 👣 the player 🤺📅 around 🕤💦 and 👏🌞 must 🙏💰 be 🏻🐝 lured into 👏👏 the ✊⭐ wyrmhole. If 🤔☝ the 💶 Neutron 😂😂 Star ⭐🌟 touches 🏼 a ♥ player, it will explode, dealing 👦👦 5000 damage ☄ and 💯 it 😝🍆 is highly recommended to 💰👏 teleport out 🚏 and 👏👏 restart the fight 🏾 in 🕺 this 👈 case. 👌💯 The 💰💌 wymhole will 💎 become 🤦♂ stabilized and 👏 turn 🔄🔁 white 👱 if this 🍑 mechanic is dealt with ➡ properly, ☑☑ allowing you 👶 to stand 👬👬 in 🔫 it 🙌🍝 and 🏿 deal increased damage ☄☠ to 💦💬 Astellarn for 🎅 it's ✅😍 duration.

The 👩 celestial rain 💦 will begin 📦📦 once ⁉ the boss 💼💼 reaches 200,000 hp. This will 🌳🎤 spawn a 💩 continuous rain ⛈⛈ in 📥👇 a 😝 random quadrant that deals increasing damage ☠ as 🅰👦 long as it 💦👌 is 🤔 stood ♂🙋 in. 👏 This will 👫 change 😩🔀 quadrants occasionally 🐶🐶 and will 👏 only 😂 be a major 😳😳 issue 😭 if 😳 the 👨⏲ wyrmhole was 👏 placed improperly.

From 👉 here 💦 on, these 🥜 mechanics 💰💰 repeat 🔂 with 💰👏 the rain 🌂🌧 lasting for the remainder of 💦💤 the 🚗 encounter.

.
**__Strategy__**
Do not use <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> to start the fight. Astellarn will heavily cap damage starting at 200,000 hp so the goal is to use a few thresholds before prephasing with an <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> as close to 200,000 as possible. Build to <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> on the pulsar with basics and place the wyrmhole in melee distance. After placing, run straight back to the wall along the quadrant line and build on Astellarn while waiting for the Neutron Star to spawn. Lure the Neutron Star to your wyrmhole and use <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → improvise.

*Note: Dragons are numbered in the order you encounter them.*

.
**__Room 1__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> + Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the nearest pair of lava strykewyrms and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> them down with Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>.

.
**__Room 2__**
Use an Acceleration Powerburst <:accel:756236265472524418> after the barrier to quickly reach Room 2. Go all the way to melee distance of the 3rd dragon and use a Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> before running back west to drag dragons 3 and 4.  Doing this should in turn drag dragons 1 and 2 east setting both pairs up to be chinned. Finish them off with thresholds but try to exit Room 2 with high adrenaline.

.
**__Room 3__**
Run past the 1st 3 dragons then around to the south side of the 4th dragon and use Deaths Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>.  Target dragon 2 and step back up against the black rocks to drag it south. This should also draw dragons 5 and 6 closer. Use a Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on dragon 2. Proceed to target dragon 4 again and kill it. Use a Mechanised Chinchompa<:mechchin:641669268722810881> Dark Bow EoF Spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on dragon 1 and kill it then turn around and Chin <:mechchin:641669268722810881> dragons 5 and 6.  Finish off the remaining dragons to open the barrier.

**__Room 4__**
Eldritch Crossbow Spec <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> and kill the 4 lava strykewyrms nearest to the barrier with thresholds.

.
**__Room 5__**
Target the farthest north dragon and step back to drag it and the middle dragon west before using a Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> on the middle dragon. Finish off these 3 dragons and the 1 by the barrier with basics and thresholds.  Be careful to exit with 100% adren for Verak Lith.

This 😎👈 boss 👨 fight 🏾✊ follows 🏃 a ☠ very 👿 predictable attack ⚔⚔ rotation but ❌ deals consistent moderately high 💨 damage so 💯 it 💯👏 is 😬 recommended to learn 🎓 the few mechanics 💰 properly ☑ to 💦 avoid any 🤣🏼 unnecessary deaths. It 👏 will always ⏱ melee auto 🤖 attack 🤼 when 🕙 the 👏👭 player is ❌ in 👏 melee distance and 👌 always 🕔 mage otherwise. The 🐫 auto 🤖 attacks hit 👊👊 quite 🅰 hard 😩🍆 and 😈 specifically 🔵🔵 the mage ones are 🤓🏼 desynced visually so 💯 it 🤖 is 🅱💦 important to 💰 not mess ☠😄 up 👀 too 😡😡 many 👧👨 prayer 🙏 flicks here. ❌📐

.
**__Verak Lith's Attack Rotation__**
4 Auto attacks → Spire → 4 👀 Auto 🤖 attacks → Ricochet → 4 💦💦 Auto 🤖 attacks → Spire → 4 🙇 Auto 🤖 Attacks → Nosedive/Hurricanes → Repeat

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Spire**: The 👨🐕 message "Verak Lith slams 👊👊 his tail against the ground, the 💦😍 earth 🗺🌎 shakes beneath ⚰⚰ your 👉 feet!" will appear ‼ and 🙇👌 after 🍊🔜 a 💩 short delay and 😘🙏 spire with 👏 15,000 👩🔳 hp will 👏💯 spawn near 😯 the player. 🎮 The ♋💞 boss 💼😎 will be immune to 💦🏼 damage ☄ while 🕑🙌 the spire is 💦👌 alive 🔅😤 so 😮 it is 💯 good to threshold to ➡➡ get it 😉💯 down ⬇ immediately. 💰 The spawn will 👏 also ➕🅱 be 🅱 accompanied by 😈 a moderate melee hit that 🍑🗳 can 🤖🛠 be 😠🐝 resonanced. In 👏 a 🥔😱 typical 🏃🏃 kill, 💀 this 🎊⬆ will 🤔 be 🎮 the primary method alongside soul 😱😱 split 🚻🚻 flicking to 💦💦 restore hp.

.
⬥ **Ricochet**: Verak Lith will send 💌 out 🔫 a projectile that 🤔😐 lands at ❓🍆 a 👴 spot 💓 around the 🤤🅱 player after 🔜🏻 a 👌😂 few 👇 seconds. The 👏💦 element of this 😭😡 projectile can 💦🔫 be poison, 🤒🤒 ice, or 💯 shock, 😨 and corresponds with 👏 the three 💁 groups of 😏 eggs 🍳 found 🚫😳 around the arena. The correct ✅ way ↕ to 💰👂 deal with 🤝👏 this mechanic is 🙈 to 💦 pick 🤗 up 👀 the 🌊 projectile and 👏 interact with a DIFFERENT type ✍⌨ of 💦 egg 🥚 to disperse it 😫🐐 before the 🌎 bar fills up. 👏 Missing 💨💨 the projectile will deal 4000 damage and ➕ missing 💨 the 🤴 dispersal can deal 9000+ damage ☠ so 👆 it 👎 is 😅 especially important not 🚫 to miss ⚽ the 😃🏥 second 🕐 half of 👏👏 this 😂💻 mechanic. Generally, 👀 if 💀🙎 the ‼🦉 projectile matches the 😂😄 element of the 📈😏 nearest group of 🤤 eggs 🍳🍳 to 💋🎼 the 👏💦 player, it 😫 should 👶 be ignored 😒 with 😣 disruption shield, 💦 debilitate, or 💁 reflect (or 🏼😇 nothing 🚫🔥 if 🤔 the player 🎮🤺 is 💰💦 high 🌲🆙 hp). This 🙎 will 🅱👏 end the ⏩ mechanic early. 🕐

.
⬥ **Nosedive**: A message ♀💁 will 💣 appear ‼‼ on 🔛 the 🎁🙅 screen 🖥🖥 mentioning that a 🏿 dragon 🐉🐲 is 🤔👏 nosediving. An 👌 arrow will show 👀👈 up 🖕 near 😯 the 😫👏 player to indicate the 👘👏 direction the dragon 🐉 is 🙏 approaching from 👉 and, 💰😲 after a short 👉👉 delay, a 🙀 thin 💃💃 line 🚫👦 of 💦 dragonbreath will ⚽🍆 be 😒 fired 💥 along 🔚 the line 👧🙋 the 🤝🅱 arrow 💘 is 👍👏 pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic 📿📿 damage and can 🔫🔫 be avoided by 😈 simply 😡 moving out 🅱 of 💦 the 👈 way. 💫↕ However, the arrow will adjust it's position 🙏 based 😣 on ➡👗 the 🖇😩 player's 💰♀ movement for 👍 a short period so it 🏿🙂 is 🙈 recommended to 💯 learn 👨 the 👏 timing on 🏽💰 this 💯 mechanic and 💦😽 move as it goes 🍆🍆 off. 💨💦

.
⬥ **Hurricanes**: Verak Lith will 👌 say 🤔 "Let the 👨 flames melt 🦅⚒ the 👏 flesh from your 🍆 bones" and engulf the 🎁🏳 area around 😵😪 the player 💰🤷 in 👌 fire. This will 🤤💦 deal no 🚫🙅 damage ☠☠ but 👹 after 👊🍆 a short delay, hurricanes will 💣😛 spawn in 🅱 the 👏👉 area that 🚟😐 deal extremely 💯🤔 high 🆙 damage ☠☠ and 😩 last for 😱 roughly 20 🔳🔳 seconds. 🕚😫 This is 💦👉 a fairly large area attack and should 💘👍 be surged from 💥 to 💦✌ be 🏻 a 😾 safe 🙏 distance away. 🏃🙅 It 😤 isn't very 👿 complicated however, 🖐🤔 simply 😡😡 don't touch a 👌 hurricane.

.
**__Strategy__**
Start out the fight with <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and try to get in <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> before the first spire but be wary as sgb specing too late will get it nulled. Kill the spire basics then end your <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> with <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>. Disrupt the Ricochet rather than going to it and try to get in a <:snap:535534127131394088> before the 2nd spire while building. Kill the 2nd spire with basics then <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> right away. Dodge the Nosedive while doing <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:rapid:535541270521708566> and improvise from there with possibly a <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> if Verak's hp is low.

Tag the 1st dragonstone dragon with Fragmentation Shot <:frag:535541273755385885> and run back towards the pole to lure the dragons together.  A Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Seren Godbow EoF Spec <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> and a Mechanised Chinchompa <:mechchin:641669268722810881> Dark Bow EoF Spec <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> should be used here to clear the stacked dragons.

The 🔍👈 Black 👱🏿 Stone Dragon 🐲 is 👌🤔 the 🅱 final 🔮🌠 boss encounter in 👉 the 🖇🅱 Dragonkin 🐉 Laboratory and ✔ is 👏 the main source of 🌈 the 👀 dungeon's primary unique: 👰👌 Draconic Energies, which are 👏👴 used 🚟🙄 to 🎓💦 make 👏🖌 the mage t92 Elite 🏻 Tectonic set. 📚📒 It ♂ also ☹ drops ⬇⬇ the Mutated Barge Codex, which sees 👁 frequent use ⚒ in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of 🤖🌈 fairly simple 😂🔢 mechanics but 🔮 can be very ✅📈 punishing if 👏⚖ mistakes 😵😵 are 👏 made. 🍔 It ⁉💧 is ❤🔥 also 👨 one ☝ of 💰💦 the 🌊👏 few 📅 bosses to auto attack in 📅⬇ all three 🏫 combat styles, with 👏😍 melee hitting especially hard, so 💯 it 😘 is 💦 possible 🔝🔝 to die 💕 just 👏😤 from 🏼 auto attacks if 👏💲 the 👻➡ player can't 💦 outheal with 🅱👏 soul split, 🚻🚻 is 🅰🙀 low ⬇ on food, and/or can't 💦🤸 prayer flick the fight.

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Gemstone Spikes**: This mechanic occurs a 🅰 few auto attacks into 👉 the 🖖😼 start of 😤😱 the 🎆☠ fight 👊 and after 👀😜 each 👏 dragonbreath after 👀 phase 🌑🌘 1. 😢💸 This is 💦 identical to 🙌💦 the 🕵💡 hydrix dragon 🐉 special ✌ attack where 🏿🏿 a 💀 line 👦 of 💦💯 spikes are 👏👄 shot 🔫🔫 through the ground 😭😩 and 🤤 erupt under 👇 the 💍 player. 🏋 This 💀 deals 5000+ melee damage ☄ and 💰🌈 drains ⌛⌛ all 💯🍆 adrenaline 💉💉 upon 💰💰 impact. It 🤔😩 will 👏👏 also ➕👨 apply 😤 a debuff that reduces all ❗ adrenaline 💉💉 gain 🔼🔼 by 50% 👌👏 for 🎁 a 👌 short ⬇ duration. Simply move ♀ out 👀 of 🍌 the 🏳💯 way ↕ when this ☣🅿 comes 🍆 out.

.
⬥ **Dragonbreath**: The skybox will 💰💦 turn dark 🌌🕶 blue and 🌍 Black Stone ☄😤 Dragon 🐲🐲 will fire a 🔥🏿 100% 💯💯 accuracy mage attack that 👌 deals moderate damage. ☄ This 😩👈 is essentially just 👌👏 a mage auto attack 🤼 that hits slightly harder 🔨😍 but 🍑 signals that the 🅱💻 spikes are 😫👌 coming 🤤 out immediately 😭👏 after 👀 (phase 🌑🌔 3). 🥜😘

This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal <:rapid:535541270521708566> 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will NEVER reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured above. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. 

.
⬥ **Smoke Spiral**: A 🔫🅰 line 🙋👦 of 👌🤑 smoke will spiral inwards towards ⛪ Black Stone 🚬🙌 Dragon, 🐉 dealing 🚬 4000+ damage ☠☠ per 👼 tick if stood on. 🍆 The boss will 🏿👏 remain 🔕 stationary during this 🍆😠 time ⌛☝ so 😮💯 flanking is 😄🐶 possible 🔝 here. It 💁😢 is recommended to 🗣 learn 🏫 where you 🏿🌐 can 🔥 stand 🏿♂ safely 🔫🚦 to 👉 avoid having 😋😋 to 😯♂ cancel ❌❌ channeled abilities. Generally, a 🅰 max range 💦🤤 death swiftness to the 👏💪 sides of 💦 the 😱 boss 🏽 will provide decent freedom of ♨👏 movement and ✔🌈 allow for flanking.

.
⬥ **Mage AoE**: Black 👨◼ Stone 🚬☄ Dragon 🐉🐲 will 👏🖕 call 🍔 out 😝🌃 "GET. ♀🔟 OUT. 💯📤 OF. 💰 ME." 👀😭 or 🅱🍆 "The 👧🆘 shadow overwhelms!" and turn to 🚶🆔 fire a 👌💰 black ◼ projectile towards ⛪⛪ a random 🎲🔀 spot 💓 in 🍑 the 😘 arena. This is very 👍 similar to ☃ Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will 👏🏻 explode 💥💥 into black tendrils that 👉 deal 4000+ damage in 🚗 the 🐆 area for 🐻💕 a 💰 short 🕛👉 period. 🔴 In 🏼 a 💰♀ solo 👆😂 encounter, this will miss 😤 most 💯 of the 🍆 time ⁉ and isn't a big 💪 concern. 😕😕 The 🕸💦 boss ☝ can also be 👏🐝 flanked when 🕛🍑 it 🙂 turns 💫💫 to 💦💦 send out the 👉 special. ☄

.
⬥ **Fly**: ✈🦋 Upon 👉 hitting 250,000 hp, Black 👨 Stone Dragon 🐉🐉 will become invulnerable and fly around 💦🌐 the arena, landing at 👌❤ various spots and 💰 sending out 🤷 smoke 🚬🚬 lines ➖ towards the 👑 player 🎮 each 👏👋 time. ⌚ Additional lines will ♀😯 also 😨 spawn out 💦 of existing ones 💯 on 🔛🥜 each land, 💯 so 💯👌 movement can get 🉐⏳ hectic if ☝💦 the 🚟 boss 😂☝ lands at 🍗🍆 the same 💩🤷 area multiple times. ⏰😢 This 🏾👉 smoke 🚬🚫 is 👌 functionally identical to 🎶 the 🚦 type ⌨📝 in ☝ the spiral mechanic and should 💘👌 be avoided at all 👦💯 costs. This ⬆👏 will occur 7 💯 times 🕛 before 🤔 the boss 👴🏼 becomes 📉📉 vulnerable again and 👏 continues the 🏡 phase 🌓 3 🗣 rotation starting from 😂👉 smoke 🚬🚬 spiral. The lines ➖ will not spawn if 👏☝ the boss lands out 💯👍 of 🤔😂 range 🤤 but 🔮💏 it 🅱 is 💦😩 still 🙌😻 highly ⬆🔊 recommended to follow and 💯💦 use an 👹🏻 ability 👉👉 after 💯👀 each 👏 landing as 🏿💰 the 👏✨ boss 😂 will ⚽📃 take longer 🕚 to 🌒💦 fly again ❌ if 🙄 the 👄💪 player stays far 🌐 away.

**__Strategy__**
Start out the fight with <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> and use <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → improvise to phase the boss. Spam <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> to kill the Black Hands. <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> right away on BSD and use <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> or <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> (if hp is close to or below 250,000). BSD will enter the flying phase where it is near immune to damage; however, Soul Split will still heal you as if full damage was dealt during this phase. Count the jumps and activate <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> when BSD jumps for the 6th time and build to <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936>. In <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> use <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → improvise to finish it off.
