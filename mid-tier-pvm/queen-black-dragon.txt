> __**Overview of the Fight**__
.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1:**__
⬥ QBD attacks with <:range:580168050121113623> or <:melee:615612332521029632> auto attacks (when the player is standing 2 tiles north from the platform artefact) and the occasional fire wall.

.
⬥ **Fire Wall**
    • The chatbox will say "The Queen Black Dragon takes a huge breath." prior to her fire wall special attack.
    • If the fire wall hits your character, your character will take 750 typeless damage for each tick (generally 2 ticks) it hits you.
    • By walking through it, you only take 1 tick of damage and because of this, it is recommended to walk through the firewall.
    • However, with each firewall, there is a gap where you can stand and not take any damage.
        - The gap will either be on the 5th square, 9th square (one left of the center artefact) or the 15th square.

.
⬥ Phase 1 can be ended by depleting her life pool of 25k HP and activating the middle artefact. The QBD will spit out grotworms until you activate the artefact.

.
__**Phase 2:**__
⬥ QBD will do her previous mechanics however with each Phase her fire wall gets stronger.
    • In Phase 1, the firewall will have 1 wall you have to pass through.
    • In Phase 2, it will have 2 walls.
    • In Phase 3, there will be 3 walls, and so on.

.
⬥ **Tortured Souls**
    • There will be an onscreen message saying "The Queen Black Dragon summons one of her Captured Souls."
    • This mechanic causes 1 Tortured Soul to appear and release a cloud that deals 900 damage to the player unless it hits a Tortured Soul or grotworm first.
        - One way to deal with this mechanic is to learn how to time the cloud correctly and walk over the Tortured Soul, causing it to deal 900 damage to the Soul instead of you.

.
__**Phase 3:**__
⬥ From now on QBD will breathe 4 fire walls for the reminder of the fight.

.
⬥ She will now summon 2 Tortured Souls instead of 1.
    • 1 Soul will spawn on each side of the player, so in order to avoid getting damaged, move over one when the text box appears above their head.
    • In addition to the 2 Tortured Souls, any Souls in the arena can be used to heal the QBD.
        - The chatbox will say "The Queen Black Dragon starts to siphon the energy of her mages." and will heal her 200 each tick from each Tortured Soul.

.
⬥ **Crystal Form/Hardened Carapace** 
    • The Queen Black Dragon takes on the consistency of crystal; she is more resistant to magic, but weaker to physical damage.
        - This means she will take 25% less <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage and 25% more <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> damage. 
    • The Queen Black Dragon hardens her carapace; she is more resistant to physical damage, but more vulnerable to magic.
        - This means she will take 25% less damage from <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> but 25% more <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage.

.
__**Phase 4:**__
⬥ She will now summon 4 Tortured Souls (one on each diagonal from the character). This Phase only has 2 new mechanics.

.
⬥ **Time Stop**
    • A Soul will appear in one of the far corners of the arena saying 3 of the following: "Time is short!", "She is pouring her energy into me...hurry!" and "The spell is nearly complete!".
        - You must kill the Tortured Soul or QBD before the Tortured Soul says all three.
        - If the Tortured Soul gets to the final dialogue, a few seconds later you will be frozen for a few seconds, unable to move, eat, or do anything until the special is over.
        - This can be very deadly if paired with a Tortured Soul Special or the QBD's final special attack, the Extreme Dragon Breath.

.
⬥ **Extreme Dragon Breath**
    • Does high hitting damage if not avoided correctly and is prompted when the chat box says, "The Queen Black Dragon gathers her strength to breathe extremely hot flames.".
        - It is recommended to stand on the far right side of the arena in order to avoid as much of the attack as possible.
        - If you stand in the center of the arena, you will take over twice the amount of damage as the side.
        - This also is the special attack needed to brand the Royal Crossbow.
