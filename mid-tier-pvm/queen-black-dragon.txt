> **Introduction**
The only requirement for this boss is 60 summoning to go into the Queen Black Dragons arena. She is located just west of Port Sarim in the grotworm cave. Located on the third floor down, Queen Black Dragon is a really good boss to prepare for mechanics found in high tier bosses like Araxxor and Telos. While frustrating at first, this boss is a very good example of the value of practice in RS3 PvM.
It is _highly_ recommended to have 80 in your preferred combat stat (generally <:range:580168050121113623> or <:Magic:689504724159823906> ), 85 Herblore for Super-Antifires, as well as the Song of the Depths quest completed to reduce the amount of damage received.
There are four phases to the Queen Black Dragons fight. Each phase can include all the previous phases' mechanics.

**Advanced Preset:**
<:soulsplit:615613924506599497> + <:aosor:544200033847869443>, along with occasional excalibur to maintain HP. The melee weapons are used to <:bd:535532854281764884> to activate pillars and the godbook is only used for its passive stats. Make sure to use the dragon slayer perk on your armour and the ability every other kill. It is recommended to use a <:Titan:513195724738002944> / <:ripperpouch:703581275453128714>

<:ds:535541258924326912> at the start of every kill and try to finish every kill at 100% adren. Use dark bow autos with dragonbane arrows at the start of every phase and <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> on the third phase.

Note: You can downgrade or upgrade what you have to in order to meet your skill level and budget. You can comfortably do the boss with chaotic crossbows or a royal crossbow.

> **Phases:**

**Phase 1:** 
Only Mechanics are her <:range:580168050121113623> and <:melee:615612332521029632> attacks and the occasional fire wall. The chatbox will say "The Queen Black Dragon takes a huge breath." prior to her fire wall special attack. If the fire wall hits your character, your character will take 750 typeless damage for each tick (generally two ticks) it hits you. If you choose to walk through it, you only take one tick of damage and because of this, it is recommended to walk through the firewall. However, with each firewall, there is a gap where you can stand and not take any damage. The gap will either be on the  5th square, 9th square (one left of the center artifact) or the 15th square. The phase can be ended by damaging her 25000 amount of damage and activating the pillar. The QBD will spit out grotworms until you activate the artifact.

.
**Phase 2:**
QBD will do her previous mechanics, including the firewall and regular attacks. However, with each phase her fire wall gets stronger. In Phase 1, the firewall will have 1 wall you have to pass through. On Phase 2, it will have two walls. On Phase 3, three walls, and so on. The new mechanic in this phase is the Tortured Souls Mechanic. In the chatbox, the message "The Queen Black Dragon summons one of her captured souls." This mechanic causes a tortured soul to appear and release a cloud that deals 900 damage to the player unless it hits a tortured soul or grotworm first. One way to deal with this mechanic is to learn how to time the cloud correctly and walk over the tortured soul, causing it to deal 900 damage to the soul instead of you.

.
**Phase 3:**
QBD will have four walls this phase. Her Tortured Soul Special will now summon two tortured souls instead of one. One soul will spawn on each side of the player, so in order to avoid getting damaged, move over one when the text appears above their head. In addition two the two tortured souls, any souls in the arena can be used to heal the QBD . The chatbox will say "The Queen Black Dragon starts to siphon the energy of her mages." and will heal her 200 each tick from each tortured soul.
Her final possible special on phase 3 is her Crystal Form/Hardened Carapace special. 
`The Queen Black Dragon takes on the consistency of crystal; she is more resistant to magic, but weaker to physical damage.` means she will take 25% less <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage and 25% more <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> damage. 
`The Queen Black Dragon hardens her carapace; she is more resistant to physical damage, but more vulnerable to magic.` means she will take 25% less damage from <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> but 25% more <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage.

.
**Phase 4:**
In addition to the four firewalls and four tortured souls (one on each diagonal from the character), this phase only has two new mechanics. The first new mechanic is called the Time Stop special. A soul will appear in one of the far corners of the arena saying all three of the following, "Time is short!" "She is pouring her energy into me...hurry!" "The spell is nearly complete!" You must kill the tortured soul or QBD before  the tortured soul says all three. If the tortured soul gets to the final dialogue, a few seconds later you will be frozen for a few seconds, unable to move, eat, or do anything until the special is over.  This can be very deadly if paired with a tortured soul special or the QBD's final special attack, the Extreme Dragon Breath.  The Extreme Dragon Breath ability does high hitting damage if not avoided correctly and is prompted when the chat box says, "The Queen Black Dragon gathers her strength to breathe extremely hot flames.". This also is the special to brand the Royal Crossbow. It is recommended to stand on the far right side of the arena in order to avoid as much of the attack as possible. If you stand in the center of the arena, you will take over twice the amount of damage as the side.
