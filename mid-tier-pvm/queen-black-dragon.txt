> __**Overview of the Fight**__
.tag:thefight
__**Phase 1:**__
⬥ QBD attacks with <:range:580168050121113623> or <:melee:615612332521029632> auto attacks (when the player is standing 2 tiles north from the platform artefact) and the occasional fire wall.

.
⬥ **Fire Wall**
    • The ☸ chatbox will say "The 👩 Queen Black Dragon 🐉🐲 takes 💜 a 🍂 huge 😮🤤 breath." 🌬♂ prior 🔙🔙 to her fire wall ⌨😜 special attack. ⚔🤼
    • If the fire 🔥 wall ⌨⌨ hits 👊 your 👈 character, 💀 your 💦 character 💀🙉 will 👏❓ take 😈✍ 750 typeless damage for 💰 each tick (generally 😄 2 👱 ticks) it hits 👊🎯 you. 👉👆
    • By 😈👀 walking ♀ through 🗺 it, 🍆 you 👏 only 💯👐 take 1 tick of 💦 damage and 😂 because ♋ of this, ⁉😷 it 🔫👍 is recommended to 🙌💦 walk through 🅾🤢 the 🤣👈 firewall.
    • However, 🖐🖐 with each 👏 firewall, there 🤔✔ is 💦🔥 a 👌 gap where 🐕 you can stand 💨 and 🌚👏 not take any 💦🍵 damage. ☠☠
        - The 👏🚟 gap will 👏⚽ either be on the 👏 5th square, 9th square (one 👏 left 👈 of 💦💦 the center artefact) or 😛 the 15th square.

.
⬥ Phase 🌑🌓 1 ⚡ can be 😠 ended 🔚 by depleting her 😩 life pool 🌊🌊 of 25k HP and 🔣😂 activating the 👏⚕ middle 🖕🖕 artefact. The 👏👧 QBD will 🏿📃 spit out grotworms until you 👨 activate the artefact.

.
__**Phase 2:**__ 💦🙊
⬥ QBD will 🙈👻 do 😠 her 👧♀ previous mechanics however 😐 with 🍨😣 each Phase 🌕 her 👊👸 fire wall gets stronger. 💪💪
    • In 👉⬇ Phase 🌔 1, 😭👱 the firewall will 🌳 have 🈶😝 1 👱 wall you have 😣 to 👸 pass through.
    • In Phase 🌕😶 2, 😍 it ✔💯 will have 👏🙄 2 🔥🙀 walls.
    • In Phase 🌒 3, 🥜😭 there 👌 will be 👨 3 👏❤ walls, and so on.

.
⬥ **Tortured Souls**
    • There 💍👌 will 👏 be 💎🐝 an onscreen message ♀🅱 saying 👄🗣 "The 👈 Queen 😌 Black 👨🏴 Dragon summons one of 🤤🎖 her 😍 Captured Souls."
    • This mechanic causes 1 Tortured Soul 😱👼 to appear ‼⁉ and 🔣 release 💰 a 👨 cloud ☁☁ that 😐😐 deals 900 damage ☄☄ to ➡ the player 💰👨 unless 👏 it 💉 hits 🎯 a Tortured Soul or grotworm first. ☝
        - One 🔪😤 way to 💸 deal with 💦😠 this 👏 mechanic is 😍😩 to 🍆 learn 👨 how 💯👏 to 👂 time 🕐 the 🙅 cloud correctly and 💦 walk 🚶🏼 over the Tortured Soul, 👻 causing it to 💵 deal 900 damage to 💦 the 🍝 Soul 😱 instead 👽 of 🏻😂 you.

.
__**Phase 3:**__ 😳🔀
⬥ From now on 🔛 QBD will 🤔👏 breathe 4 👨 fire 🔥🔥 walls 🖼 for 🔆👏 the 💦💰 reminder of 💦💦 the ⚕ fight.

.
⬥ She will now 😏😩 summon 2 👀 Tortured Souls instead 🔖 of ❤ 1. ➗👩
    • 1 🙅 Soul 👻👻 will 💍⚽ spawn on each side 🚔👳 of 💦😏 the 🐕 player, ♀💰 so 🌃💯 in 👏 order ❌📑 to 🅱 avoid getting 🙀😋 damaged, move ♂ over 💦 one when the text 📲 box appears above 👆 their 🏿👩 head. 🤕👱
    • In 👏 addition ➕ to the ⏩ 2 Tortured Souls, any 🔥 Souls in the 👏👩 arena can be ☮ used 😏 to 💰😠 heal the 💦 QBD.
        - The chatbox will say "The Queen Black Dragon 🐉 starts 🕹 to 👍 siphon the ♂👏 energy 😈🔌 of 🤑💰 her 👩💁 mages." and 💃〰 will 😜🍆 heal her 200 each 👏 tick from 💥👉 each 👋 Tortured Soul. 👻👻

.
⬥ **Crystal Form/Hardened 💦💦 Carapace** 
    • The 🎁👧 Queen 😣 Black ⬛ Dragon 🐲 takes 💜💜 on 😖🔛 the 👏⏩ consistency of 💦 crystal; she 😍♀ is 🙄💯 more resistant to magic, but weaker 👎👎 to 🌈🏻 physical damage. ☄
        - This means she will take 25% less <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage and 25% more <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> damage. 
    • The Queen 😥💞 Black 👴 Dragon 🐲 hardens her ❌ carapace; she 🐰 is 🎃 more 🙈 resistant to physical 💏 damage, ☠☄ but more vulnerable to 😱💦 magic. ✨✨
        - This means she will take 25% less damage from <:melee:615612332521029632> and <:range:580168050121113623> but 25% more <:Magic:689504724159823906> damage.

.
__**Phase 4:**__ 🙏💦
⬥ She 👧👸 will now 😡👇 summon 4 💦🏽 Tortured Souls (one 👆😤 on each 👋 diagonal from 👉 the 💴 character). 🙉💀 This Phase only 👏😤 has 2 😂🙈 new 🆕 mechanics.

.
⬥ **Time ⏲👌 Stop** ♂
    • A ☢🌉 Soul 👻👼 will 👊👏 appear ‼ in one 🏼 of 💦👨 the far 💦💶 corners 📦📦 of ♂ the 💳👶 arena saying 3 of 😣💦 the following: "Time 😭⌚ is short!", 🕛👉 "She is 🙈💦 pouring 🚿 her energy into me...hurry!" 🔫😞 and "The 👏💦 spell 🏻🏻 is 💦 nearly complete!".
        - You 💦 must kill the 💰 Tortured Soul 👼👻 or 🥛 QBD before ⬇ the 🤔👏 Tortured Soul 👻👻 says 💬🗨 all 😙💯 three. 💁💁
        - If 🤔 the Tortured Soul 👻👼 gets 💪😵 to 🏻😯 the 👏😍 final 🌠🌠 dialogue, a 🚮⏰ few 📅 seconds 🕞 later 🕑 you will ⚽ be frozen for a 💰 few seconds, 🕚 unable to move, ♀🏃 eat, or 😇 do anything 😫😑 until 🅱 the ㊙ special 💦 is 💦💦 over. 🤔🙊
        - This 👇👈 can 💰 be 📖⚰ very 💎✅ deadly 😏 if 👏 paired with a ⚒ Tortured Soul 😱👼 Special 🎁✈ or the QBD's final 🌠🔮 special 🎁💦 attack, 🤼🤼 the 🚟 Extreme 💯💯 Dragon Breath.

.
⬥ **Extreme 💯 Dragon 🐲 Breath** 💨
    • Does 🏋❓ high 👍 hitting 😦😦 damage ☄ if 👏🅱 not 🚫🚫 avoided correctly ✔ and 🎅 is prompted when the chat 🏿 box 📦 says, "The 😹 Queen 💦 Black Dragon 🐲🐉 gathers her strength to 👌 breathe 👄 extremely 🤤😝 hot 😩🔥 flames.".
        - It is recommended to ✌👁 stand on 🔛🤣 the 👏 far right 👌👌 side ♂ of the 💶🏳 arena in 💦🕕 order 🤜❌ to 💦 avoid 🙅🙅 as 😐🕐 much 🈯 of ☠ the attack ⚔🤼 as 🏿 possible. 🔝
        - If 👏 you 👈 stand in the center of 💦🅱 the 🙆😳 arena, you 😫 will 💎✊ take 👀👀 over 💯🚫 twice the 👄💦 amount of damage as 🍑🏿 the side. ⏩👳
        - This 😂🙎 also is 😯👏 the 👉🤣 special attack 🤼 needed to brand the 💰 Royal Crossbow.
