> **Introduction**
.tag:intro
Solo Nex is a great way to make GP. It's the boss where many people first learn to PvM and make money to buy better gear. Each kill is about 1.3 to 1.5m GP, at the time of writing, and the method described gives 19 to 20 KPH when performed optimally. Even if you are only half as efficient at first, it will still be good money, and give a chance to refine your rotations over time. Remember to adapt the gear and method to your own gameplay and limitations.

When Nex spawns for the first time in a custom instance it will be praying against mage for the majority of the kill, this is why range only kills are the meta for fast consistent kills. After every kill you will teleport out of the instance and re-enter in order to force Nex to always be praying mage. This is why 2 presets will be required for the boss, one to get to Nex bank and one for the actual fight.

Nex is a 1x1 NPC and posses very strict softcaps, which mean that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase. During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above **5,000 by 50%**. For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage. On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above **2,000 by 75%**. This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000.

.
Nex's mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%. Each mage is combat level 111 with 10,000 health, possesses a max hit of around 850, and are weak to bolts. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name. An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks. Cruor's attacks always have 100% accuracy and will heal him for 100 damage regardless of the damage he deals, while Glacies' attacks can freeze players if they aren't using Protect/Deflect Magic; keeping the prayer active will result in all of her attacks missing regardless of the player's armour rating.

It is strongly advised to complete the Ritual of the Mahjarrat quest in order to get access to the Jas boost which gives a 5% damage boost in GWD1 (including Nex). This can be done via Fairy ring code D.K.Q.

**__Banking Preset__**

The most important thing is to have the key + ancient ceremonial for use with your boss portal

**__Beginner Preset__**
<:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> at start and on blood phase.  Disruption in Ice Prison at least
Akrisae body has clearheaded 3, and is used to build with escape at start. This method relies on ruby bolt procs on Nex.  However, around Ice phase, ruby bolt procs start to hit less than the ability they are replacing, so it’s optimal to bring a bolt switch.  It is generally preferred to camp ruby until ice phase, then switch to dragonstone bolts.

Quiver contains <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> and the shield has clear headed 3. It is recommended to use lunars for <:disrupt:535614336207552523> during Zaros phase and <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> start and on blood phase

> **Mechanics**
.tag:mechanics
Nex has 5 phases; Smoke, Shadow, Blood, Ice, and Zaos. Each phase has 2 special attacks, with the exception of Zaros

__**Smoke phase:**__
Virus → 5 auto-attacks → No escape → Five auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Don't stand in middle crossways or adjacent to partner 

__**Shadow phase:**__
Shadow traps (only if the phased before the virus attack) → Darkness → Shadow traps → 4 auto-attacks → Repeats from the second set of shadow traps
⬥ Move from shadows and don’t stand md

.
__**Blood phase:**__
Siphon summon → 3 auto-attacks → Blood sacrifice → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ Attacks during siphon will heal Nex and sacrifice will heal nex if not phased and in range
⬥ Any bleeds used during this phase will heal Nex rather than damage her ( <:frag:535541273755385885> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> <:deadshot:535541307666595870> )

__**Ice phase:**__
First special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Second special attack (based on phase start) → 3 auto-attacks → Repeat
⬥ If blood phase ended with sacrifice, ice will start with contain
⬥ If blood phase ended with siphon, ice will start with prison
⬥ Run from contain and freedom + eat up prison

.
__**Zaros phase:**__
⬥ Upon the start of this phase, Nex activates Turmoil and heals herself for 33,333 (1/6) of her health to boost it up to 73,333.
⬥ Nex does not have any unique special attacks in this phase and uses only her melee and magic autoattacks

> **Rotations**
.tag:rotations
**__Pre-Fight__**

**Make sure to use jas boost**

Target Fumus ASAP and start building adrenaline with defensives. Freedom should be first, and Anticipate should be last. Spam click the minion as sometimes when you escape, you won't get adrenaline from anticipate if you don't keep clicking the minion before escape.

.
**__Smoke Phase__**
Auto → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:frag:535541273755385885> (Walk backwards) → DW <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snap:535534127131394088> 

__Smoke Phase Notes__
1. Vuln bomb right before the kill is about to start.
2. Make sure to Rapid Fire with Ascensions so that there's a chance to proc the ruby bolt effect.
3. If the boss doesn't phase, follow up with <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088>, and run the boss while you do so.

Use good basics to kill the minion, starting with corruption shot. Save Frag shot for Nex
.
**__Shadow Phase__**
1. Tag with <:frag:535541273755385885>  and walk under during phase. 
2. During the phase, <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> .
3. Spam click Nex to get a lossless auto and then DW <:rapid:535541270521708566> 
4. <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088> 
5. Adjust as needed

__Shadow Phase Notes__ 
1. If you proc a ruby bolt special during rapid, needle into snap without snipe.
2. Reprisal isn't necessary, but makes it easier when you don't get a ruby bolt spec.

Both bleeds then good basics on the minion.

.
**__Blood Phase__**
1. Phase Nex ASAP to prevent the bleed. 
2. <:Vuln:537349530551582720> if you have it 
3. Charge <:snipe:535541258425204770> to Prephase (this will take practice to time)
4. DW <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dazing:535541307142307860> (Surge from Red)
5. If the boss isn't phased on surge, do <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> / <:needle:535541259108876293> / Thresh

__Blood Phase Notes__
1. Practice your Snipe timing so that it hits right when Nex is attackable, rather than healing her.
2. Make sure to surge from the red. This timing should be mastered and is essential to blood phase.
3. If you don't get a ruby proc, you'll probably need to go back for a snipe.
4. Don't get discouraged! Even experienced PvMers find this phase hard. If you need to, tele out and keep practicing. You'll get it down.


Both bleeds, good basics. If Nex is MDing you, it's worth it to run her to stall autos, but don't worry too much if she does another siphon before you can phase.

.
**__Ice Phase__**
`Contain first`
Auto → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Run from Contain) → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> (tag minion ASAP)
`Prison first`
1. Run to max attack distance and phase with dazing shot if you have an SGB (This is not super important). <:anti:535541306475151390> during the phase and eat a lot of jellies and grests to get to full HP.
2. <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:Reprisal:513190159462694912> prison → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> / <:mds:535541259033378827> 
3. Even without reprisal, it's not a big deal if you do the rest of the rotation correctly. 

Double bleed + good basics on minion again. Eat lots of jellies and grests. Try to <:frag:535541273755385885> first. Tag Nex ASAP to phase to Zaros.

.
**__Zaros Phase__**
You can run Nex if low on food, but don't need to (and will end up walking book procs). It's optimal to do so if you notice her SS is active.
<:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:deadshot:535541307666595870> → <:dazing:535541307142307860> → <:needle:535541259108876293> → <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> → <:dazing:535541307142307860> → <:needle:535541259108876293> → 5 tick Auto → <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> 
The boss should be dead at this point, congrats!

__Zaros Phase Notes__
1. Bleed used first on the minion can be used twice in Zaros (This is why Frag should be first)!
2. Rapid before deadshot. If rapid is on cooldown, try to use it earlier in ice phase. It should be OFF CD.
3. The 5 tick auto is done for the following reasons:
    - It's more damage than using a junk 100%
    - It's less ticks than a junk 100%
    - You could Snipe in the rotation and frag would come off CD on tick, but are hitcapped so snipe will do less damage per tick.
4. If it's low HP you can 5 tick Auto into rapid fire instead of into bleed.

.
**__Last Thoughts from <@!593106625955495947> __**
1. Practice. It took me a long time to pvm well.
2. If you have questions, ask someone who is better, but try to figure it out first. 
3. If you lack gear, skill, or damage, keep practicing and don't give up.
4. If you're a learner, try to at least understand what's going on, even if not everything makes sense.
5. These abilities will not always be the ones used, as not every kill goes as planned. Learning to adapt will result in improvement as a PvMer.

__**Eldritch Crossbow Rotation (Credit to <@!333479049680650241>):**__ 

**__Pre-Fight__**

**Make sure to use jas boost**

Target Fumus ASAP and start building adrenaline with defensives. Freedom should be first, and Anticipate should be last. Spam click the minion as sometimes when you escape, you won't get adrenaline from anticipate if you don't keep clicking the minion before escape.

**__Smoke Phase__**

__Smoke Phase Notes__
1. If you're using <:ingen:641339234111848463> , activate it and then vuln. This timing can be tricky, but will be easy with practice. You can vuln with a range weapon equipped.

.
**__Shadow Phase__**
1. Tag with <:frag:535541273755385885>  and walk under during phase. 
2. <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> (if no book proc) → <:snap:535534127131394088>

.
**__Blood Phase__**
1. Phase Nex ASAP to prevent the bleed. 
2. <:Vuln:537349530551582720> if you have it (You will only have time to vuln once)
3. <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:mds:535541259033378827> if needed

__Blood Phase Notes__
1. Practice your Snipe timing so that it hits right when Nex is attackable, rather than healing her.
2. Make sure to surge from the red. This timing should be mastered and is essential to blood phase.

Use good basics to kill the minion, starting with corruption shot. Save Frag shot to phase Nex.

.
**__Ice Phase__**
`You should ideally phase into contain first`
1. Tag with <:frag:535541273755385885>  and walk under during phase.
2. <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:snipe:535541258425204770> (Run from Contain) → <:snap:535534127131394088> (tag minion ASAP)

__Ice Phase Notes__
1. If you get prisoned before targeting Glacies you can target cycle to attack him
2. To walk your frag shot pre phase, you can either walk under Nex during phasing or surge to glacies out of max distance so nex walks the frag

Use good basics to kill the minion, starting with corruption shot. Save Frag shot to phase Nex. Tag Nex ASAP to phase to Zaros.

.
**__Zaros Phase__**
You can run Nex if low on food, but don't need to (and will end up walking book procs). It's optimal to do so if you notice her SS is active.
Tag with <:frag:535541273755385885> → <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:mds:535541259033378827> → <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> → <:deadshot:535541307666595870> → <:mds:535541259033378827> 
The boss should be dead at this point.
