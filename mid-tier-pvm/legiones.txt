.tag:intro
Legiones are bosses in 📥👏 the 💩👏 Monastery of 👏 Ascension. Accessing them ♀ requires an Ascension Keystone. They ✨ each 👏👏 have 🔵😒 a 👌 unique 👌 mechanic which are 🙏♀ detailed below. 😫 As ascension members, Legiones can 🔫💦 only ☝ be 🐝💎 efficiently harmed with 😍❌ ranged, as 🏿 they 👉👏 have 🍆 extremely ☣ low 📉 affinity against 😏 magic 📿 and ✊👏 melee attacks.

.
They 👨👥 are 👌 very good 👌 for 🎅👨 learning 🤗🤗 how 👹 to 💦 move 😎 around 🔹✈ and 👏 avoid 🙅🙅 mechanics 💰💰 while 🤔 still 🚸⏰ doing damage.

**__General__**
As ascension members, 👦 Legiones can only ☝👏 be 🐝 efficiently harmed with ranged, as 🅰 they have 😩 extremely low ⬇ affinity against 👉😤 magic and 🏻 melee attacks. They 👥 take 💩 increased damage the closer 😏 the player 🎮🤷 is 😮 to 🍆🚻 them 😀 which 🎓 is why ⁉❓ it is ❔ recommended to try 😥😐 to stay ✋ close 😜😜 to 👁👏 the legio during 🏃🚣 the 👏👉 fight.

.
**__Primus__**
⬥ Legio Primus' unique ability 👉👉 is 🙀 that the 👏🥖 lower 😎 life 😂❤ points 😘👁 he 👨 has, 💰 the ➡ more 🍗⚠ damage ☄☄ he will 🅱👏 deal.
    • For 🅱 every 😰👆 25% life 💓🤔 points that 👆👌 Primus loses, his 😵 lightning ⚡ orb attacks gain 💪🔼 200 extra 🗣 damage.

.
⬥ Using 🤳📤 the 📩😼 hit-and-run 👏🏼 tactic as normal 🖖🖖 nullifies this ability, 👉👉 however it 🍆 is 😜 best 🏆 to 🏼 eat 🍲😜 up 👀☝ as 🏿👦 being 🔜 caught 🐾 in 😩 the 🔥 middle of a 👌 lightning ⛈⛈ attack ⚔ can ♂😉 cause 💋🎗 massive damage.

.
**__Secundus__**
⬥ Legio Secundus' unique ability 👉 is 💦 using 🤳🤳 the ➡😫 lightning ⛈🌩 orb attack 🤼 more frequently as 🍑 his life points 💯 lower. 😤
    • At 75% health, ⛑ he 👁⛈ will 👏👫 use 👏✊ three orb attacks, then one ☝ basic 😀🌑 magic attack.
    • At 😎 50%, 👏👏 he 🏃🚹 uses 🆒 a simple 💁🌲 magic 📿✨ attack 🤼 every 🅰 four 🎧👱 orbs, and 👏👏 at 25% 👏 he ❓🅱 will 👏 exclusively attack 🤼 with lightning. ⚡⛈

.
⬥ This is 👎🙀 generally not a problem 👨👏 as using 🤳🤳 the 😫 hit-and-run 👊 tactic as 😐🍑 normal 🖖🖖 will nullify this 😷 ability, however 💯 the lightning 🌩⛈ orbs will 🐼 be 🐝 more ➕ frequent so having 🍽 high life points is advantageous when 😂😩 most of his 💊 are 🏻 depleted. 🛒🛒

.
**__Tertius__**
⬥ Legio Tertius' unique ability 👉 is 💦 summoning Monastery of 🕯💦 Ascension units as his 👿🎀 health 💉 lowers
    • 3 💯 Rorarii, 1 Gladius and ➕ 1 💸📐 Capsarius when 😩 he 👨 reaches 75%, 50% 👌 and 💦💰 25% 👏👏 of 🍌 his health 💉 respectively.

.
⬥ The 👑 ascended spawn under ⬇👎 Tertius, so they will 🅱 can be 🐝🐝 damaged easily with 👏⛹ Corruption Shot 🔫🔫 and 😱👏 Bombardment.
    • The 🙅 Gladius can 🔫 be 🐝 somewhat problematic, but 🍑 since Legiones take increased damage ☠☄ the 💛😦 closer the player 💰 is to ⏱💦 them, 😊😂 the Gladius is 💦👏 unlikely to move ☝☝ out ⏩ from 😮💋 Corruption Shot and 👨💯 Bombardment will only 😠🏦 force 👊 him 😠👩 to ♂♂ move 😎🏃 away from the pile.
    • Should 🈶 the 👏👴 Gladius be able to land 💯 a stun, immediately 💰 use 👏 Freedom and 🚫🏻 quickly 🆘 move 🔛 away before 🔙 the 😂✈ lightning ⛈🌩 attack 🤼⚔ strikes. 👏

.
*Note: Any remaining minions after Tertius is killed will die.*

.
**__Quartus__**
⬥ Legio Quartus' unique ability is 😤💦 teleporting the 😠 player 💰 next 😽 to ✌♻ him 😔 when he 😡🔵 reaches 75%, 50% and 25% 👏 life 🤔😎 points ❤🔢 and 🍆 launching 🚀 an 🔥 additional lightning attack at/around 🍆 the spot ⬅🏠 he 🏽😋 teleported the 👏👏 player, 💰🎮 on 🔌 top of 🏫💦 his 💦 regular 😶😶 attacks.

.
⬥ Quartus is the only ☝👏 Legio where 🤷 damage should 👍 be dealt carefully, 👌👌 as 🍑👏 his 👉💦 ability can 🔫👀 punish ⛓💢 fast 🏃 DPS players. 💰
    • If 🏿 the 😮 player damages him too 😔 fast, ⚡⚡ then 🍆😝 Quartus will 🎬👏 pull the 🚪 player back ❌ to the ♂ same spot 💗⬅ when 🍑 he 👏 first 🥇🥇 triggers his 🅱💦 ability, 👉 resulting in 🏻⚓ two immediate lightning strikes 👏👏 dead-center 🐩 which will 💯 quickly 🆘 shred a 👌👌 player's 🤷♀ health 💉 if 👏👌 Devotion is 🔮 not 🚫 used.
    • Quartus' drag 😛😪 is 🙀😩 unique 👌 compared to other 😂 monsters - Freedom and 💰💻 Anticipation do 🤞 not ❌ work, as 🍑 it isn't classified as 🖇 a 🏿 stun attack.
        - The pull also 😨➕ grants him a 😍 second of invulnerability, and any 🚸💦 channeled abilities used 🏭🆒 when he drags the player 🏋 are 🏻💓 simply ⤵⤵ put 😏😏 on 🔛🔛 hold 👫 for 🤔 the same time, after 👀 which 🙌👏 it 👂 is ☝ cast as 💰💰 normal again. 😠
    • This ⤴😤 is 👊 a 💰 very dangerous 💀 mechanic and makes 💘🌽 Quartus the 😫📖 most deadly 😈 of the 💞 Legiones.

.
**__Quintus__**
⬥ Legio Quintus' unique 👌 ability 👉👉 is 🤡😯 summoning "Lines of 👏 Ascension" in 🕺👤 the laboratory when 😂😂 he 🍆🔑 reaches 75%, 50% 🔫 and 25% 👏👏 life 💋💓 points.
    • The 👦 first and 👏 third 🤔 lines 📈➖ he 👉🙀 summons will 😳 run horizontally, while 🤔 the 👩✊ second 🅾 line 👦 runs 💰 vertically.
    • Accidentally running into 😂👉 lines 📈➖ and getting 🍆 caught by orb attacks can 🔫👀 easily 😊😂 kill 💀💀 a 💰 player 🤺💰 regardless 🤷 of 💦 experience. 💰

.
⬥ Stepping on one 🤖 of these lines ➖ will deal incredibly heavy damage ☄☠ (more 💹➕ than 😽😽 the 👏 lighting strike in terms of individual 🥖🥖 damage) - however, 🖐 it 👌 only 🏼 hits 🎯💥 once 🅱💦 each 👏👏 time 🕐 the 💦 player 🎮💰 runs 💰💰 into 🍐 a 🙏🚬 line, but due 👅👅 to the lightning orb attacks, you'll be forced to move 🏼 regardless.

.
⬥ It 🔫😂 is 💦 worth 💵💰 noting that the ㊙ player 📅🎮 can 🔫 "force" 🏼 the 👏☺ lines ➖ to ♀🔎 spawn as 🏿🅱 when 💦🕐 he 👨 reaches 75%, 50% ⏳👏 and 👏🔙 25% 👏 life 💼🏻 points 😍 respectively, a 👌 line will 😳♀ spawn wherever the 🤓🍬 player 🎮🎮 is ❓ currently. 🚟🚟 Doing this near 😯 the 👄👏 edges of 💦 the 🌛⬇ laboratory will 🍡👏 effectively nullify them 🎈 if 👏👻 they 🏼📚 perform ☝ the 👏🅱 hit-and-run 👊👊 tactic while ⌛🕗 keeping away ♀🏃 from 👊👩 them completely - however, players should 🤔💘 note 📝🎵 that 😐 he 🚹 will 💍 take 👏 less 📉〽 damage ☠☠ the ➡👏 further 💰🤔 you are 🔢🚫 from him, 😂 so 🌃 this 👏 is 😧🎃 only recommended for 💯 inexperienced players. 🎮🎮

.
*Note: the Lines of Ascension" are extremely similar to the Queen Black Dragon's fire walls - if you stand next to a line, then run over it, you will not take any damage from the line itself. This can allow for easier maneuverability around him to deal maximum damage without having to bring him closer.*

.
**__Sextus__**
⬥ Legio Sextus' unique ability 👉👉 is 😍🤔 his 🏻⚖ lightning ⛈⚡ attacks - unlike the 🍗 other Legiones, his 😵👀 attacks are not modified as his 🏻 health 💉 decreases.

.
⬥ Sextus' lightning ⛈ attacks last 🏋⏳ significantly longer than 😽👉 his 💯 fellow 😍😂 Legiones, as 💦🍑 they ⬅ only 👅 start 🅱🎮 to 🌈 dissipate once 🔂😩 three 💁💁 strikes 👏👏 are on 🔛 the 👏 field. In 💆 addition to 💯💦 the increased duration of 🌾😎 these 💦 attacks, their AoE is 🕛🕰 increased from 4x4 to 💰 5x5.

.
⬥ This 👈 should 💘 be 💰 kept 🤛 in mind 👌💪 while running 🏃 around; doing 📌 so in 📥 an 👏🤗 erratic way 🚘 is 🏼🈁 not ♂😨 advised as 🍑 the 🅱 larger radius and 🏽 prolonged duration can 🔫🔫 potentially slow 😳 down 😩 kills, 💀💀 though 👉 his laboratory is 🤔✅ fairly large to avoid 🙅 these 🤤🐭 attacks while 💯🕗 dealing 🚬 as much damage ☄☠ as possible. Sextus is 👐🎃 fairly easy ❓ to 💦 kill, 💞🔫 much like 🅱😄 Primus and ✊ Secundus.

.
> **__Basic Strategy__**
.tag:basic
Simply 😡😡 get 👌♀ into MD of 💦😳 the boss (this 👈 is 🕰😩 due 👅👅 to 👌🦊 you 👉 doing 📌📌 more 😢 damage ☄ the 👑 closer 😏😏 you 😩 are), double bleed 😳💉 and 🍆😍 walk 🚶 your 🏻 fragmentation shot. 🔫 Then, 😠🙈 do your ♀🍆 best 🐔🏼 range threshold 🤝 rotation (i.e. 👍🕵 Snapshot 📸📸 and 👖 Rapidfire; avoid 🙅🙅 Shadow Tendrils as 🕐🅱 Legiones have 😤😤 a 📢💰 hit cap of 7.5k). ⏰ Finish the 👨 kill 👻 with 🕺 basics. Ideally, kill 🚬 times should 💘 be consistently sub 😤👦 20 🔳 seconds.

.
> **__Manipulating Attacks__**
.tag:mani
A more ➕ advanced technique worth discussing is 💦😳 the 👑 ability 👉 to manipulate where legiones will 👏🍡 drop 😻 their lightning ⛈⛈ balls. 🍒⚪ This 🅱😕 involves abusing 👏👏 the 🎅 fact 🏫 that 😭 their 🤡⬅ mechanics are based on where 😾🤕 you ❔👈 click, 🖱🖱 and the 👏 fact 🛡📓 that 😐 movement can 👍🔝 be 🐝😡 stopped by using 🏻🏻 an ability. 👉 

.

This 👈😑 method can 🔫🔫 result in 👌 around ↪ 240-250 KPH and 👏 around 200 KPH at 👉 Quartus

**__Rotations__**
The 👏 rotation remains ♂ fairly similar 👱👱 between 👈🖕 each 👏👏 boss 👴 but ❌ is slightly adapted to 💦 account 💳💳 for 🎁 the 😩🏻 mechanics 💰 of the different 🏼 Legiones.
Cycle between 🍼➡ Kill 💀☠ 1 and 🍼🥜 Kill ☠👻 2 of each boss 🏽 to 😀 allow 🎫 for cooldowns. Expected 🍆😂 kill times 🍆 should 👫 be 🐝🅱 around 🐋↪ 9-11 💲 seconds.

**__Navigating the Lines of Ascension at Quintus__** 
⬥ Quintus can 🔫 be one ☝🤔 of 🍆🐶 the most 🐶🦁 dangerous 😱☠ Legiones when 🍑 first ☝ starting out but 👩 there's 😑👈 a way 🐩 to completely 😍😍 avoid the lines of 💦💦 Ascension by 😈😈 placing the lines at 👉🍆 certain times 😭😭 and moving on 😁 specific ticks.

⬥ The 😼 diagram below 😫 shows where 😾🛐 to 💦 stand 💨🚶 on 😂 which 🥙 phases and 🏽 the ticks to 💦 run 🏃 can 🔫 be ❌ found 🔎👁 within the Advanced ⚛ Quintus rotation.

⬥ This ⬆👉 placement of 💦💦 course applies to 💋 non 🚫🏆 advanced methods but 🙅🙋 you 👍👆 will 💣🙈 have 😣👏 to adapt to ✌✌ the 😢🍤 phasing hp rather than 😻🅰 knowing ☣☣ exactly which tick to 🔵💦 move 😎🏃 on 🤺🔛 due 👅👅 to 📬 you 👨🐶 dealing lower damage.
