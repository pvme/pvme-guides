.
**__Room 1__**
Lure Slimes to 💦💨 AoE them, 😂 kill 💀🔫 4 to 💰 proceed.

.
**__Room 2__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> to the staircase to avoid aggroing Spiders and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> on the edge of the wall, kill 3 Red Dragons to proceed.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/yEnnDjN.png
.
**__Room 2.5__**
Walk around the wall back into the Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> you placed earlier and finish your rotation. If you have Slimes following you, you need to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> past the Red Dragons and they will get blocked behind them. Slimes get blocked very easily which can be utilized multiple times throughout the section.

.
**__Room 3__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the back of the bridge and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>. You only need to kill around 3 Golems to proceed but you can catch them all in aoes very easily.

.
**__Room 4__**
The optimal way 😲🚘 to do this 🎁🖖 room 🚹🏗 depends 🤔🔁 on 🔛 the positioning of 💦 the 👄🍆 Slimes and 🚟 books 😎😎 right as the ⏰ barrier goes 🚋 down. 😤 
⬥ If you are immediately aggroed by multiple Slimes and Books: Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> and clear them from the bridge. 
⬥ If you draw only Slime aggro, look to Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> behind the Celestial (slimes will get blocked). You must kill the Celestial + several Slimes to pass this room so if you draw no aggro at all you must manually tag some slimes to bring behind the celestial.

.
**__Room 5__**
90% of the time you will have extra enemies following you from the previous room so Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> past the 3 Celestials and sun at the back of the room (extra books, slimes, golems will be blocked). Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> there and clear the Celestials. You can use Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> for the dragon.

.
**__Room 6__**
Deal damage as normal, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> if you'd like

.
*Note: Room 6 actually occurs after Astellarn.*

This 💦👈 fight 💥♂ heavily 💦😃 utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics 💰 but 🙅🍑 is 🌈 still 🙌💢 very 👍🏽 straightforward and easy ‼♂ to 😱 master 🥇 with some practice. 🍆🍆 Tag 🔞🔞 Astellarn to 😱 start 🏁🎮 the fight 💥 and 👉 begin 📦 DPSing. After 🅰👀 2-3 autoattacks a 🎁 Pulsar will 👏 spawn with 💰👀 20,000 🔳 hitpoints, dealing 🚬👦 moderate periodic damage. Ideally, you 👈🔥 would ❓ want 🚶 to have 🍳👏 saved ✝🆘 either 🌻♂ Wild Magic 📿 or 💰🚨 Asphyxiate to 🚶 kill ☠ this 💯 as 🍑 quickly ⏰ as 💰 possible. 🔝🔝 Shortly after, a bar will 🎧 appear ‼ above 👆👆 the 🍗👨 player's 🤺 head and ☑ a 👌 wyrmhole will 🏼🙋 spawn at their current location when ⏰ it 😶 fills. Place ❤ the wyrmhole along 🔚 these 🤤 lines ➖ to prevent 🚫🚫 it 💯🏻 from being blocked out by 👏🌈 the 😮👧 later rain mechanic. 

.img:https://i.imgur.com/DL8fq7i.jpg

.
When the 🏻 wyrmhole spawns, 🤑 it will deal continuous damage ☄ to anyone 👥♀ standing 🔪 in 😋😤 it. 😍✋ Step 👞👉 away ♀😱 and 💦🍟 continue 💰🔕 dealing 🏾👦 damage ☠ until the 👏 Neutron 😂 Star spawns. This 👈🤖 will follow 👣 the player around 🌐🕤 and 👏 must 👍 be lured into the 😱 wyrmhole. If the 👊 Neutron 👌😂 Star touches ✋👏 a player, it will explode, dealing 🚬🚬 5000 damage ☠ and 🙆 it 😼 is highly 🌿 recommended to 💦💦 teleport out 💷 and 💯🏻 restart the 👩 fight in 🐩👏 this ☝ case. 🤔💯 The wymhole will become stabilized and 👏 turn 👏 white 😋⚪ if 😳 this 👈 mechanic is 🕤 dealt with properly, 🏁👸 allowing you 🍆👈 to ✌ stand 🕺🕴 in 📥 it and deal increased ➕ damage to 💦 Astellarn for 🍆 it's 😫 duration. Use Sunshine 🌞 inside 💠 of it 💯 and do as 🍑🖕 much 😩 damage as 🕘 possible. 🔝🔝 A 🎁👌 good 👍 DPS rotation can 👏 kill Astellarn before 😩 the 🔥 end ✋🛑 of 💦🅱 the 🏡 first 😎😎 wyrmhole.

The celestial rain ☔ will begin 📦 once 🏳☝ the 👀🏋 boss reaches 200,000 hitpoints. This 🙄 will 👏 spawn a continuous rain 💦 in 😩 a random quadrant that 💦😝 deals increasing damage ☄☠ as 😱 long 🕛 as 🕑💯 it is 🎃 stood in. This 👏👀 will 💦⚽ change 🔀 quadrants occasionally 🐶 and will 😩🏾 only 👏😫 be a 🆒🕓 major issue if the 🍆🖖 wyrmhole was placed improperly.

From here on, these mechanics repeat 🔂🔂 with the 🗣🖱 rain 🌧 lasting for the remainder of 😍 the encounter.

**__Room 1__**
Spider aggro can be a nuisance here, Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> immediately east here and depending on how many spiders come along you may need to clear them first. Clear the two Lava Strykes at the end to proceed.
.
If 👏 lots ☑ of 👸💰 aggro is 🔮⚠ drawn, stand 🕺 here 😶🔪 to 💦 stack. 📚

.
**__Room 2__**
Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> in the middle of the Black Dragons and clear them.

.
**__Room 3__**
Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> to the end of the path while killing the Dragons and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> when it comes up, you need to kill every Black Dragon here to proceed

.
**__Room 4__**
You must kill 4/6 Lava Strykes to proceed, Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the end of the path right next to the barrier to clear the last two.

.
**__Room 5__**
Your Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> from the previous room will still be ongoing to clear the 3 Black Dragons at the start, build to 100 at the last Dragon at the end of the path in preparation for Verak Lith.

This 👈 boss 💼☝ fight ♂ follows 🏃♀ a 💰👌 very predictable attack ⚔ rotation but 🍆🍑 deals consistent moderately high ☝ damage so it is 🔥 recommended to 📬 learn 📚📚 the 📅 few 🔛 mechanics 💰💰 properly to 💦 avoid any unnecessary deaths. It 💸💯 will 🐼 always 💯🕔 melee auto 🤖 attack when 🍆👌 the player 👨 is 👏😂 in melee distance and 💰🍆 always mage otherwise. The 🔴👩 auto 🤖🤖 attacks hit 😎🔞 quite 💬🅰 hard 🍆 and 👀 specifically the mage ones are 😬🏿 desynced visually so it 😠 is 💦 important to ➡ not ♀ mess 💦💦 up 😍⬆ too 🤖 many 🍺🤗 prayer flicks here. ♂👏

.
**__Verak Lith's Attack Rotation__**
4 Auto 🤖 attacks → Spire → 4 🍆 Auto 🤖🤖 attacks → Ricochet → 4 💦 Auto 🤖 attacks → Spire → 4 😂👨 Auto Attacks → Nosedive/Hurricanes → Repeat 🔂🔂

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Spire**: The message 🗞💁 "Verak Lith slams 👊👊 his 💦🍬 tail 🐒🍆 against 🚫 the ground, 👇 the 👴 earth 🌎 shakes beneath 👇 your 👉 feet!" will ♀ appear ⁉ and after 🅱👀 a 👏 short delay and ➕ spire with ♀ 15,000 💵 hp will spawn near 😯 the player. The 👽 boss 😎 will be immune to 😂 damage ☠☠ while 🤔♀ the spire is alive so 💯😎 it 🤔 is 🤔 good to threshold to ♂ get 😩 it 💦🏿 down 🏽⬇ immediately. 💰 The 👏👉 spawn will also ✅ be 👏🔹 accompanied by a moderate melee hit that 💸 can 🔫 be resonanced. In a typical kill, 😛 this will 👌 be 👎 the 🏻 primary method alongside soul split flicking to 🅱 restore hp.

.
⬥ **Ricochet**: Verak Lith will send 📱💌 out 😎 a 🏽 projectile that lands at 😂 a 🚓👏 spot around the 🅱🌫 player ♀🤷 after 👀 a few seconds. The element of 💰💦 this ⬆😞 projectile can be 😒🤘 poison, 🤒🤒 ice, ❄ or 🏻 shock, 😨😨 and 👀 corresponds with 😣 the three 🏾 groups of 💦💦 eggs 🍳 found around 🔹 the 👦 arena. The 🙏 correct way ↕✋ to 💦 deal with 👉💦 this 📥 mechanic is to pick 🤗⛏ up 👀❤ the projectile and interact 💦 with a DIFFERENT 💰 type 📝📝 of 🌈 egg to disperse it before 👉😈 the 🏋👉 bar 🍻🥃 fills up. 🆙 Missing 💨 the projectile will 💍 deal 4000 damage ☠ and 😖 missing the 😮 dispersal can 🔫 deal 9000+ damage ☠☄ so 🔫 it ⚕🤕 is 💦🕛 especially 😈 important 😍 not 🚫🙅 to 🏻🎲 miss 🏻 the 💪 second half of 💦 this 👈🔽 mechanic. Generally, 😄👀 if ⚖🅱 the 🌷 projectile matches the element of 👏 the ⤴👏 nearest group 👥🅱 of 💦😊 eggs to 🎀 the ❤ player, 🏋💰 it 💯 should be ignored 😒 with disruption shield, debilitate, or 💰👉 reflect (or 🍆 nothing 🔫👏 if the 🏥🥗 player is 🏻👎 high ☣ hp). This ♂ will 👊 end the 💩🦁 mechanic early. 🕐🕐

.
⬥ **Nosedive**: A message 📩 will 💩♀ appear on 👏👋 the 💦💯 screen 🖥 mentioning that 🤢😤 a dragon 🐉 is 👅 nosediving. An ⬅ arrow 💘 will 🏿 show up 🏻 near 😯😯 the ⚔ player 💰 to indicate the direction the 🎅 dragon is approaching from 💥💥 and, after 🕑👀 a 🎉🎁 short delay, a 💯♀ thin 💃💃 line of dragonbreath will be 🐝🐝 fired 🔥🔫 along 💁💁 the 🏥 line 〰〰 the 👏 arrow is 🍎💦 pointing. This 👈 can deal over ⚠ 8000 magic 📿 damage and can 🅱💦 be 🐝🐝 avoided by 🎨🎨 simply moving out ♂😱 of 😤🔟 the way. ↕ However, the 📜💰 arrow 💘 will adjust it's 🌧 position based 🤰😲 on the 💰 player's 💰😤 movement for 😎🍆 a short period so it 😂😵 is recommended to learn the ⛓👑 timing on 👎 this 👇😋 mechanic and 👏😫 move 👊 as it 💯 goes 💦 off. 😝

.
⬥ **Hurricanes**: Verak Lith will 💍👏 say 😤😂 "Let 🙆👑 the 👶🏛 flames 🔥🔥 melt the 🏻 flesh from 👉👉 your 🌻👆 bones" and 🍆👅 engulf the 👏 area around ➡🕤 the player in 👆 fire. 🔥 This will deal no damage but after 🔜🏃 a 😍🖤 short 🕛⬇ delay, hurricanes will 🎬 spawn in 🏼👏 the 👏👏 area that deal extremely high damage and 💯🚫 last ♿ for roughly 20 🎊📊 seconds. This 📍👅 is 💦 a 📣 fairly large 😵 area attack 🤼⚔ and ☺ should 👑 be 😠 surged from 👉 to 😂💦 be 🐝 a safe distance away. 😜 It isn't very 👤 complicated however, simply ⤵⤵ don't 🙈 touch a 👓👌 hurricane.

Really straightforward just spam Dominion Mines <:dommine:662249620579155968> and Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at those spots, you can skip the two Onyx Dragons at the start and the 2 Hydrix Dragons in the middle

The Black Stone 🗿🗿 Dragon 🐉🐲 is 😤 the 🆘⚰ final boss 😎 encounter in the 👑🌫 Dragonkin 🐉 Laboratory and 🐨🏻 is 🤔🌈 the main source of the 👇👏 dungeon's ⛓➕ primary unique: Draconic Energies, which ✌ are 😎😠 used to 💸 make 🖕✋ the 👏💩 mage t92 Elite 👏👏 Tectonic set. It ♂💯 also drops 😲⬇ the 🏿🚟 Mutated Barge Codex, which 👏👏 sees 👀 frequent use 👏 in 🛌 endgame melee encounters. This fight 😠 consists of 😤 fairly simple mechanics but 🍑🍑 can 🔫💦 be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is 💢👏 also ✅➕ one of the 💖👏 few bosses to auto 🤖 attack in all 💯👉 three 🏾💁 combat 🏹🕰 styles, with melee hitting especially 🌟 hard, so 🍴 it is 💯😩 possible 🔝🔝 to die 🚦 just 💪 from 👉 auto 🤖 attacks if 👏🏾 the player 💰🎮 can't ♂🔫 outheal with 😗 soul split, 🚻 is 👊💦 low ⬇ on 🔛🔛 food, and/or can't ❗ prayer 🙏🏼 flick the 👏👏 fight.

.
**__Attack Rotation__**
⬥ **Phase 😶😶 1**
    • 3 😭😭 Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks → Gemstone Spikes → 2 Auto Attacks → Dragonbreath → Repeat 🔂🔂
⬥ **Phase 🌕 2** 🔆💦
    • Black 🏿◼ Hands
⬥ **Phase 3**
    • 1-5 💸⛈ Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks → Smoke Spiral → 3 Auto 🤖 Attacks → Mage AoE → 2 💦 Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks → Dragonbreath → Gemstone Spikes → 3 🔀😭 Auto 🤖🤖 Attacks → Mage AoE → Repeat 🔂🔂

.
**__Mechanics__**
⬥ **Gemstone Spikes**: This 🔽 mechanic occurs a few auto 🤖 attacks into 😩 the start 💯 of the 🚟 fight and 👏 after each dragonbreath after 👀 phase 🌕🌕 1. ⚖➡ This ❓ is 😳👏 identical to 🆒 the hydrix dragon 🐲🐲 special 😂👋 attack ⚔🤼 where 😠🛐 a line of 💥🌈 spikes are shot 🔫😰 through ▶ the 👈 ground 👇📈 and erupt under ⬇⬇ the player. 🤷😤 This ⬆🚟 deals 5000+ melee damage ☠☄ and 👏 drains ⌛⌛ all adrenaline 💉💉 upon impact. It 💋🙂 will 🅱 also ➕ apply a debuff that 👨👉 reduces all 👩 adrenaline 💉💉 gain 🏿 by 👉 50% 👌👏 for ⌛🎁 a short ⬇🕛 duration. Simply ⤵😡 move ♀ out 🤔 of 🎖🔴 the way ↕↕ when this 👈👈 comes 💦💦 out.

.
⬥ **Dragonbreath**: The skybox will turn 🤔 dark 🔫 blue 👄 and Black 👨 Stone ☄ Dragon 🐉🐉 will 🌳💰 fire a 100% 💯💯 accuracy 👌 mage attack 🤼 that 😐 deals moderate damage. ☠☠ This ‼😂 is 👏 essentially just a 💰 mage auto 🤖 attack 🤼 that hits 💥 slightly harder 🍆🔨 but signals that 😤💵 the 🍃👏 spikes are 👆 coming 🏻 out immediately 😭 after 👀 (phase 🌘 3). 😘

.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Oa1qT6q.png
⬥ **Black ◼ Hands** (Phase 🌔😶 2): 🙊🏻 After 😡❌ reaching 👉 515k-500k hp, phase 🌗🌑 2 😂😳 will 👻 begin. 📦📦 This 👅😅 is 🅱🈶 signaled by 😈🏼 Black Stone Dragon moving to 💦 the center of the 👑⤵ arena and 4 👌 black ⬛ hands 😤🙊 with 80,000 hp each 👏 spawning where the rocks are 💯🏼 located. These 😱 hands 🙊🙌 will 😛🤔 slam the ground 🌄 regularly and 👏 send 💌 out 💯🌌 a 👌👌 very 👌 heavy 😔👆 mage auto 🤖 if they are 🚟🔢 in 😏↙ range of the 🕵 player. 🤺💰 Shortly after, a 👌🍕 line of 👶💦 small 👌🏼 hands will 💎⚽ move towards ⛪ the player that 2000+ 😨😮 damage ☄ if stood on. 🔛 These hands will 🏿💣 NEVER reach ✋ the 💦 player if 👏 they are standing 🔪🏿 in one of 👨💦 the 🌟 four ♂🏼 spots pictured above. 🔝 The 😼👏 phase 😶🌑 will end when 💦 all 4 😘 hands 👏 are dead, ☠💀 dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can 👍🔫 potentially use 👏 6 if 💯 you 💩 placed some during phase 🌘 1. ♂👀 

.
⬥ **Smoke 🚬🚬 Spiral**: A 🌼 line of 💦💰 smoke 🚬🚬 will spiral inwards towards Black 🏿 Stone 🗿 Dragon, 🐉 dealing 🚬🚬 4000+ damage per 👼👼 tick if 😩 stood on. 🔛 The 🤔 boss will ❓ remain 👀 stationary during 🚣 this 🌈 time ⌚🕐 so 💯 flanking is possible 🔝🔝 here. 💦😩 It is 🍆 recommended to 👁💦 learn where 🌎 you 👈 can 💁 stand 💨🕺 safely to 👅💰 avoid 🙅🙅 having to 🤑 cancel ❌❌ channeled abilities. Generally, 😄 a 🐝 max range 💦🤤 death 💀 swiftness to 💦 the 💊👉 sides of the boss 😂💼 will 💰👫 provide decent freedom of movement and ➗🔄 allow 🎫 for flanking.

.
⬥ **Mage AoE**: Black Stone Dragon 🐉🐲 will call out 👀💰 "GET. 🔫 OUT. OF. 😕 ME." 🤵😛 or "The shadow 👤 overwhelms!" and 👵 turn 🔁 to 💦 fire a 🏻🤕 black projectile towards ⛪⛪ a 😍 random 🎲🔀 spot 💓 in the 👏 arena. This is 👮😓 very 👿 similar 👱💯 to 👅 Verak Lith's hurricanes special ☄ and 🅱🏼 will 😜 explode into 🤣 black 👱👴 tendrils that 😍🚟 deal 4000+ damage in 😻 the 👆 area for 🚟📀 a 📢 short 👉👉 period. In a 👌💰 solo 😂🎸 encounter, this 👈👈 will 📃 miss most ☺ of the time 💪 and isn't a big 👨 concern. 😕😕 The 👏💬 boss can also ☹🙇 be 🐝🐝 flanked when 💕 it turns 💫 to send 📩 out 🐜😢 the special.

.
⬥ **Fly**: 🕊🐦 Upon 💰 hitting 😦😦 250,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon 🐲🐉 will 👏 become 🤦♂ invulnerable and fly around 💰😵 the arena, landing at 🍆👉 various spots and 🙏 sending out 💯➡ smoke 🚬 lines towards ⛪ the 😫 player 🤷💰 each 👏👏 time. 🕗 Additional lines will 🍑 also spawn out 💯 of 😱😤 existing ones 💚💯 on each 👏 land, so 👏🆙 movement can get 🙇 hectic if 🤔🤔 the 🐗 boss lands at 🚟👉 the 😂 same 💩 area multiple times. 😱🕓 This smoke 🚬🚬 is 😦😅 functionally identical to 💦♂ the 😊✊ type ⌨📝 in the spiral mechanic and should be 😱 avoided at 👸👸 all costs. This will 🍆 occur 7 times before the 🤣 boss 👴💼 becomes 📉📉 vulnerable again 😦🚫 and 👅 continues the ☝ phase 🌑🌗 3 rotation starting from smoke spiral. The lines ➖ will not 😠 spawn if 🏃 the 🚀 boss 🏻 lands out 💦🏎 of 👏 range 💦💦 but 🙅 it 😳😫 is 👏🏾 still 😽 highly 👾 recommended to follow 👣👣 and 〰 use 👏👏 an 🤔 ability after each landing as the boss will 💧😬 take 👩👆 longer 🕚 to fly ✈ again if 😩 the player 🏋 stays far 🌐👉 away. 😭
