**__Room 1:__**
Kill 💀 the 👏👏 mobs with what you 😍😊 have 🙋 available.

**__Room 2:__**
Run behind the 3 Scouts and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>. The scuttlers will MD you by the time it's charged. 

**__Room 3:__**
If you're on Ancients, you can Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> the line of Warriors and all the mobs in this room will be lined up for Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>.

.
**Example:** <https://youtu.be/bETOKmCEv6I>

**__Room 4:__**
There's only two Cloaked Zealots to clear here and they're lined up for AoEs so just do whatever you want here, Dragonbreath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> if you want to.
 
**__Room 5:__**
There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. Aggro the zealots and move back a few steps to stack the mobs together for AoEs. Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> may be used but is likely better for the next room. 

.
**Example:** <https://youtu.be/VYA1tj-7dqg>

**__Room 6:__**
⬥ The first set of Zombies will stack into your Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> if you charge it near the entrance rather than surging past them. 
    • You 👈 don't 🚫👎 want 👄😋 to 💦🙅 draw 🔙 aggro from 👉 the 👏 second 🅱 group early 🕐 as 😴 that 😐🕶 splits them up ❤ and makes 🤔💘 them 🎐♂ harder 😫 to 💰 AoE. 

⬥ Most if not all of the second set is quickly lurable into a Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>. 

**__Room 7:__**
Fairly small room, release Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> once all the NPCs are MD. 

**Example:** <https://youtu.be/h4Y3gEqJ6rg>

**__Room 8:__**
You 🔥💖 only need 🤤👍 to 👂 kill 👏👻 the two 🎄 Zealots here 😗👌 to use 🖐👏 AoE's and conserve your adrenaline 💉💉 for 🎛 the 😈👏 Leviathan.

.tag:crassian

.
As 🗻🍑 the 🏾 first 😌 boss 💼 of The Shadow 👤👤 Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has 🚸 a very 📈 small and easy ❓♂ set ✴ of 💦 area denial mechanics 💰 that 🏻❌ can 💁 deal a ♂💰 lot of 😤 damage if ignored. 😒😒 The boss 👨👨 will also 🙇 passively heal over the ⚔💻 duration of 👮👏 the 🌜♂ fight, 😫 although the 🌎 amount 🔢 is very negligible. Once 🔥🏳 you get 😬🔫 used 😏🏭 to the mechanics 💰💰 however, 😐 this 💯 fight ✊😡 should 💘 be extremely 💯🔞 consistent and 💰🏳 fast. 🚄⚡

__**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Poison pits + Additional heads:** 🙊 The 🌀 center of the arena is 🤚 filled 💦 with 😫😫 poison 🤒 and 🔫😩 is surrounded 💫👀 by 👏 the additional heads 🙈 of 👏 the 💲 leviathan. This 💯 area deals constant poison 🤒🤒 damage ☠☠ and makes 💘💘 the 📩👩 player 📅 vulnerable to 👪 long stun attacks that 💦 the 👉💰 heads can use. 👏👏 The 🔥🔥 player should never ❌🙅 stand ♂⛱ in this 🏋👉 zone ™ during 🏃 the 🏆💰 fight, 💥😠 making 🛠 this 😠👈 mechanic largely irrelevant.

⬥ **Dragon 🐲 Breath:** 😖 This 👈 will 🅱👏 always be the first 🥇 mechanic of the 👏🍆 fight and is 😅 signaled by 🍂😈 the ➡ Leviathan firing a stationary breath 🌬 attack 🤼🤼 in 😏 front 🔝 of 👪💦 it, dealing rapid heavy damage. ☠ Simply ⤵😡 stand off 👬😫 to the 🅱🔝 side to avoid 🙅 this. 👈😀 Afterwards, reposition in front 🔝 of 💦🌈 the boss 🏽 to 💦 avoid 🙅 being 😑😑 caught 🔍 in the next 🗓 mechanic.

.
⬥ **Head 😩 Sweep:** The leviathan will 🍆♀ slam its' head across the 🔯 ground twice, ✌ dealing 👦🚬 very heavy 😿 damage ☠☠ to 👈 anyone 👦 caught 🔍 in the ✨ area. This 😤 is 💦💯 avoided by 🚟 moving to 💦💦 the 🌊 opposite side ⛅😂 of 💦👏 where 🤕 the 👏👏 sweep begins. 🌟👉

⬥ After going through 🗺😍 one Dragon Breath 🌬 and two 💏 sets of 💦 Head Sweeps, the 🅿👏 Leviathan will 📃🏼 shortly move 🏃♂ to 💦 other 👴🕹 opposite 🔃♠ side of the 💦👦 arena, repeating his 👨🤔 previous rotation. 
    • Avoid entering the center here by Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> across the arena. 
    • Any bleed used will be considered 🤔 walked as 👦👦 this ☝ transition occurs. 

.
__**Strategy**__
Under a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, aim to fit 2 Asphyx's<:asphyx:535533833072672778>, Wild Magics <:wm:535533809978966037> and Deep Impacts <:deep:535533833139912724> and 1 Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>, dumping Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> as seen fit.

.
**__Room 9:__**
There ✔💦 is 🤔☝ a ⚾ Cloaked Zealot and 👏🍆 various Scuttlers in 👏📥 this 💧 room you 🤓🏃 need to 👏 clear 📝📝 to 💦 proceed. You can 💦🔫 generally 👀😄 stand 🚶🏾 behind the Zealot and the Scuttlers will MD you for 👨😩 AoEs. 

**__Room 10:__**
Put your salve amulet back on, there are very spread out Zombies in here that are fairly annoying to AoE as mage. Most of the time you can catch most of them in a Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> fairly quickly and then finish off the stragglers with your remaining abilities.

.
**__Room 11:__**
Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. There's not much to this room but focusing the Necromancer will clear the Skeletons in the AoE available, saving Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>  for the next room.

**__Room 12:__**
There are two Necromancers off at the sides and a line of three Armoured Zombies that stack up very well for a Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> guarding the door. You only need to kill one Necromancer and the Zombies to proceed to section 2, the temple area.

.
**__Room 1:__**
⬥ There 😩⛱ are 🐓🔥 two ✌ Ulthven Necromancers guarding the gates to the 👏 east 👉 and 🚫🍼 west that you 😀👼 must 👏 clear 📝🔎 to access 🚪 the 🎇👏 black ⬛◼ stone ☄😤 artefacts. The main gate 🚧🚧 will 😘👏 not 😅 drop until 🍆🍆 these 💦🍆 have been 👏 activated. 

⬥ A mass of summoned skeletons will form in the room as you go about this task, making it a very easy soul split opportunity with Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> before you proceed. 

**__Room 2:__**
⬥ This 👇 is 👐👏 the archer bridge where 👏 you get 👏💦 pelted with small ranged hits 💥 constantly. There 🆗🔫 are 😎 two Sea 🌊🌊 Horrors 💦 and a 👼 Necromancer at 😂👒 the 👏 end 🚫🔜 of this room 😭🏗 that 🚟♀ you 😡 must 💰 clear to 💦👌 proceed. 🚶 
    • The 😈👏 horrors 🍆 deal a 🏃 ton 💰 of damage so 🔥🙇 it's important ✅ to 👏 avoid 🙅 them by standing 🏿🏿 atleast at 💁👌 a 💰🚾 7sq range. 
    • Using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> and Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302> hits 10 stacks immediately here. 
    • Focus 🅱 on 💦 dealing 🏾 damage ☠☄ and ➕ you'll 👦✊ be 🐝 out 👀🅱 very quickly. 🆘⏰ 
    • Use AoE's under Revenge <:revenge:535541259645878302> for the best damage possible

.
**__Room 3:__**
There's a 🍇 line ☁🚫 of 💦🎆 three 👨🕛 Acolytes of 😤💦 Seiryu guarding the 👏 gate here 💪 that 😤👉 must 😠 be 💨🅱 cleared to 💰 proceed. 🚶🚶 They 😱 are melee and 👏🔙 line 🙋💨 up ☝ well 😂🤔 for 😩🏼 AoEs.

**__Room 4:__**
Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes and go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the Necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared.

.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is 🅱🏻 the second boss of 😜👬 the Shadow 👤👤 Reef, and is 🙀 a clear 📝🔎 step 👣👞 up in 🌍 difficulty 😤😫 from 💥➡ the 🔥🏿 first. He and 👎 his 🤔 Corpses are classified as 💰 Undead for 🔙 Salve Amulet, Undead Slayer perk ⏫⏫ and 👏 sigil purposes.
.
> __**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Rift of 💦🎆 Undeath** - A 👌👌 Rift of Undeath with 30K HP. This rift will 😜🍆 spawn a large 🏯😵 amount of 💦🔍 skeletons that 👉💰 each 👏👏 deal low 👏👏 amounts of 🏻 damage. ☠ After roughly 30 ✈✈ seconds, 😫🕚 it will explode, 💥 dealing heavy 🏔 damage ☠ to 🅱👏 the 🍒😜 player. 🏋👨 Should be killed before 🍆⬅ it detonates.

⬥ **Death's Swiftness:** - Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and 🙏🏽 Bloated Monstrosity:** - Upon 👉 reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will 🤔 become ♂ invulnerable and 🍒🏼 fly 🦋 towards one of 💰💦 the 🌊 two 💘✌ black 🖤 crystals at ❓👸 the 🏼 sides of the arena, healing himself 😎 and 🏳👏 spawning one 🔥☝ of 💦🤑 the 💯👏 two ✌ corpses: Corpse ⚰⚰ Carrier (west) or the 🅱 Bloated Monstrosity (east), 👉👉 with 👀 90K HP each. 
    • The Corpse Carrier will 🤔😜 continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive ☠♍
    • The Bloated Monstrosity increases 📄 the ⏲ damage ☠☠ of 🏫👨 Taraket's attacks. Both of 😂⛄ these 🖌 attack ⚔⚔ with 👏💯 melee and 🕰👏 are 🙏 very easy to kite 💇💇 if needed. 🤒 
    • Taraket can 👀💪 only spawn these 📀🤤 once each 👏 and 🏞👏 will not 😠🚫 heal upon 💰 hitting 200K HP afterwards. 
    • The first 🥇 spawn will always 🏻 be ☃🐝 the 👈☸ closest crystal 💎💎 to 💦💦 Taraket

⬥ **Spirit 🤗 Line:** - Taraket summons a line 🚫📉 of 💦⛄ spirits from 💰 a 🍦😾 random direction that 🙎 will move 🏼 towards ⛪⛪ the ☃ player, 💰 dealing 🏾 rapid typeless damage ☠ upon contact. 😑😑 This is 🏻😐 accompanied by a very 👌♀ strong melee hit to 😉👏 anyone 👧 standing directly ➡➡ in front 🔝 of 💦🌈 him. 😝 
    • Simply 😡 move out 😬 of 💦🤓 the way ↕ accordingly when 😩 this 👇⁉ happens and 🏼 don't 🙈🚫 stay 💤🚀 in 😈 front 🔝🔝 of the boss 😍 after the 🕵👏 two 🎄🎄 crystals have been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__
⬥ Start the fight with Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> and Escape <:escape:535541258832052231> to lure Taraket on top of his portal spawn location. 
    • The 🚗💴 correct ✅✅ position 🙏🏿 for 🎅 the 🅱 player 🤷 is 😍🍊 roughly 3 🏼 squares from the 🚟🎅 wall. ⌨ 

⬥ Rush 🏃🏃 to 200K HP and the 🌜👏 portal should 😤 be nearly dead from AoEs. Taraket will 🤷 then 😂🙈 move 🏼 to 🙌 spawn the Bloated Monstrosity. 
    • He can 🔫💦 be kept 🔄 in 🛌👉 the 🏻👏 lure spot 😪 by 👀😈 repositioning to MD east 👉👉 of 💦 him 🤴 and then 🔙 moving south 👇 2 💁 ticks after 💦 the skybox changes. 🚼 
        - This ☝💺 is 👌💯 inconsistent if 👏 the skeletons 💀 from 🌎😂 the portal are 😟 also ☹ MD of him 😱⬆ at the 🚟 time so 💯 the 👏 boss 🏾👨 may 🤷 need to ☃💸 be 🐝🐝 relured.

**Lure example:** <https://youtu.be/7JGT6zV35CY>

⬥ Throw your Vulnerability Bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and charge Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> on the boss. 
    • The 💦😐 Bloated Monstrosity should 😀💘 MD and 🚙 the 👏🅱 two can be 🏳🎮 caught 🐾👮 in 🚪 AoEs until 🍆🕖 the ⏩ boss 👨😍 is DPSed back 💀🙅 down 🚂 to ➡➡ 200k. 
    • Try to 💰💦 keep 👌🙊 the 💶 boss 😎 in the 🌷 lure spot 📽 again and kill 💞 the 💦 monstrosity as 😥 Taraket is 😩😤 flying to 📖😏 spawn the Corpse ⚰ Carrier.

.
⬥ Lure and 🍀 AoE the 👏 two 💘 while ⌛♀ focusing 🤓 on 🏽🔛 the 💰😈 Corpse Carrier. 
    • The 🌊🤓 skeletons 💀 that ➕ spawn at ❤💰 this ⬆💦 point can 💦♂ be 💪🤓 absorbed 😵😵 by 😀😡 the ❄👏 boss 😎😍 to 💦 uber 🚗🚗 heal himself 😎 and also add 👈 up to a 😯😩 lot 🍑🍑 of 💦 damage taken. 🔫😔 

⬥ Damage him 💕🦊 until 😍⏰ phase 🌘😶 point ⬆⚫ and he 🏑 will 🅱😡 use Death's Swiftness and 👑 then 😂 2x Spirit Wall. ⌨⌨ Stay MD and ✊🗣 walk 🚶 to 🔁💦 the opposite 🔃 side of 👀💯 the boss to 💰👉 avoid 🙅 this mechanic. 
    • Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be used at this time.

**Example:** <https://youtu.be/H7MfqLltWyg>

⬥ After 👀 this, 👉⬆ the 👏👏 boss can 💰 be 🐝🐝 easily 😊😊 killed with a standard rotation. 
    • Another rift may 💖📅 be 🐝 spawned at 🍆 some ☝💥 point 🈯📍 but shouldn't be an issue 🙅🙅 if 😂 the lure has 💳 been 💫 maintained and/or the 😊⭐ boss 😍 is 😦 low ⬇⬇ enough 💦💦 HP to 💦 ignore it.

**__Room 5:__**
There ✔ is a 💕👌 Sea 🌊 Witch and ➕👏 two 💏 Armoured Zombies in 😬🍞 this 🏼🌈 room. Very straightforward, just DPS as 🤔🕐 seen 👀 fit. 🏼🏼 Sea 🌊🌊 Witches have extremely 😝🤔 delayed attacks so you 👦🤛 may still take 🤳 a 😱 moderate mage hit several seconds 😫 after it 😒 has died. 😂😂

**__Room 6:__**
⬥ Only 🍗 the Kalgerion Demon 👺👹 needs 🙏 to be 🅱 killed ☠❌ here ⏸ to 😖💱 proceed. He's really 👄😍 big 💪⬆ and 🍆👏 impossible to miss, 😞😞 
    • Activate Demon Slayer <:demonslayer:641339921675845633> and kill the Kal’gerion demon. 
    • Finish off with 👏👬 more 🙅 strong basics and thresholds. 
        - You 👶👉 can manipulate one ☝😬 of 👯💯 the ♂😷 required 📋✅ Necromancers in 👏😩 room 🏗🏚 7 to ✡😂 move ♂ from 🍆 his 🏻 position 😫 to 🍆 make 👏 the next ☃ room easier 😀😀 on 🏽 you by 😈😈 running ♀ as 💰🅰 close 😍😍 as you can 🔫🔫 to 💦 him, so he 👦👂 aggros you 👈👸 through the 🏿 wall. 
        - This isn’t 100% guaranteed, and 🔬👏 if 😳✈ you 💯 don’t 🚫 get 🆙🉐 it 😡😭 simply skip it and 🔝💦 proceed. 🚶

**__Room 7:__**
There's 🔫👉 two ✌ Necromancers (marked in 🅱 red) ♨ hiding 💆 around in 👏😋 this room 😶😈 that need to 💦💯 be 🐝 cleared. Dump some 🐅 thresholds and 🍽🍆 proceed. 🚶🚶

**__Room 8:__**
Another 🚪👄 two Necromancers are guarding the 😫 gate here ⛄🔢 so 💯💯 just 🕛 continue picking 👋 them off. 📴 The 👏 Sea 🌊🌊 Witches and The Magister miniboss that can 🤔 spawn at the east 🌍 side 🚔🙋 of the 😍 room have 😏✅ a 😄 fairly large 🏔🏯 aggro range so 👏😚 preferably hug the 💦 wall 🎸🎸 as 🏿💦 you enter. 💦💦

There is a group of Crassian Warriors and Scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. There's a decent amount of damage to do here so Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> are recommended. They stack up very nicely for all AoEs and aren't very threatening in general.

**__Room 2:__**
⬥ Two ✌💏 Warped Skeletons 💀💀 in here that can 🔫 completely 😍 clear 📝 you 💦👏 if 🤔🤥 you 🤞👊 aren't paying attention. 🗣 
    • If you sunned earlier at ❤🍆 the 💦🔥 previous gate, you can 🤔💦 finish 🏁🔚 the 💰👏 remaining 🕵🕵 duration in 👇 here. 
    • It's recommended to keep ⏩💩 them snared/stunned to 🏼 not have to 💦🎲 deal with 💰😲 this.

.
**__Room 3:__**
⬥ Run behind the line of Zealots and Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> to clear this room fairly quickly. 
    • Be wary of getting cleared by the skeletons but an Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> can freeze all the mobs in here nicely. 

**__Room 4:__** 
The last 🏼 room 😜 before the final boss 😂😎 of 💦 the dungeon. ⛓⛓ There 👌👥 are two 🎄👬 more skeletons 💀 along 🔝 with 👏👏 two Crassian Scouts that 😐👑 need 🙏 to be 🐝 cleared to 👏 proceed. 🚶🚶 They're 👨 pretty 💅 spread 🍕🍕 out 🏿😱 so 💝 just ☝👏 dps and 👏🙏 make 📝 sure 😉🌚 to be ❄ on 🔛👇 high adrenaline for 🎅🕓 the ⚕🏳 encounter with 😣👻 The Ambassador. 

There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly Bladed Dive <:bd:535532854281764884> + Surge <:surge:535533810004262912> close to the western wall.

    • This 🚾 is similar 👱 to 🚻💦 the ⤵ Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but 🍑🍑 will create two areas instead, 👽 separated by 2 😂 ticks. 
        - These 📀 zones will 👏👏 last ⬅ until 🅱🕑 the ⭐👩 final phase of 🐶 the 👌😩 fight 💥 and 👏 deal rapid 2000 😮 damage ☄☄ to anyone 👦 standing 🔪 inside.

⬥ **Black Hole:**
    • The Ambassador will ✊💰 spawn a black 🏴🏴 hole 😾 around 🔃🔹 the 👤 arena that 🚟💀 will explode 💥 after a 🌼 duration, dealing 🏾 8000+ damage ☠☠ to 💦💦 the ⬆ player
    • Despawned by stunning it. 💩

⬥ **Sinister 😰💦 Fragments:**
    • Six fragments will 🖕💰 disperse from 👯 the boss 👨 to the 👏 edges of 🗜 the 😹 arena with 💯👏 20K HP each. 👏 At 👸♂ the 👀 same time, 🕐 the Ambassador will 😘💦 fire 🔥🔥 three slowly 💦 rotating beams that 👏🏻 last 🙅❌ for about 💦 a minute. The beams always 👉 spawn in set 👌🥝 locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.
    • He'll use the Fragments one 😤☝ minute ⌚⏰ into ➡👉 the fight 💥 **OR** 💁💯 hitting 😦 the 🅱💰 650K cap. The 🌊 next phase is 🕛 at 550K.

.
**__550K-400K HP__**
⬥ Upon 💰 hitting 550K HP, the 💰 Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that ✌🚪 deal low 👏🔽 ranged damage and ☠👏 make 🖕📝 it harder to resonance his mage autos. 

.
**__400K-0 HP__**
⬥ Seiryu will spawn shortly after 🕑 400K, clearing all 💯👶 Crassians and infested areas.

⬥ A ring 📱💍 of 💦💦 black hands will 🏼😩 spawn to 😩 encompass the 🍗😜 edge of the 🏠 arena. The 🍂 Ambassador will 😩🎧 stop ✋ doing 🅰 his corruption and 👉 black 🏿 hole 🤗🍑 mechanics and continue 💰 his auto 🤖🤖 attack pattern as 💰😱 normal. 🖖🖖 

⬥ The 🐗🌊 hands 😲✋ will 🏾 slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant 💰💰 smoke 🌫 projectiles towards the 👏 ambassador. These will 🙏 heal the boss 👨💼 2500 HP for each 👋👏 smoke 🌫 let in 👉 and 💕 can 😧💰 be blocked, directing a small amount 📉🔢 of 💰💰 damage ☄☄ towards ⛪⛪ the player.  

.
⬥ **Magic 📿 Onslaught** 
    •  Every 😤👏 10 auto 🤖🤖 attacks, the 👏 Ambassador will 👏👊 send ➡ out 5 🐥 extremely hard hitting 😦😦 Magic ✨ attacks.

.
__**Strategy**__ <:Magic:689504724159823906>
**1M HP**
⬥ Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> right away, with a good rotation and prayer flicking the Ambassador's auto attacks. Placing corruption around the boss anywhere that isn't inconvenient. 
    • This 👌 part is 😍 easily 😃 doable without 🤚💯 using defensives or 💁🍆 eating as 🅱🤔 long 🍆 as 😱🕐 you 🏼👉 don't 🚫 mess ☠ up prayers. 🙏🙏

**Spinners**
⬥ During fragments, run around between beams spamming Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> and Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> with strong abilities. 
    • Try to use Natural Instinct <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> around 10s before the Spin ends. 
        - This allows you to use Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> without an Adrenaline Potion.

.
⬥ Another full Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation and the second set of fragments should be skipped if the player's DPS is good. 
    • Otherwise, just keep going until the boss reaches 550k. If health begins to run low, the mage hits can be Resonanced <:res:535541258844635148>. 
        - Using Devotion <:devo:513190158728953857> early on during Ritual Keepers allows you to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> the mage hits risk free and it will come back up in time for Magic Onslaught later on. 
        - Try 🏃😐 to 💦💦 not panic 😰😰 eat 🗣 when 👏 the boss is nearing 400k HP as 😎🏿 Seiryu will 👏👏 heal you to 💦 full. 🈵

**Ritual**
⬥ During 🏃 the final 🔮😪 phase, 🌓 stand 👫🕴 melee distance of 💦 the boss 💼 and 👏🐦 start 👣 blocking ⛔ the 🅱⚰ smokes appropriately, moving slowly 💦💦 clockwise. 
    • Be 🙋🅱 wary of 😜 your adrenaline 💉 to 💦 protect 🛡⚔ yourself 😝👫 from 🍆👉 his Magic ✨ Onslaught. 
    • The optimal Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> location is straight on top of the boss as this allows the player to always be in their ultimate as they circle the Ambassador. 

⬥ Continue DPSing and do some combination of Resonance,<:res:535541258844635148> Reflect, <:reflect:535541258786177064> and Vitality Potion <:vitality:654618235097972737> on the second mage onslaught. 
    • If you're going to Resonance <:res:535541258844635148>, it's recommended to step out of the smoke to prevent it from being sniped by the it.
