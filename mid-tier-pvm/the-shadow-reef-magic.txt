**Room 1:** Kill the mobs with what you have available.

**Room 2:** If using Magic run behind the 3 Scouts and <:deto:535533833358016512>. The scuttlers will MD you by the time it's charged. 

**Room 3:** If you're on ancients, you can <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> the line of Warriors and all the mobs in this room will be lined up for <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and <:dbreath:535533833391702017>.

.
`Easy video guide:` <https://youtu.be/bETOKmCEv6I>

**Room 4:** There's only two Cloaked Zealots to clear here and they're lined up for AoEs so just do whatever you want here, <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, <:chain:535533833056026624>, <:deto:535533833358016512> if you want to.
 
**Room 5:** There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. Aggro the zealots and move back a few steps to stack the mobs together for AoEs. <:deto:535533833358016512> may be used but is likely better for the next room. 

.
`Example:` <https://youtu.be/VYA1tj-7dqg>

**Room 6:** This room has two groups of zombies. The first set will stack into your <:deto:535533833358016512> if you charge it near the entrance rather than surging past them. You don't want to draw aggro from the second group early as that splits them up and makes them harder to AoE. Most if not all of the second group is quickly lurable into a <:tsunami:535533809995874304>. 

**Room 7:** Fairly small room, use <:deto:535533833358016512> once all the npcs are md for MD. 

`Another easy video guide:` <https://youtu.be/h4Y3gEqJ6rg>

**Room 8:** You only need to kill the two zealots here to use AoE's and conserve your adrenaline.

> __**The Crassian Leviathan**__
.tag:crassian
.img:https://i.imgur.com/uLxEnlg.png
.
  As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast.

__**Mechanics**__

**Poison pits + Additional heads:** The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant.

**Dragon Breath:** This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic.

.
**Head Sweep:** The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins, as seen here (applicable for melee with scythe): <https://youtu.be/kOnRdfXKitI>

After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena. Avoid entering the center here by bladed dive and surging across. Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. It will then go through the same rotation, starting at Dragon Breath again, so position appropriately. Optimally, this fight can be completed in 90 seconds or less, shortly after the the boss swaps sides.

.
__**Strategy**__
<:Magic:689504724159823906> Under a <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, aim to fit 2 <:asphyx:535533833072672778> <:wm:535533809978966037> <:deep:535533833139912724> and 1 <:deto:535533833358016512> . Dump Guthix Staff as seen fit.

.
**Room 9:** There is a cloaked zealot and various scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. You can generally stand behind the zealot and the scuttlers will MD you for AoEs. 

**Room 10:** Put your salve amulet back on. Very spread out zombies in here that are fairly annoying to AoE as mage. Most of the time you can catch most of them in a <:deto:535533833358016512> fairly quickly and then finish off the stragglers with your remaining abilities.

.
**Room 11:** Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. There's not much to this room but focusing the necromancer will clear the skeletons in the AoE available. Save <:deto:535533833358016512>  for the next Room: 

**Room 12:** There are two necromancers off at the sides and a line of three Armoured Zombies that stack up very well for a <:deto:535533833358016512> guarding the door. You only need to kill one necromancer and the zombies to proceed to section 2, the temple area. 

.
> __**Second floor entry - Taraket entry**__
.tag:SFTE
.img:https://i.imgur.com/UFagGwx.png
.
**Room 1:** There are two Ulthven Necromancers guarding the gates to the east and west that you must clear to access the black stone artefacts. The main gate will not drop until these have been activated. A mass of summoned skeletons will form in the room as you go about this task, making it a very easy soul split opportunity with <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> before you proceed. 

**Room 2:** This is the archer bridge where you get pelted with small ranged hits constantly. There are two Sea Horrors and a necromancer at the end of this room that you must clear to proceed. The horrors deal a ton of damage so, as mage, it's important to avoid them by standing atleast at a 7sq range. You'll want to use <:devo:513190158728953857> and <:revenge:535541259645878302> hits 10 stacks immediately here. Focus on dealing damage here and you'll be out very quickly. 

Use AoE's under <:revenge:535541259645878302> for the best damage possible
.
A lot of learners panic eat a ton here but the bridge can be done with no food
`Example:` <https://youtu.be/I_4wbqXoZaw>

**Room 3:** There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. They are melee and line up well for AoEs.

**Room 4:** <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912> through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes and go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. 

.
> __**Taraket the Necromancer**__
.tag:taraket
.img:https://i.imgur.com/RwJxxnH.png
.
This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. He and his Corpses are affected by Salve Amulet and <:undeadslayer:641339922019516416> <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> for increased damage output.
.
> __**Mechanics**__

⬥ **Rift of Undeath** 
    • A Rift of Undeath with 30K HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing heavy damage to the player. Should be killed before it detonates.

⬥ **Death's Swiftness:** 
    • Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from Mage to Ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage than usual, so be prepared to use <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812> aswell as <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462>.

.
⬥ **Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity:** Upon reaching 200K hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning one of the two corpses: Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90K HP each. 

    • The __Corpse Carrier__ will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive
    • The __Bloated Monstrosity__ increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. 

Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200K HP afterwards. 

The first spawn will always be the closest crystal to Taraket

⬥  **Spirit Line:** 
    • Taraket summons a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid typeless damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. 

Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned.

.
__**Strategy**__

Ancients are highly recommended to AoE the various targets down while staying on the boss. <:undeadslayerperk:689502804720615441> and Salve Amulet (e) are extremely helpful as well.

Start the fight with <:comb:535533833098100745> and <:escape:535541258832052231> to lure Taraket on top of his portal spawn location. The correct position for the player is roughly 3 squares from the wall. Rush to 200K HP and the portal should be nearly dead from AoEs. Taraket will then move to spawn the Bloated Monstrosity. He can be kept in the lure spot by repositioning to MD east of him and then moving south 2 ticks after the skybox changes. This is inconsistent if the skeletons from the portal are also MD of him at the time so the boss may need to be relured.

`Lure example:` <https://youtu.be/7JGT6zV35CY>

<:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> and charge <:deto:535533833358016512> on the boss. The Bloated Monstrosity should MD and the two can be caught in AoEs until the boss is DPSed back down to 200k. Try to keep the boss in the lure spot again and kill the monstrosity as Taraket is flying to spawn the Corpse Carrier.

.
Lure and AoE the two while focusing on the Corpse Carrier. The skeletons that spawn at this point can be absorbed by the boss to uber heal himself and also add up to a lot of damage taken. Damage him until phase point and he will use Death's Swiftness and then 2x Spirit Wall. Stay MD and walk to the opposite side of the boss to avoid this mechanic. <:flank4:712073088296157185> can be used at this time.

`Example:` <https://youtu.be/H7MfqLltWyg>

After this, the boss can be easily killed with a standard rotation. Another rift may be spawned at some point but shouldn't be an issue if the lure has been maintained and/or the boss is low enough HP to ignore it.

.
**Room 5:** There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Very straightforward, just DPS as seen fit. Sea Witches have extremely delayed attacks for some reason so you may still take a moderate mage hit several seconds after it has died. Don't use Assault because you’ll want to save it for the next room.

**Room 6:** Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer and kill the Kal’gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. 

You can manipulate one of the required necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. But this isn’t 100% guaranteed, and if you don’t get it simply skip it and proceed.

.
**Room 7:** There's two necromancers (marked in red) hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Dump some thresholds and proceed.

**Room 8:** Another two necromancers are guarding the gate here so just continue picking them off. The Sea Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east side of the room have a fairly large aggro range so preferably hug the wall as you enter. 

.
> __**Third floor entry - pre-Ambassador**__
.tag:TFPA
.img:https://i.imgur.com/mt2dC5P.png
.
**Room 1:** There is a group of Crassian Warriors and scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. There's a decent amount of damage to do here so <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and <:deto:535533833358016512> are recommended. They stack up very nicely for all AoEs and aren't very threatening in general.

**Room 2:** Two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. If you sunned earlier at the previous gate, you can finish the remaining duration in here. The skeletons can deal a moderate mage hit frequently, healing themselves while dealing 2000-3000 damage to you. It's recommended to keep them snared/stunned to not have to deal with this.

.
**Room 3:** There are two more Warped Skeletons along with three Cloaked Zealots guarding the gate. Run behind the line of Zealots and <:deto:535533833358016512> to clear this room fairly quickly. Once again, be wary of getting cleared by the skeletons but an <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> can freeze all the mobs in here nicely. 

**Room 4:** The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. They're pretty spread out so just dps and make sure to be on high adrenaline for the encounter with The Ambassador. 

There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly <:bd:535532854281764884> + <:surge:535533810004262912>. 

.
> __**Kranon, the Ambassador**__
.tag:Ambassador
.img:https://i.imgur.com/0CrSo5E.png
.
At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. 

The boss primarily attacks with ranged <:DeflectRange:544195488317046812>, with a heavy mage attack <:DeflectMage:544195487926845462> after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe <:DeflectMelee:544195488447201300> if the player is in melee distance.

.
__**Mechanics**__

> **__1M-550K HP__**
⬥ **Purple Corruption:** 
    • The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. 

    • This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside.

⬥ **Black Hole:** 
    • The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player, this can be despawned by stunning it.

⬥ **Sinister Fragments:** 
    • Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20K HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last for about a minute. The beams always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly.

    • He'll use the Fragments one minute into the fight **OR** hitting the 650K cap. The next phase is at 550K.

.
> **__550K-400K HP__**	
    • Upon hitting 550K HP, the Ambassador spawns invulnerable Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. 

.
> **__400K-0 HP__**
    • Seiryu will spawn shortly after 400K, clearing all Crassians and infested areas.

    • A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. 

    • The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player.  

.
⬥ **Magic Onslaught** 
    •  Every 10 auto attacks, the Ambassador will send out 5 extremely hard hitting Magic attacks.

> __**Ambassador's attack rotation**__
⬥ *1M HP to 550K - Phase 1*
    • Mage/Melee auto → 5 autos → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Black Hole → 5 autos  → Purple Corruption → 5 autos  → Sinister Fragments → Repeat 

⬥ *550K to 400K - Phase 2*
    • Uses the same auto attack rotation until Ritual.

⬥ *Ritual - Kill*
    • 5 autos → Melee/Magic → 5 autos → Melee/Magic → Onslaught


__**Strategy**__ <:Magic:689504724159823906>

<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> right away, with a good rotation and prayer flicking the Ambassador's auto attacks. Placing corruption around the boss anywhere that isn't inconvenient. This part is easily doable without using defensives or eating as long as you don't mess up prayers.

During fragments, run around between beams spamming <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> <:wrack:535533809823645697> and strong abilities. Try to use <:NaturalInstinct:513213538496675850> around 10s before the Spin ends, this allows you to use Sunshine without an Adrenaline Potion.

.
Do another full <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> rotation and the second set of fragments should be skipped if the player's DPS is good. Otherwise, just keep going until the boss reaches 550k. If health begins to run low, the mage hits can be <:res:535541258844635148>. Using <:devo:513190158728953857> early on during Ritual Keepers allows you to <:res:535541258844635148> the mage hits risk free and it will come back up in time for Magic Onslaught later on. Try to not panic eat when the boss is nearing 400k HP as Seiryu will heal you to full.

During the final phase, stand melee distance of the boss and start blocking the smokes appropriately, moving slowly clockwise. Be wary of your adrenaline to protect yourself from his Magic Onslaught. The optimal <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> location is straight on top of the boss as this allows the player to always be in their ultimate as they circle the Ambassador. 

Continue DPSing and do some combination of <:res:535541258844635148> <:reflect:535541258786177064> <:vitality:654618235097972737> etc. on the second mage onslaught. If you're going to <:res:535541258844635148>, it's recommended to step out of the smoke to prevent it from being sniped. DPS to 0 and the fight is over.
