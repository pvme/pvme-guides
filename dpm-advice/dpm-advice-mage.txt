.tag:intro
In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

> **__Revolution__**
.tag:Revo
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline.

.
⬥ While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance.

.
⬥ Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++, using this bar with 0 player input will yield ~130k DPM:

.
⬥ To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Dn6UDOV.png

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
⬥ Basic Revolution (commonly referred to as simply "Revolution") is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated.

.
⬥ Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities.

.
⬥ Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ihbsrD9.png
.
    • Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar − you will be manually activating them. 

.
⬥ If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you.
    • Activate sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> once you reach 100% adrenaline.
        - From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724>). Repeat.

.
⬥ Following this simple repeating pattern of *Build to 100% → Sunshine → Thresholds → Repeat*, one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player.
    • No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player.

.
⬥ The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario.

.
⬥ Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate.
    • Refer to the revolution bars as examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice.

.
⬥ Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates.
    • The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe.
        - Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution.

.
⬥ An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy.
    • Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough.

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta).

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation__**
.tag:Priority
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns.
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again – during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities.

.
⬥ To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns.

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum):
.img:https://i.imgur.com/BFrPlAE.png
.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind.

.
⬥ Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, flank Impact <:flank4:712073088296157185> <:impact:535533809655873556>, and walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>.

.
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast <:sonic:535533809924571136>/<:conc:535533833106489365> would be considered a weak ability (Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, non-flank Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, single-target Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>).
    • Generally speaking, these should be avoided.

.
⬥ If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as often as possible in your rotation.
    • A basic pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

.
⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as filler abilities.
    • This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> → Ability → Repeat will give you strong dps.

> **__Cancelling Channels__**
.tag:Cancel
**__Why to Cancel__**
⬥ Magic has 4 channeled abilities, but this section will only apply to 3 as they are more traditional channels
    • These 3 are: Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, and Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ It is important to properly cancel abilities in order to not lose any ticks, as the animation can take longer than the actual channel takes to fully apply
    • Watch the following example of a Cancelled vs an Uncancelled channel (Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> in this scenario)
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/6uH4KVg.mp4
.
**__When to Cancel Channels__**
⬥ In almost all scenarios, you will cancel Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

.
⬥ Typically you will cancel your Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • To cancel on 3rd hit you would cancel on t5 (3s)
    • To cancel on 2nd hit you would cancel on t3 (1.8s)
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ For more information on cancelling, refer to <@145413546409197569>'s Video on cancelling

> **__Detonate__**
.tag:Deto
**__What Makes Detonate Unique__**
⬥ As mentioned, Magic has 4 channels, 3 of which were mentioned prior, this section will be dedicated to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> due to how differently it works compared to other channels

.
⬥ Unlike most channels Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> acts like or can have the following done within it:
    • It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> with an Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> given the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is not on cooldown)
    • You can throw Vulnerability Bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> during its charge time
    • You can SBS <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154> during its charge time
    • You can Shield Dome during its charge time
    • You can stall its release
        - Generally speaking you cannot stall channels (outside of melees wherein only 1 hit is stalled)

.
⬥ Typically, when releasing Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> you will release it with an Auto and an Ability
    • An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave → Detonate (3t/1.8s) → Auto Deto Dragon Breath (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t/1.8s) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>)
        - The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> then Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> then Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>

> **__Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__**
.tag:DwVs2H
This section is meant to list the benefits of camping one over the other though it is strongly recommended to just juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits, and more.

.
**__Staff Camp benefits__** <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
    • When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities
⬥ More Revolution-friendly
    • Due to using Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> over Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> is not a channeled ability.

.
**__Dual Wield Camp benefits__** <:pwand:583429876242186260> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ Easier swapping
    • You can swap to Shield <:malevkite:513190159412625411> or Flanks <:flank4:712073088296157185> more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap

*Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as "Defensive Autos", it is more technical to say it is non-damaging abilities, and so includes Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>.*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Typically, when you cast an ability it put your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with
    • i.e., if you cast an average speed (staff ability) it will be 6t (3.6s), if you cast a fastest speed (wand ability) it will be 4t (2.4s)

.
⬥ Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you cast one it will not put your auto on cooldown
    • This has several implications, the first applies to all styles, the second is magic specific

.
**__Implications__**
⬥ Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> or Entagle <:ent:567727987274022924>) *then* the defensive
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
.
```
T0: Wand Ability
T3: Defensive
T4: Auto is cast
T6: Ability
```
.img:https://i.imgur.com/YG0dSvD.mp4
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, as the cooldown for any Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all)
    • A further consideration, is if that ability on t6 is a non-channeled dw ability, you can 4tick an ability afterwards
        - This can be seen in the following video by <@593106625955495947>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw

.
⬥ Secondly, a benefit magic has, due to it having auto binds, is that you can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick (rather than an auto is cast on 1 tick, and the ability a tick after)
    • This allows magic to do a 2H abil into a defensive auto as a result
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
```
T0: Staff Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto + Ability
```
.img:https://i.imgur.com/HI2ebR6.mp4
.
    • For Melee and Ranged this would result in:
```
T0: Average Speed 2H Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto
T7: Ability
```
    • This is important as it is highly beneficial to make use of this when staff camping, as it will aid in preventing you using bad abilities like Tuska's Wrath and Sacrifice due to the lack of abilities at your disposal

.
⬥ It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto
    • You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it

.   
⬥ It is also important to note that if you click anything from your inventory, or click the ground anywhere, before the auto would naturally fire then you must re-click your target
    • With Magic, hitting your auto bind yields the same result

.
**__Delaying Defensive Auto__**
⬥ Based off this fact, you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason
    • More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what *both* the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it
    • The following examples will be done with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>, however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast
    • For Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> specifically, we will "off" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto

.
⬥ There are several ways to "off" to delay the auto, these include:
    • Clicking under yourself
    • Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook)
    • Clicking something from your inventory

.
*Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto.*

.
⬥ There are also a couple differences between hitting your auto bind to cast your auto and clicking to cast your auto after you "off", they are as follows:
    • You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you need to 3 tick it
    • If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it
    • You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD
    • If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1 tick after otherwise you will override it
        - if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks

.
.
⬥ Thus, for Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> we can do as follows:
    • Instead of the normal
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: 2H Auto cast
T6: Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/d4iq92F.mp4
.
    • We can instead do:
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: "Off"
T6: 2H Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/SGCIwm6.mp4
.
*Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration*

.
⬥ What are the differences between these two scenarios?
    • The 2H Auto is cast and thus hits at different times
    • We can alter the 2H Auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocasted spell is
        - We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto → Freedom (e.g., <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>)

.
*Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you "off" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.*

> **__4TAA__**
.tag:4TAA
**__What it is__**
⬥ 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA), is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before

.
⬥ As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown
    • 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (staff) ability

.
⬥ So to 4TAA, we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and thus auto) binds
    • We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick

.
**__How it Works__**
⬥ The general 4TAA structure will be like:
```
Auto + 2H/Dw Ability → non-channeled Dw Ability → Repeat
```

⬥ As you can see, the auto is forced every other ability, this is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability

.
⬥ Further, you can see the ability before it repeats (i.e., before you do your next auto + ability) has to be a non-channeled Dw ability
    • It *must* be a dw ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later
    • It *must* be non-channeled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown
        - Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channeled ability

.
⬥ Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either a 2H or Dw ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perking and tiers
    • That being said, you *must* (outside of very niche cases) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channeled, that the channeled ability is done with Dw (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate, as Concentrated Blast is already Dw locked, and Smoke Tendrils is not relevant)
        - This is because of the fact that when the channeled hits reset your auto cd, it is going to reset it based off the weapon you are wearing, thus if you staff asphyx, when your asphyx ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown again
        - The table below will showcase two different scenarios:
```
2H Asphyxiate:

You MUST do:
auto + asphyxiate → ability → dw abil → auto + ability

Dw Asphyxiate:

You can do:
auto + asphyxiate → dw ability → auto + ability
```

**__Video Guide by <@162317885044293632>__**
https://youtu.be/HmZR1BBwsK0

.
**__Text Based Guide__**
⬥ The basic principles is you can do lossless spellcasting by hitting a spell from actionbar (lossless meaning you don't lose ticks performing the action)
    • This lets you auto the same tick as you use an ability (input is auto → abil)

.
⬥ When you can autoattack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: <:praeswand:643166769518739477> = 4t and <:noxstaff:513190159294922753> = 6t

.
⬥  Your delay after an action is given by max(currentdelay, delay from action)
    • Implications from this are that if you do a wand ability you'll be able to autoattack 4 ticks after. If you do a staff ability, you will be able to autoattack 7 ticks after.

.
**__A simple step-by-step practice rotation on how to 4 tick auto attack:__**
⬥ Things you need:
    • Wand + Orb <:pwand:583429876242186260> <:impercore:643166751067996160>

**__4TAA Additional Info__**
⬥ **Note that this is just a practice rotation**. Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> is generally not a good basic ability to use in combat and is only utilized here due to it's very short cooldown. In real combat, replace Wrack with Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, etc.
⬥ When practising, set the combat dummy to 'Max Hit Mode' then take note of how much damage your Staff auto attack deals compared to a Wand auto attack. To benefit from 4TAA, you want to consistently do Staff auto attacks.
⬥ Step 4 must be done in quick succession; all inputs must be done within one tick. To make this easier on yourself try keybinding your Wand/Orb/Auto in an easy to reach set of keystrokes.
⬥ This guide only covers the basic pattern of 4TAA. Once you're confident in performing steps 1-6, try to mix and match other basic abilities to create your own 4TAA rotation.
⬥ You will know you did not lose any ticks between auto and abilities if you do not see the auto firing animation, but the auto itself still firing
