⬥ In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch: high damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again. During this time you are forced to use weak abilities

.
⬥ To avoid this problem, the trick is to use filler abilities (ones with decent damage **and** short cooldowns) in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage per tick (in a vacuum):
.

.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritizations **and** cooldowns should be on your mind

.
⬥ You generally will want to prioritize building up to 100% adrenaline and activating Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> as soon as possible
    • Ideally, enter the encounter with 100% adrenaline so you may activate it immediately upon entry

.
⬥ Both within and outside of Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, you will want to prioritize your strong thresholds, special attacks, and modified ultimates. These include Igneous Omnipower <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> <:omni:535533809664262179>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, flanking Deep Impact <:deepimpactflank:867678153611018261>, and Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>

.
⬥ Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> should form the foundation of your rotation. It is a very powerful basic ability with a short cooldown and provides a critical strike chance buff on a subsequent ability
    • Use often as a filler ability, in-between other strong basics (Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>, Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, flanking Impact <:impactflank:867678154369400862>, and walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>) and the aforementioned thresholds, modified ultimates, and special attacks
    • A basic pattern of <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Ability → Ability → repeat is recommended
    • If not yet unlocked, or if camping 2H, <:gconc:869285393223254107> can be substituted with Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> (2-hit) or Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136>, respectively
    • The critical chance buff gained through <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365> is wasted if the follow-up ability is a bleed (<:corruptblast:513190159194259467> / <:comb:535533833098100745>)

.
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> is considered a weak ability (Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, non-flank Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>, unwalked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>)
    • These should be largely avoided

.
⬥ Juggling both DW and 2H weapons gives you access to both (Greater) Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365>, and Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> as filler abilities
    • This may provide you with more breathing room while improvising rotations
    • Care should be taken while weapon juggling so as not to delay usage of <:gconc:869285393223254107> if unlocked. In this case, <:sonic:535533809924571136> should only be used as a fallback to take the place of a weaker ability
    • If <:gconc:869285393223254107> is not yet unlocked, a general pattern of <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → <:conc:535533833106489365> → Ability → repeat is recommended

.
⬥ Generally, if using Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, it is recommended to use Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> if the alternative is weaker than Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • This means Blood Tithe stacks can be retained to boost strong basics such as <:gconc:869285393223254107> or <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, while saving <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> for a future time where a weak ability would have to be used otherwise

.
**__Hit Timings__**
Refer to this table for hit timings of each ability
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/bB6QddH.png
.
*Notes:*
⬥ *All distances mentioned assume Melee Distance (MD) is tile 1, so "8" = (MD + 7) tiles*
⬥ *r2H means "release stalled ability with 2H", rDW means "release stalled ability with dual wield"*

.
> **__What Spells to Use__**
.tag:whatspell
*Note: these are just general guidelines*

.
**__What Autocast to Use__**
⬥ Generally, prefer Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
    • If you plan to utilize Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>, use Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> to get 5 stacks, then swap to <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>

⬥ If the City of Senntisten quest is not yet completed, use Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>
    • The quest should be completed as soon as possible

⬥ If on the standard/normal spellbook, use Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
    • Use the highest rank of air spell available if <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is not yet unlocked

.
**__What Auto to Use__**
*Note 1: This refers to the auto on your bar you would be using for 4-tick Auto Attacking (4TAA) or casting Defensive Autos*
*Note 2: the use of weaker spell variants assumes manual spellcasting is used, use !manualspellcasting in <#534563158304620564> for more details*

⬥ Generally Blood spells
    • Barrage/Burst <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> / <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> if AoE or faster hit timings matter
    • Blitz/Rush <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> / <:bloodrush:839903691329896479> otherwise
        - Can use Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> instead if healing does not matter

⬥ Ice spells when you need or will benefit from the freeze:
    • Use Barrage/Burst <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> / <:iceburst:841419289797197824> or Blitz/Rush <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> / <:icerush:839903691234607136> following same logic for Blood spells
        - Note that <:iceburst:841419289797197824> and <:icerush:839903691234607136> have shorter freeze durations than their counterparts

⬥ If on the standard/normal spellbook, use Air Surge/Strike <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> / <:airstrike:895600427930910730>

.
**__Debuff Spells to Use__**
⬥ You should always have Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> applied, and generally you should always have Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> applied, unless the boss is immune to such conditions
    • Generally, it is always preferred to use Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> instead of the spell
        - Bombs are lossless to apply, whereas the spell is not
        - Cost of bombs is negligible for most mid-tier or higher content
    • Immune creatures:
        - Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082>
        - Araxxor / Araxxi <:Araxxi:513213019543699466>
        - Rise of the Six <:karil:641696573272621086>
        - Sinister Fragments at Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>

⬥ Use Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> if you need the long bind and the fact that is does no damage is irrelevant

.
> **__Cancelling Channels__**
.tag:Cancel
**__Why to Cancel__**
⬥ Magic has four channelled abilities, and one channelled special attack
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>
    • Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>
    • Armadyl Battlestaff <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512>

.
⬥ It is important to properly cancel abilities in order to not lose any ticks, or damage potential
    • Animations can be unreliable, and longer than the actual duration of the ability
    • It can be higher damage-per-tick to cancel long channels early
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> suffers a 1t delay when revolution is enabled
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/9C2JEZQ.mp4
.
**__When to Cancel Channels__**
⬥ Almost without exception, cancel Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> on its 2nd hit as Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

.
⬥ If revolution is enabled, Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> should be "cancelled" as Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)
    • This is not really a cancel, as the ability itself is a 3t channel. It simply avoids the 1t delay caused by revolution

.
⬥ Typically you will cancel your Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the either the 2nd hit as Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s), or the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • 2-hit can net higher damage-per-tick, or higher adren gain, when compared to 4-hit
        - <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> is still a strong option, especially if not 4taa
    • To cancel on the 3rd hit you would cancel on t5 (3s)
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ The Armadyl Battlestaff <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> special attack is generally used for its full duration of 5t (3s)

.

> **__Detonate__**
.tag:Deto
**__What Makes Detonate Unique__**
⬥ Detonate is not technically a channel; however, it is often considered one as a result of its unique charge-and-release mechanism. This section describes Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> and dives into how it is different than previously described channels

.
⬥ Unlike other channels, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>:
    • Acts similar to a defensive in the context of defensive autos. Auto cooldown is not incurred until its release, meaning you can release it with an auto
        - Example: charge <:deto:535533833358016512> → auto + release <:deto:535533833358016512>
    • You can do the following while charging, without interrupting the ability:
        - Throw Vulnerability Bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858>
        - Spellbook swap <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154>
        - Shield Dome <:sd:537341954392850442>
    • You can stall its release
        - Generally speaking you cannot stall channels (outside of melees wherein only 1 hit is stalled)
    • It is not affected by the Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>

.
⬥ Typically, when releasing Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> you will release it with both the aforementioned auto, as well as an ability
    • Example: <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t/1.8s) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037>
        - The hit timing and input order here is crucial: <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:deto:535533833358016512> + <:wm:535533809978966037> must be executed in exactly that order, on the same tick
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Dcdk6IR.mp4
.
⬥ There is an odd occurrence wherein Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15%
    • This can be explained as follows: the game thinks you both have a target and not at the same time, so it uses adrenaline from both your target and the adrenaline inherently used from using it without a target
        - To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>

.
⬥ Further, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> works like normal AoEs wherein it is centered at the true center of the target (for any >=2x2 target this will be the SW tile)
    • If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> without a target, it will be centered on your player
    • If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> with a target, and the target dies before you release, then:
        - If you target cycle onto another target, the explosion will remain centered on the original (dead) target position
        - If you do not target cycle, the explosion will center onto the player

.
⬥ There exists a bug where casting Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> on the tick your target dies will cancel the charge completely

.
⬥ The AoE size of Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> is dependent on the charge amount on release, as represented in the following diagram:

> **__Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__**
.tag:DWVs2H
*Note: this section is meant to list the benefits of camping one over the other though it is strongly recommended to just juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits, and more*

.
**__Dual Wield Camp Benefits__** <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ Access to Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • This is an immensely powerful basic and can be used every 3 abilities
        - <:gconc:869285393223254107> also boasts much better synergy with the City of Senntisten spells <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> <:incitefear:856635090783567902> compared to Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136>
    • Its strength means that camping dual wields, even if they are several weapon tiers lower, can be significantly stronger than camping 2H
⬥ Easier swapping
    • You can swap to a shield <:malevkite:513190159412625411>, flanking switch <:flank4:712073088296157185>, or caroming switch <:caroming4:791281588792590336> more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap

.
**__Staff Camp Benefits__** <:soa:869284271595069451>
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
    • When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities
⬥ Can be more revolution-friendly on low HP mobs, such as for Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857>

.
> **__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:DefAutos
*Note 1: While this section is colloquially referred to as "Defensive Autos", it is more technically correct to refer to them as "non-damaging". Additional examples of such abilities include Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>, and targeted Magma Tempest <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284>*
*Note 2: Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is again used to signify autos for demonstration purposes only*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Generally, casting any ability will put your auto-attack <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on the weapon speed of your weapon
    • Staff ability (average speed) will place it on a 6t (3.6s) cooldown
    • Wand/Orb ability (fastest speed) will place it on a 4t (2.4s) cooldown

.
⬥ Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this: when cast, they will **not** incur auto cooldown
    • This has several implications, the first applies to all styles, the second is magic specific

.
**__Implications__**
⬥ Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> will happen mid-Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> or Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924>) *then* the defensive
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
.
```
T0: Wand Ability
T3: Non-Damaging/Defensive Ability
T4: Auto is cast
T6: Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/YG0dSvD.mp4
.
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, as the cooldown for any Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the DW ability cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all)
    • A further consideration, is if that ability on t6 is a non-channelled DW ability, you can 4tick an ability afterwards
        - This can be seen in the following video by <@593106625955495947>
.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw
.
⬥ Secondly, a benefit magic has, due to it having auto binds, is that you can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick (rather than an auto is cast on 1 tick, and the ability a tick after)
    • This allows magic to do a 2H ability into a defensive auto as a result
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
```
T0: Staff Ability
T3: Non-Damaging/Defensive Ability
T6: Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/HI2ebR6.mp4
.
    • For Melee and Ranged this would result in:
```
T0: Average Speed 2H Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto
T7: Ability
```

.
⬥ It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2H auto
    • You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it

.
⬥ It is also important to note that if you click anything from your inventory, or click the ground anywhere, before the auto would naturally fire then you must re-click your target
    • With Magic, hitting your auto bind yields the same result

.
**__Delaying Defensive Auto__**
⬥ Based off this fact, you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason
    • More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what *both* the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it
    • The following examples will be done with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>, however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast
    • For Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> specifically, we will "off" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto

.
⬥ There are several ways to "off" to delay the auto, these include:
    • Clicking under yourself
    • Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook)
    • Clicking something from your inventory

.
*Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto.*

.
⬥ There are also a couple differences between hitting your auto bind to cast your auto and clicking to cast your auto after you "off", they are as follows:
    • You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you need to 3 tick it
    • If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it
    • You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD
    • If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1 tick after otherwise you will override it
        - if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks

.
.
⬥ Thus, for Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> we can do as follows:
    • Instead of the normal
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: 2H Auto cast
T6: Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/d4iq92F.mp4
.
    • We can instead do:
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: "Off"
T6: 2H Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/SGCIwm6.mp4
.
*Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration*

.
⬥ What are the differences between these two scenarios?
    • The 2H Auto is cast and thus hits at different times
    • We can alter the 2H Auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocasted spell is
        - We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto → Freedom (e.g., <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>)

.
*Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you "off" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.*

.
**__Common Applications of Defensive Autos__**
⬥ Applying Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> with Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> is a non-damaging ability, meaning an auto can be cast along with the following ability
    • This benefit makes for a convenient time to apply Smoke Cloud, for example, at the start of the encounter: <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> → <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:gconc:869285393223254107>

⬥ Magma Tempest (Targeted) <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284>
    • The targeted version of this ability can act as a non-damaging ability, meaning the following ability can be cast with a defensive auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
        - In order for it to act as such, it must be targeted onto the ground, not directly onto a target
    • For example, <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284> on ground → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:wm:535533809978966037>

⬥ Avoiding weak abilities when staff camping
    • When camping staff, the lack of abilities at your disposal means it is possible you may have to fall back on weak basics such as Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> or Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>
        - Replace such abilities with Defensive + 2H Auto

> **__Switches__**
.tag:Switches
This section will detail several switches that are useful for magic, and should be incorporated as comfortable and when relevant

.
**__Juggling__** <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> / <:soa:869284271595069451>
⬥ This is simply referring to making use of both dual wields and 2H, rather than camping one or the other

.
⬥ This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to both Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> and Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136>
    • This new filler ability aids in managing cooldowns and increasing overall damage output
    • Moreover, it gives you all the benefits that camping either would provide to you

.
⬥ This is a good stepping stone for those that wish to move away from weapon camping but are either not willing or not confident enough to 4TAA

.
**__Guthix Staff/Zamorak Staff__** <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651>
⬥ This is a basic switch to incorporate into rotations, and is beneficial to do so where possible
    • This is generally speaking bosses where you require the affinity debuff or if you have excess adrenaline to dump

⬥ When an Essence of Finality <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> is acquired, <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> should generally be placed into it immediately

.
⬥ The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack

.
⬥ There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows:
    • It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack
        - This brings the adrenaline cost from 25% to 22.5%.
    • If **not** using <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>, and you have Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> stacks

.
⬥ 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> to Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> or Zamorak Staff <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651>, which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> in the same tick
    • Once again, this is never required if using <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:eofpurple:780401412936040478>
    • 0-ticking works because the game only checks if Aftershock is equipped at the end of a tick
    • Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> → <:spec:537340400273195028> → Weapon B

.
⬥ If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability)
    • Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:spec:537340400273195028> → equip Weapon B
        - If you do not wish to 0-tick your spec, then you do not need to do the weapon swap at the end on the same tick

.
**__Planted Feet__** <:pf:689501925770919981>
⬥ This is a very strong switch that requires minimal effort to incorporate

.
⬥ This perk increases the duration of Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT)
    • It makes Sunshine's <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0→51) to 64t/38.4s total (t0→t63)

.
⬥ Generally, always Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> with your Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch

.
⬥ Common choices for a planted feet switch include a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> or an Enhanced Excalibur <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727>
    • Placing it on a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> can potentially save an inventory space, as your shield is now also your planted feet switch
    • Placing it on an Enhanced Excalibur <:EnhancedExcalibur:513200949016264727> also saves an inventory space wherever you would normally bring it
        - Many bosses do not require a shield at all, in this case, Enhanced Excalibur potentially saves a space where a defender would not
        - It also means you can use the same switch for both Ranged and Magic
        - It is slightly more involved to use: requires clicking on ground so as not to be dragged into melee distance
    • Planted feet can also be put on a cheap wand, though this is not generally recommended

.
**__Flanking__** <:flank4:712073088296157185>
⬥ This is a simple, yet strongly recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing group-based content

.
⬥ This turns Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> and Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant
    • It increases Minimum of Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> by 8% per Flanking rank and its Max by 40% per Flanking rank
    • It increases Minimum of Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> by 6% per Flanking rank and its Max by 30% per Flanking rank
        - Flanking Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> is still not generally prioritized due to the availability of stronger thresholds

.
**__Caroming__** <:caroming4:791281588792590336>
⬥ This is a more niche switch; however, in such cases it can be highly effective
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/DCta1YP.mp4
.
⬥ This perk adds an additional target per rank to the Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> and Chain <:chain:535533833056026624> abilities
    • With Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336> this means a total of 6 targets
    • This is mostly beneficial to Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672>, as a combination of <:caroming4:791281588792590336> <:gchain:787904334495088672> and strong abilities such as Igneous Omnipower <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> <:omni:535533809664262179> can be massively effective at clearing mobs
        - The perk only needs to be equipped when casting Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672>, **not** when casting the follow-up ability

.
⬥ It is recommended to put this perk on either an off-hand switch, or a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781>
    • A defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> will produce lower damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672> but can save an inventory space
        - Consider combining <:caroming4:791281588792590336> and <:pf:689501925770919981>
        - Lower damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672> is generally not very detrimental, as the damage from the follow-up ability is what generates the largest portion of the resulting AoE damage
    • Using an off-hand switch can be cheaper and higher damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672>, however it will almost certainly cost an inventory space

.
⬥ A Caroming <:caroming4:791281588792590336> switch is recommended for
    • Elite Dungeons <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>
    • Arch-Glacor
    • Tzkal-Zuk
    • Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857>

.
**__Kerapac's Wrist Wraps__** <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940>
⬥ If an enemy is not susceptible to Cinderbane gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>, these gloves are generally the best alternative
    • Temporarily equipping them at poisonable content to gain their effect will be a DPM increase, though this is not commonly done
    • Can be upgraded to T90 Enhanced Kerapac's wrist wraps using 1000 Glacor Remnants <:glacorremnants:884739993527013376>, and a Leng Artefact <:lengartefact:884739993543782420>

.
⬥ If equipped when casting <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, the next <:comb:535533833098100745> to hit within 10t of the <:dbreath:535533833391702017> cast will have its remaining hits instantly apply at 25% more damage
    • Within 10t meaning if <:dbreath:535533833391702017> is cast t0, <:comb:535533833098100745> has to hit within t0-9, meaning latest you can cast <:comb:535533833098100745> is t7
    • The effect applies both in cases where <:dbreath:535533833391702017> is cast before <:comb:535533833098100745>, and vice versa
    • The remaining hits will be separate hitsplats, rather than one large hit

.
⬥ This effect will work in synergy with related <:comb:535533833098100745> effects, notably:
    • Walking
        - This will require precision: target must be walked on the same tick as <:comb:535533833098100745> is cast
    • Lunging Perk <:lunge4:736522494315593759>
    • Extra 2 hits granted if used within 10s of <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>

.
**__Dragonrider Amulet__** <:drider:656785090994503700>
⬥ This switch becomes less important as you acquire more powerful amulets
    • That said, unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, even with an Essence of Finality (or) <:eofor:745279787471470713> equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch

.
⬥ This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • It boosts its damage by 10%
    • It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's <:dbreath:535533833391702017> max hit rounded down per hit
        - This excludes boosts that do not normally boost bleeds

.
**__Seren Godbow__** <:sgb:626466665848242186>
⬥ This is an advanced switch to incorporate into rotations, though it is highly beneficial to do so where it is worth it
    • this is generally speaking bosses that are 5x5 in size or larger

.
⬥ The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack

.
⬥ There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows:
    • You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) <:ingen:641339234111848463> to ensure the special attack does not splash
        - If you do not, depending on the content done, you may have to remove several pieces of armor to reduce the odds of splashing
    • It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack
        - This brings the adrenaline cost from 30% to 27%
    • It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish <:anguish:583429936665198592> or Desolation <:Desolation:513190159018098713>.
        - This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen <:ingen:641339234111848463>, but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario

.
⬥ If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability)
    • This is worth noting as it is a heavy input sequence to execute in a single tick:
<:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:vigour:615613235512737792> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → <:anguish:583429936665198592>/<:Desolation:513190159018098713> → <:ingen:641339234111848463> → <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> is first and the Special <:spec:537340400273195028> is last

.
> **__4TAA__**
.tag:4TAA
**__What it is__**
⬥ 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA), is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before

.
⬥ As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown
    • 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (staff) ability

.
⬥ So to 4TAA, we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and thus auto) binds
    • We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick

.
**__How it Works__**
⬥ The general 4TAA structure without Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> will be like:
```
2H Auto + 2H/DW Ability → non-channelled DW Ability → (if DW Ability w/ Auto) Staff Swap → Repeat
```
⬥ The general 4TAA structure with gConc <:gconc:869285393223254107> will be:
```
Method A: 2H Auto + 2H/DW Ability → gConc → non-channelled DW Ability → (if DW Ability w/ Auto) Staff Swap → Repeat

OR

Method B: 2H Auto + gConc  → DW Ability → non-channelled DW Ability → Staff Swap → Repeat
```
⬥ The difference between having <:gconc:869285393223254107> and not having <:gconc:869285393223254107> are as follows:
    • Instead of generally autoing every 2 abilities (7 ticks), it is every three abilities (10 ticks)
    • In other words, ensure that you maximize <:gconc:869285393223254107> casts by using it every 3rd ability
        - Additionally, <:gconc:869285393223254107> is always followed by a dual-wield ability, this is because swapping mainhands loses the <:gconc:869285393223254107> crit buff
    • When you want to use Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (which ideally is 2-hit) it is the ability before <:gconc:869285393223254107>

.
⬥ As you can see, when not using <:gconc:869285393223254107>, the auto is forced every other ability. This is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability

.
⬥ Further, you can see the ability before it repeats (i.e., before you do your next auto + ability) has to be a non-channelled DW ability
    • It *must* be a DW ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later
    • It *must* be non-channelled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown
        - Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channelled ability, or at the very least do not do a channel before you intend to auto

.
⬥ Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either a 2H or DW ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perking and tiers
    • That being said, you *must* (outside of very niche cases without <:gconc:869285393223254107>) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channelled, that the channelled ability is done with DW (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, as Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> is already DW locked, and Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372> is not relevant)
        - This is because of the fact that when the channelled hits it incurs your auto cd, it is going to incurs it based off the weapon you are wearing, thus if you staff <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, when your <:asphyx:535533833072672778> ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown again
        - The table below will showcase two different scenarios:
```
2H Asphyxiate:

You MUST do:
Auto + Asphyxiate → Ability → DW Ability → Auto + Ability

DW Asphyxiate:

You can do:
Auto + Asphyxiate → DW Ability → Auto + Ability
```
*Note: this is not an issue if you do auto + ability → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → non-channelled DW ability → repeat structure, given the fact you are already planning to auto 2 abilities after <:asphyx:535533833072672778>*

**__Video Guide by <@162317885044293632>__**
https://youtu.be/HmZR1BBwsK0

.
**__Text Based Guide__**
⬥ The basic principles is you can do lossless spellcasting by hitting a spell from action bar (lossless meaning you don't lose ticks performing the action)
    • This lets you auto the same tick as you use an ability (input is auto → ability)

.
⬥ When you can autoattack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: <:praeswand:643166769518739477> = 4t and <:soa:869284271595069451> = 6t

.
⬥  Your delay after an action is given by max(currentdelay, delay from action)
    • Implications from this are that if you do a wand ability you'll be able to autoattack 4 ticks after. If you do a staff ability, you will be able to autoattack 6 ticks after

.
**__Step-By-Step 4TAA Walkthrough__**
⬥ Things you need:
    • Wand + Orb <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
    • Staff <:soa:869284271595069451>
    • Runes <:Airrune:536252658986647589>
    • An ability bar with the basic abilities:
        - Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>, Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and a couple other basic abilities
        - Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
        - Auto Attack (such as <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>)
*Note 1: <:wrack:856662355952795658> is being used for practice solely due to its short cooldown, in actual PvM you should almost never be using this ability*
*Note 2: <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is being used only for demonstration and cheap rune cost, replace as desired when PvMing*

.
⬥ As touched on earlier, there are two fundamental patterns to 4TAA revolving around Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • Method A will be: 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + DW/Staff ability → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → DW ability → Repeat
    • Method B will be: 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:gconc:869285393223254107> → DW/Staff ability → DW ability → Repeat

.
**__Method A__**
**1.** Equip DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>, acquire target, and Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
**2.** Equip Staff <:soa:869284271595069451>, wait 1 tick after GCD, then (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:sonic:535533809924571136>) in that order on the same tick
**3.** Equip DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>, and Gconc <:gconc:869285393223254107>
**4.** DW Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
**5.** Repeat from step 2

**__Method B__**
**1.** Equip DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>, acquire a target, and Gconc <:gconc:869285393223254107>
**2.** Cast a basic ability, for example, Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> (prefer DW to retain crit buff)
**3.** DW Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
**4.** Equip Staff <:soa:869284271595069451>, wait 1 tick after GCD, then (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + equip DW + <:gconc:869285393223254107>) in that order on the same tick
**5.** Repeat from step 2

**__4TAA Additional Info__**
⬥ It can be helpful to practice on a combat dummy set to max hit mode, in order to more easily track whether or not you are properly executing 2H autos
⬥ Ensure that for necessary steps, all required actions are done within a single tick
    • For example, from method B, actions in the parentheses must be executed in one tick, in a specific order: DW ability + Equip staff → **(** 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + equip DW + <:gconc:869285393223254107> **)**
    • To make this easier on yourself try keybinding your Wand/Orb/Auto in an easy to reach set of keybinds
    • Some players prefer to click their auto attacks instead of keybind them, or in some cases even click their weapons. Such alternatives can be explored at the player's discretion
⬥ You will know you did not lose any ticks between auto and abilities if you do not see the auto firing animation, but the auto itself still fires

.
> **__4TAA Troubleshooting__**
.tag:Aid
While practising you may be unsure if you are messing up or not, so the following clips will showcase various scenarios: too fast, correctly, and too slow

*Note: the Auto damage in all the following clips is 2515*

.
**__Too Fast__**
This means you simply did not wait the additional tick required for the auto, and so casted your ability at GCD end instead of 1 tick after GCD end to get an Auto + Ability
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/eYF30FV.mp4
.
**__Correctly__**
This means you did it correctly, this will demonstrate how it looks like in both Normals and Ancients Spellbooks
⬥ If you did not mess up on Normals, you will not get the Auto casting animation and you will see the auto still be fired out.

⬥ If you did not mess up on Ancients, you will not get the Auto casting animation.
    • As you can also see, the Auto and Ability are cast as the GCD bar flashes
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7NnF9f6.mp4
.
**__Too Slow__**
This means you were too late to cast your auto + ability, typically this results in a 5TAA (auto cast on tick 4, ability cast on tick 5), or worse (ability cast far later)

More specifically, it means your ability will be delayed as your auto will automatically fire on the 4th tick either way, assuming you did not off

> **__Fractured Staff of Armadyl__**
.tag:FSOA
*Note: Many variations of FSOA rotations exist, and crit RNG is involved. This is simply a reference to start from*

.
**__An Overview of FSOA Usage__**
⬥ The Staff of Armadyl's immensely powerful special attack, *Instability*, consists of two components:
    • An initial hit of 50%-200% ability damage
    • Firing an auto-attack when a critical hit is landed
        - The auto casts the tick the hit lands

.
⬥ Auto-attacks released by <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> can themselves crit. In such cases, auto-attacks will be fired recursively
    • Recursively-fired auto-attacks will only occur if the critical hit lands on the primary target
        - Crits on additional targets (such as from <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>) will not trigger the effect
    • The damage of fired auto-attacks is determined by the equipped weapon when fired
        - For this reason, a 2H weapon should be preferred over dual-wields
    • Fired auto-attacks will not interrupt channelled abilities; however, they will incur auto-attack cooldown

.
⬥ Due to Instability being focused around critical hits, it has excellent synergy with Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> for adrenaline generation from both abilities and subsequent auto-attacks

.
⬥ The special attack costs 50% adrenaline, lasts for 30 seconds, and has a cooldown of 60 seconds

.
**__Key Considerations__**
⬥ An effective Staff of Armadyl <:soa:869284271595069451> rotation is made possible through landing critical hits with 2H equipped as often, and reliably as possible

⬥ As a result, Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931>, Erethdor's Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>, and a Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> are essential

⬥ A Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> is generally considered, at best, a marginal gain for Armadyl Battlestaff <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only. It is neither necessary, nor recommendable at its current price
    • It does not affect the crit chance of autos produced by channelled abilities
    • Generally, it is considered very low priority
    • Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> is significantly better than Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> if only one is camped

⬥ Generally, <:gconc:869285393223254107> is the only dual-wield ability worth using under spec
    • As touched on above, care should be taken so as not to equip dual-wields after abilities such as <:omni:535533809664262179>, or channelled abilities, as this can result in MH autos being fired even if the abilities themselves were cast with 2H
    • It is possible to <:gconc:869285393223254107> → ability + equip <:soa:869284271595069451> in that order, same-tick, to receive the <:gconc:869285393223254107> crit buff on the subsequent ability, and allow hit 3 of <:gconc:869285393223254107> and the subsequent ability to fire 2H autos if they crit

.
**__Basic Example Rotation__**
⬥ You can extend, modify, and improvise upon this rotation based on the particular situation and your crit RNG

⬥ Auto-cast is assumed to be Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> until at least Tsunami
    • Manual spellcasting is assumed to be enabled; therefore <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> is simply used to 4TAA

⬥ Usage of the Igneous Kal-Mej <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> and Conservation of Energy relic <:conservationofenergy:697808773711921195> are assumed

⬥ Once <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> is active, preferably use 2H for all abilities
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> can be used to build adren mid-spec, keeping in mind the limitations specified above
    • Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> will always crit each of its 4 hits
        - This means it will fire at least 4 auto-attacks
        - It will also generate a large amount of guaranteed adrenaline under Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>

.
<:Sunshine:583430011948630016> <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → (optional strong basic, i.e. <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>) → <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> → (<:gconc:869285393223254107> if needed) → <:soa:869284271595069451> (<:limitless:641339233638023179> if needed) <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:omni:535533809664262179> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → Improvise

.
**__Spell Swapping__**
⬥ Swapping auto-cast spells during an FSOA rotation can provide a host of benefits depending on the situation. Swapping will generally occur after necessary Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> stacks are achieved for Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>
    • Swapping to Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, especially in AOE situations, can provide an immense amount of healing. As well, its fast hit timing can mean additional auto-attacks fitting within buffs from <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, <:tsunami:535533809995874304>, or <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> itself
    • Camping Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> allows Frost Surge procs during <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>, which have a chance to crit and subsequently fire auto-attacks
    • Swapping to Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> allows for ability casts to build stacks that can benefit any usages of <:gconc:869285393223254107> under <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>
        - It may also grant more efficient access to <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> after the spec has finished

.
