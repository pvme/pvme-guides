This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritisation, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.
.
For general PvM terminology, DPS tips, and revolution bars, check out their respective sections in <#1252196386452144249>

.
## > __Ability Prioritisation__
.tag:priority
⬥ Generally, high damaging abilities should be prioritised and used more often than low damaging abilities.
⬥ To compare abilities, use [RS Analysis' Magic Page](<https://rs-analysis.xyz/magic.html>), and add your gear.
.
*Note: This does **not** give an ability rotation, only a damage comparison chart. It does not consider Ability Cooldowns, Adrenaline, or any specific PvM encounter.*

.
## __Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__
.tag:camping
While this compares strictly camping dual-wield vs. camping 2H, **it is recommended to juggle** for endgame mage, as it gives access to all the following benefits and more.

While this guide provides DPM guidance for various stages of upgrades, it does **not** focus on gearing and upgrade order itself. See __*Related Channels*__ at the bottom for links to upgrade order.
.
### Dual Wield Camp Benefits <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:odetodeceit:1266417683058917517>
⬥ Has access to the more powerful Sanctum dual-wield weapons, which provide a stronger damage boost when camped.
⬥ Easier to use switches.
    ● Can use <:merciless:1102553021457645579> or off-hand switches like Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> easier, as no extra main hand switch is required.

.
### Staff Camp Benefits <:noxstaff:513190159294922753>
⬥ Can be more revolution-friendly, such as for Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> tasks or AFK grinding methods.
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, which are much stronger than dual-wield autos.
    ● When 2H camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>.

.
## > __Building a Magic Rotation__
.tag:rotation
.
⬥ Similar to other styles, a typical Magic rotation uses the strongest basics available to build adrenaline, and spends it on the strongest available thresholds, ultimates, or special attacks.
    • To achieve this, we must think about the following **key considerations:**
        ⬩ Ability Cooldowns
        ⬩ Adrenaline
        ⬩ Spell Effects <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> <:incitefear:856635090783567902>
        ⬩ Boss HP and phases
    • If these considerations are well accounted for, you will be able to improvise rotations effectively.

*Note 1: If Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is not unlocked, use the regular version <:conc:1087373968731811880> below
Note 2: This section does not go over the use of Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:fsoa:869284271595069451> in rotations
See __**Advanced Rotations**__ section further down for info on magic rotations with best-in-slot gear.*

.
### Basic Pattern
⬥ **Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> should form the foundation of your rotation**.
    ● Aside from being the ideal filler ability, it also provides a critical strike chance buff on the following ability
.
⬥ **The basic pattern uses <:gconc:869285393223254107> often, in 'blocks' of 3 abilities**:
    ● **[** <:gconc:869285393223254107> → Ability → Ability **]** → Repeat
.
⬥ When building adrenaline, fill the empty slots with strong basics like the following, prioritising those that can critically strike immediately after <:gconc:869285393223254107>:
    ● Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836>
    ● Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290>
    ● Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    ● Impact (Flanking) <:impactflank:867678154369400862>
    ● Wrack <:wrack:1257439366708592651>
    ● Combust (Walked) <:comb:535533833098100745>
    ● Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>
*Note: <:comb:535533833098100745> and <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> cannot critically strike but are still strong abilities.*
⬥ Once your rotation gets going, you can start using abilities like thresholds or better to fill in the blanks.

.
### Sunshine
*Note: It is assumed that either the Planted Feet perk <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> or Greater Sunshine unlock has been obtained <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> for the purposes of this guide.*
.
⬥ Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> lasts 38.4 seconds, but only has a 60 second cooldown. **We want to prioritise building to 100% adrenaline and using Sunshine often, as it boosts damage by 50%.**
    ● The exception to this is when the fight would end too quickly, or mechanics occur, and you can't benefit from the full duration.
    ● Ideally, enter boss fights with 100% adrenaline so you can activate it immediately at the start.
.
⬥ Both in and out of Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, you will want to prioritise your strong thresholds, special attacks, and modified ultimates:
    ● Igneous Omnipower <:omnipowerigneous:1179505745654448208>
    ● Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>
    ● Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372>
    ● Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    ● Detonate <:detoboots:602581956072439828> <:deto:535533833358016512>
    ● Deep Impact (Flanking) <:deepimpactflank:867678153611018261>
    ● Iban's Staff (EoF) <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>
    ● Guthix Staff (EoF) <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>
    ● etc.
        ⬩ While under the effect of a crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> the use of basic abilities during <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> to build adrenaline can be greatly reduced.
⬥ A typical <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> rotation involves building adrenaline to push out <:wm:535533809978966037> + <:asphyx:535533833072672778> as early as possible to be able to use them a second time before <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> ends.
⬥ **While waiting for <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> cooldown, you can use a few more thresholds/etc.**
    ● You do not want to needlessly camp 100% adrenaline, and can start building when <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is nearly ready to use again.

.
### Tips
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Wrack <:wrack:1257439366708592651>, Sonic Wave <:sonicwave:1087373972443775056>, or Concentrated Blast <:conc:1087373968731811880> is considered a weak ability and should be avoided when possible. Sometimes you may be forced to use them. Don't sweat it too much.
    ● Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>
    ● Chain <:chain:1257440203401068566>
    ● Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>
    ● Impact (no Flank) <:impact:535533809655873556>
    ● Combust (not walked) <:comb:535533833098100745>
.
⬥ The critical strike chance buff gained through <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:1087373968731811880> is wasted if the follow-up ability cannot crit <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> / <:comb:535533833098100745>
⬥ Keep in mind that Asphyx <:asphyx:535533833072672778> and Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> are channelled abilities and should be cancelled with the next ability after 8 ticks, or **during the last segment of their channel bars.**
    • <:asphyx:535533833072672778> is typically cancelled after 2 hits/3t if there are enough available abilities to fill out the rotation without the additional hits.
⬥ If using Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> is a good basic if the alternative is weaker than Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>.

.
## > __Spells and Autocast__ <:incitefear:856635090783567902>
.tag:whatspell
Magic spells can be set to *autocast*, which essentially 'selects' them to use with your abilities. Think of this like picking your ammo for a ranged weapon. When using abilities, stronger spells can increase your ability damage, similar to ranged ammo. If you don't press an ability, then the selected spell gets used for auto attacks.
.
### Important Notes:
⬥ All spells have a damage limit they can scale up to. For example, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is unlocked at level 81, but scales up to level 99, with the damage being capped by your weapon tier
    • This is important, because **your autocast must scale *at least* up to your weapon tier**
⬥ The element of a spell does not affect its damage, but it **can** affect hitchance if a monster is weak to that element
⬥ **Some spells like <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> or <:incitefear:856635090783567902> will only give their passive benefits if selected as autocast**
.
### What Autocast to Use
⬥ To autocast a spell, right-click it in your spellbook and select 'autocast'
⬥ Generally you should be autocasting either Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> or alternatively Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> if you plan to use Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>
    • Advanced rotations aim to swap between both to upkeep the effects of both spells
⬥ If the City of Senntisten quest is not completed, use Blood Blitz/Barrage <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>/ <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>
⬥ If on the standard/normal spellbook, use the highest rank of air spell available <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> (assuming hitchance is not a concern)
.
### Debuff Spells
⬥ You should always have Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> and Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> applied wherever bosses are not immune to the effects
⬥ It is preferred to use Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> instead of the spell as they are lossless
⬥ Use Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> if you need a long bind while on the Standard spellbook
.
### Autoattacks
.
⬥ It is possible to autocast one spell but use another spell to manually cast magic autos, such as with 4-tick Auto Attacks (4TAA) or defensive autos. Use `!defauto` and `!4taa` to learn more, or see the __**4TAA**__ section.
⬥ Usually done to keep autocast set to <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> or <:incitefear:856635090783567902> while still gaining the benefits of <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> or <:icebarrage:537340400185245701>

⬥ **Important: Manual spellcasting must be enabled for this to work**, otherwise inputting a spell will also change your autocast to that spell
    • Use `!manualspellcasting` to learn more
⬥ All instances of auto-attacks in rotations should be cast with staff unless otherwise specified.

.
## > __General Sunshine Rotations__ <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
.tag:sun
**This section will cover usage of strong abilities (thresholds or better) within your Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> under different scenarios.**

**The following unlocks are assumed**:
⬥ Ring of Vigour <:rov:513201065877831680> or its passive effect after [Extinction quest](https://runescape.wiki/w/Extinction).
⬥ Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> used for Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>.
⬥ Essence of Finality <:eof:787526151978614824> with an adrenaline dump spec such as <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> or <:gstaff:513203008608141314>
.
**Keep in mind the following:**
⬥ These are only suggestions work from, and will not necessarily be applicable at all bosses or situations.
    ● For boss-specific rotations, see their respective guides.
⬥ Conservation of Energy relic <:conservationofenergy:697808773711921195> is recommended for adrenaline refunds from <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> , <:omni:535533809664262179> , and <:tsunami:535533809995874304> in order to execute a stronger rotation. Heightened Senses <:heightenedsenses:697808773573771344> can be used at lower <:archaeology:941211288665739274> levels but begins to fall behind once <:incitefear:856635090783567902> and <:igneouskalmej:1153772938252787793> are obtained.
⬥ Damage-over-time abilities in the rotations in this guide use <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, although a **walked** <:comb:535533833098100745> will do more damage if the option to walk is available.

.
### Sunshine Examples
*Manual auto-attacks are indicated with <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and can be cast by inputting <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + ability in that order on the same tick.
Autocast spells are indicated in parenthesis (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>), if not indicated then a specific autocast is not required for the rotation.
You may interchange <:wrack:1257439366708592651> and <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> casts with <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> if it is owned. However, it is not recommended to purchase <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> before <:fsoa:869284271595069451>.
Rotations including Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> were tested with Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> + Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931> at 23% critical strike chance.*

All of the above rotations have stretches of filler globals, such as <:gconc:869285393223254107> and <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, intended to build adrenaline and fill the space between stronger cooldowns. With a crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>, such as Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>, many of these globals can potentially be replaced by stronger adrenaline dumps such as <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, <:omni:535533809664262179>, and <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028>, while leaving much of the adrenaline-building to <:gconc:869285393223254107> and the crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>.

Rotations, especially those without <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, can still be further improved by <:impatient:848803118706720798> / <:relentless5:712244800920748092> procs, <:divert:787904334377648130>, <:hydrixbakri:550834403136503822> <:grico:787904334812807238>, <:limitless:641339233638023179>, and/or <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> improvisation.

## > __Important Ability Mechanics__
.tag:importantabil
Certain Magic abilities are worth noting in particular, due to their behaviour and how they can be used. Here, we cover some of these abilities.

.
### __Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>__
⬥ Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is an upgraded version of regular Concentrated Blast <:conc:1087373968731811880> that remains a channelled ability, but has increased damage, and **all 3 hits can be used within 3t/1.8s, or 1 global cooldown**.
⬥ **This is the strongest magic basic ability available**
⬥ It has **good synergy with stacking spells like Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> and Incite Fear** <:incitefear:856635090783567902>, crit effects such as Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and Fractured Staff of Armadyl special attack <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>

.
### __Detonate__ <:deto:535533833358016512>
⬥ Pressing <:deto:535533833358016512> once charges the ability, and pressing <:deto:535533833358016512> again releases it, dealing AoE damage.
    ● Takes 4t/2.4s to reach 100% with Blast Diffusion Boots <:detoboots:602581956072439828>, 6t/3.6s otherwise.
    ● AoE radius depends on charge % - see reference image: <https://img.pvme.io/images/KP6RCFz4ym.png>.
⬥ **<:deto:535533833358016512> is centred differently with and without a target**:
    ● If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> without a target, it is centred on your player.
    ● If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> with a target, it is centred on that target's coordinate **at the time charging started**.
        ⬩ If a target is 2x2 or larger, this is their **southwest tile**.
⬥ If a selected target dies while detonate is still being cast:
    ● If you target cycle to another target, the detonate will remain centred on the original (dead) target's coordinate.
    ● If you do not target cycle, the centre will be shifted to your player coordinate.

.
⬥ The initial charge of <:deto:535533833358016512> acts like a defensive in the context of defensive autos.
    ● Auto cooldown is not incurred until its release, meaning you can release it with an auto and the next ability in your rotation.
        ⬩ Example: <:deto:535533833358016512> (charge) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:deto:535533833358016512> (release) + <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
        ⬩ The hit timing and input order here are crucial: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:deto:535533833358016512> + <:wm:535533809978966037> must be executed in that order, on the same tick.
.
⬥ You can do the following while charging <:deto:535533833358016512>, *without interrupting the ability*:
    ● Switch weapons <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
    ● Throw bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>
    ● Spellbook swap <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154> (the following spell will still cancel <:deto:535533833358016512>)
⬥ You can stall the release of <:deto:535533833358016512>.

### Known Issues with Detonate
⬥ Sometimes, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15%.
    ● This can be explained as follows: the game thinks you both have and don't have a target at the same time, so it uses adrenaline from both your target and the adrenaline inherently used from using it without a target.
    ● To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>.
⬥ Casting Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> on the same tick your target dies will cancel the charge completely.

.
### __Greater Chain__ <:gchain:1257440278512537740>
*Note: For a brief summary, use `!gchain`*.
⬥ <:gchain:1257440278512537740> is an upgraded version of <:chain:1257440203401068566>. It hits the target, as well 2 additional targets within a 6 tile radius. **These targets then taken 50% damage from the next ability used on the main target**.
    ● With Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336>, the number of additional targets hit with <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> can be increased up to 6.
⬥ If the main target dies, this effect will be lost.
⬥ Use a powerful ability on the main target like <:gchain:1257440278512537740> → <:omni:535533809664262179>, or with high hitting special attacks such as <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028>
⬥ Using damage-over-time abilities like <:comb:535533833098100745> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> will apply their full damage to all targets, rather than only 50%.
⬥ It can be used to briefly stun multiple targets with stun abilities such as <:impact:535533809655873556> and <:deep:535533833139912724> , however Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> will not stun secondary targets.

### Notes
⬥ Chaining effect does not apply to the following abilities:
    ● Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290>
    ● Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    ● Reprisal <:Reprisal:513190159462694912>
    ● Shatter <:shatter:536256673904328704>

⬥ These abilities work but will damage you for each additional target:
    ● Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372>
    ● Onslaught <:onsl:513190159085207555>

.
### __Magma Tempest__ <:magmatempest:902209626509025290>
⬥ Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> is an ability unlocked by reading the [Magma Tempest Ability Codex](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magma_Tempest_ability_codex), and deals continuous damage in a 5x5 area for 8 hits over 9.6 seconds.
⬥ Has a targeted <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284> variant that allows you to cast it onto a selected ground tile, which does not require a targeted enemy to be cast.
    • Good for setting up a bit of damage before an enemy has spawned or for enemies that are still walking into range, but this variant does **not** build a stack of <:incitefear:856635090783567902> or <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
⬥ Notably, Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> deals damage over time, but is not considered a DoT for the purposes of Sanctum dual wield weapons <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> or Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> boost
    • This means that it does not build <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> stacks, but does receive the damage boost from <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, unlike other DoTs <:comb:535533833098100745> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>
    • This makes it a decently strong ability in <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> and, if used beforehand, the damage will adjust after receiving the <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> buff.

.
### __Guthix Staff/Zamorak Staff/Iban Staff Special Attack__ <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752>
⬥ These are amongst the first options that magic users should get for their EoF <:eof:787526151978614824>
    ● <:gstaff:513203008608141314> (25% adren) increases affinity by +2 for 1 minute → this is a great way to effectively increase hitchance
    ● <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> (25% adren) lowers the target's magic level by 5% (of the previous value) and lowers its accuracy by 5% for 1 minute
    ● <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> (50% adren) has no secondary effect but deals much higher damage at the cost of more adrenaline
.
⬥ Iban's <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> is **mainly worth using after <:gconc:869285393223254107>**, as it has the highest average damage increase from <:gconc:869285393223254107>'s critical strike chance boost
    • i.e. if adrenaline is available for <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, it's generally worthwhile to wait for the next <:gconc:869285393223254107> to cast it

.
### __Armadyl Battlestaff (ABS) EoF__ <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eof:787526151978614824>
⬥ The special attack of the Armadyl Battlestaff (ABS) <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512>, *Tempest of Armadyl*, is a channel that lasts 5t/3s, dealing 45-55% ability damage per tick, increasing by 5% per hit
⬥ It should only be used during <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> to fish for rapid critical strikes, but only breaks even with Iban's <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> if comboed with all critical strike chance buffs and Channeler's ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>.

.
### __Reaver's Ring vs Channeller's Ring__ <:reaverring:839903943018283050> <:channellerring:839903943404027914>
⬥ Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> grants +5% critical strike chance on all hits, while Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> grants +4% critical strike chance on channelled ability <:gconc:869285393223254107>, stacking for each additional hit.
⬥ It may seem that Channeller's Ring pulls ahead due to the abundance of channelled abilities available to magic <:magic:689504724159823906>. However, the following should be considered:
    • Channeller's Ring does not buff Time Strike hits from FSoA's special attack <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • Some of magic's strongest abilities consist of <:omni:535533809664262179>, <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028>, <:wm:535533809978966037> which do not benefit from Channeller's Ring
    • <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> does not benefit from the critical strike chance portion of Channeller's Ring, whereas the subsequent guaranteed Time Strikes when using it during <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> benefit from Reaver's Ring.
.
⬥ Therefore, Reaver's Ring is recommended where hit chance is not an issue. However, choice of <:eof:787526151978614824> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> can also affect this decision, since <:reaverring:839903943018283050> synergises better with <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> while <:channellerring:839903943404027914> brings up the value of <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>.

## Autoattacks
.tag:autos
### Defensive Autos
While colloquially referred to as 'defensive' autos, they may also be called 'non-damaging' or 'free' autos, since some non-defensive abilities interact the same way. Examples include Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> and Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>.
For a thorough explanation of how defensive autos (and auto attacks in general) work, refer to <#1020550458231771157>. Here, we will simply cover some of their uses.
.
### Why Defensive Autos Exist
⬥ Generally, casting any ability will put your auto-attack <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> on cooldown based on your weapon speed.
⬥ However, **non-damaging abilities do not cause this cooldown.**
    ● This means that defensive autos can be used within your main ability rotation.
⬥ Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> in particular can keybind auto attacks by dragging spells on to the ability bar. This makes for some interesting gameplay mechanics.
⬥ They should **always** be used where applicable since they are simply free damage

.
### Common Applications
⬥ **Autoing with Sunshine** <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>.
    ● Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is a non-damaging ability, giving a defensive auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> with the next ability:
        ⬩ <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    ● This can also be used to apply Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> but can be used for other debuffs like Vuln <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or Enfeeble <:Enfeeble:567727986409734145> etc.
.
⬥ **Rapidly casting autos for utility or adren-building.**
    ● Spamming multiple defensives with a target selected and using dual-wield can also generate adrenaline faster, since auto-attacks provide adren if they hit a target.

      }
    ]
  }

.
⬥ As mentioned before, **casting auto-attacks or damaging abilities will put your auto-attack <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> on cooldown**:
    ● Staff abilities place it on a 6t (3.6s) cooldown.
    ● Dual wield abilities place it on a 4t (2.4s) cooldown.
⬥ Combining these, we get 4TAA: **using an ability with wand/orb and delaying the next ability by one tick, to force an auto and ability together on the 4th tick.**
.
⬥ 2H autos are multiple times stronger than DW autos, therefore:
    • **Damaging 4-tick autos <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> are almost always staff autos**
    • **Non-damaging 4-tick autos <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> can be cast with either staff or dual wield**
⬥ The basic 4TAA structure is: non-channelled DW Ability → 2H auto + ability → continue.
    ● The ability before the auto **must** be a non-channelled DW so that a 4-tick auto cooldown is incurred.

.
⬥ With Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> unlocked, it is important to ensure its usage is not delayed. This means that 4TAA in rotations will be structured using two types of patterns. Both patterns are built in groups of three abilities, with one <:gconc:869285393223254107> and one 2H auto per group.
    ● **Method A**: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + DW/Staff ability → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → non-channelled DW ability → Repeat
    ● **Method B**: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:gconc:869285393223254107> → DW/Staff ability → non-channelled DW ability → Repeat

### Common Mistakes and Tips
⬥ **Going too fast**
    ● Not waiting for 1t delay after global cooldown ends will prevent the auto from being cast.
⬥ **Going too slow**
    ● If you delay longer than 1t it usually results in a 5TAA, delaying the auto/ability (lost ticks), which is a large DPS loss.
⬥ **When done correctly, you will see the auto attack fired with no animation**.
⬥ Use proper, easy-to-reach keybinds as some steps require you to perform multiple actions in one tick.
⬥ Despite not being channelled abilities, <:tsunami:535533809995874304> and <:omni:535533809664262179> do not allow for 4TAA afterwards.

      }

}

.
⬥ Most of the time, your rotations will only include a few instances of 4TAA per cycle of Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> due to magic having plenty of strong abilities to fill the duration of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>.
⬥ Using 4TAA to apply <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> **before** <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is generally more efficient than waiting until <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> to apply it with a defensive auto i.e. <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> → <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + ability. This is because ticks outside of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> are less valuable in terms of damage and adrenaline gain.

.
### Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:fsoa:869284271595069451>
.tag:fsoa
⬥ The FSOA's special attack, *Instability*, costs 50% adrenaline, has a 60 second cooldown, and has two effects:
    ● An initial hit of 120-140% ability damage
    ● For 30 seconds, fires a **Time Strike for every critical strike** on the primary target, dealing 90-110% ability damage
        ⬩ They **can** themselves crit but will **not** fire another Time Strike if they do (no recursion)
        ⬩ They **are boosted by** <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
.
⬥ Where possible, you will overlap <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> + <:tsunami:535533809995874304> <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> + <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> to get the most out of each effect.
.
### Key Considerations
⬥ An effective <:fsoa:869284271595069451> rotation relies on **landing critical strikes as often and reliably as possible.**
⬥ Stack as much of Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931>, Erethdor's Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>, either Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> or Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>, Kal'gerion demon familiar <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> with scrolls <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049>, and Anima Core of Sliske <:animahelmsliske:643120082398085158> with the Tuska's Wrath effect selected as possible.

.
### Example Rotation
Fundamentally, <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotations follow the same general principles as before: using <:gconc:869285393223254107> and strong abilities as often as possible, but also overlapping <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> with <:tsunami:535533809995874304> <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> to get as many critical strikes as possible. Doing so will result in enough adrenaline refunds that <:gconc:869285393223254107> will ideally be the only basic ability used during this time.
.
⬥ <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> is a strong ability at the start of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> since we don't have our crit buffs running at the time, replace with <:dbreath:535533833391702017> if not owned.
    • Without <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, however, it may be a better decision to <:divert:787904334377648130> at the start for adrenaline.
⬥ When running into adrenaline issues, <:limitless:641339233638023179> + <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> guarantees at least 4 critical strikes and that <:gconc:869285393223254107> will be available immediately after.
⬥ Swapping between <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> and <:incitefear:856635090783567902> to maintain stacks of both spells allows us to boost the damage of Time Strikes and also fish for more critical strikes through <:incitefear:856635090783567902> procs.

.
**Example:**

(<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2-hit) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:omni:535533809664262179> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (charge) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:deto:535533833358016512> (release) + <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> → (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2-hit) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> (stop here if wanting to maintain high adrenaline) → <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>

.
⬥ Note that once we reach maximum stacks of <:incitefear:856635090783567902> and <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, we proceed to swap between them to allow <:incitefear:856635090783567902> to proc on its 12s cooldown.
⬥ Rotations will typically require a bit of improvisation. <:omni:535533809664262179> and <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> timings can be flexible since their cooldowns only allow them to be used once. Making sure to keep an eye on adrenaline and use <:limitless:641339233638023179> when necessary keeps the rotation flowing smoothly regardless.
    • The most likely timing to <:limitless:641339233638023179> for the example is to guarantee the <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372>
⬥ If multiple enemies are nearby, <:gchain:1257440278512537740> → <:omni:535533809664262179> / <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:wm:535533809978966037> provides a ton of additional chances for crit refunds, although Time Strikes will only proc off your main target.
.
⬥ ABS EoF <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> may also be used in place of other EoF options. However, it is recommended to always run it alongside Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>.
    • A proper <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> rotation usually only has room for one <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, so the choice mostly comes down to preference. If not using <:detoboots:602581956072439828> <:deto:535533833358016512>, more <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> may be required to pad out the rotation.
⬥ In the time outside <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, you are able to cast another set of <:wm:535533809978966037> + <:asphyx:535533833072672778> before having to build towards the next <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>.
    • <:omni:535533809664262179> can also be used on cooldown, although it may require <:divert:787904334377648130> to build adrenaline back up in time.
    • You may also plan to end <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> around 100% adrenaline and use <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> (slightly better due to <:corbicula:690136117273821280> perk) or <:incend:535541258429661215> to keep <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> active until the next <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
    • Make sure to set your autocast to <:incitefear:856635090783567902> before <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> if stacks were not maintained.

.tag:sanctdw
*Use `!sanctumdw` and `!essencecorruption` for a summary on their effects*

When utilising essence corruption effects, it's important to focus on the following:
⬥ Building <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> stacks during <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is inefficient, but a single DoT use is required to keep stacks from falling off.
    • The best option for this is <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> itself, since the first hit is not a DoT and is boosted by <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
⬥ Using a DoT <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> / <:comb:535533833098100745> immediately before <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> allows us to refresh <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> at around 15s remaining on <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
    • The usual timer is actually around 10s remaining, but the 30% chance for DoTs to instantly deal their damage combined with the travel time on <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> makes 15s the more consistent timing method.
.
⬥ The <:comb:535533833098100745> boost granted by <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> also lasts 15s, meaning it's possible to <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> → <:comb:535533833098100745> as <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> ends to make use of the buff without overlapping on <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> duration.

.
**Example:**

(<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> + <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:magmatempest:902209626509025290> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2-hit) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:omni:535533809664262179> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (charge) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:deto:535533833358016512> (release) + <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:wm:535533809978966037> → (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2-hit) → <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> → <:comb:535533833098100745>

.
⬥ The primary points to note in this example are:
    • The <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> DoT to maintain <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> right before <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
    • The timing of <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> in the back half to maintain stacks during <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
    • The <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> → <:comb:535533833098100745> right as <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> ends to make use of the Conflagrate buff
⬥ In this example, the timing of <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> is roughly as late is it can be used to upkeep <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> while accounting for the chance that <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> may instantly deal its damage. If the proc does not occur, you can <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> instead and proceed as usual.
        ⬩ You may opt to use the DoT <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> before <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> with <:fsoa:869284271595069451> equipped, or simply pay attention to the proc chance to account for this.
⬥ If you don't plan on using <:comb:535533833098100745> immediately after <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, you can shift around the timing of <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> as needed.

.
Notes:
⬥ Stacks of <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> are *not* maintained if <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> is not equipped when the DoT deals damage. This is important to know if you habitually immediately switch to <:fsoa:869284271595069451> to use <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>.
⬥ Resets on <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> during <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> can be optionally held until after <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> ends to have a filler option while waiting on the next <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>.
⬥ <:comb:535533833098100745> + <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> become good filler abilities outside of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, especially if you are not yet at 50 stacks.
⬥ Prebuilding with <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:gchain:1257440278512537740> → <:comb:535533833098100745> at the Wars dummies allows you to maintain stacks between kills of a boss, and build ~27 stacks quickly to activate the additional damage effect of <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> immediately.

### Without Adren Renewal <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>
⬥  With a best-in-slot magic <:magic:689504724159823906> setup, it's possible to circumvent the issue of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> rotations when <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> is on cooldown.
⬥  The following boosts and effects can be utilised to improve the consistency of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> + <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> without <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>:
        ⬩ Divert <:divert:787904334377648130> and/or Hydrix Grico <:hydrixbakri:550834403136503822> <:grico:787904334812807238> for a quick burst of adrenaline at the start of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
        ⬩ Limitless sigil <:limitless:641339233638023179> usage with <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> provides enough guaranteed critical strikes to proceed even with poor <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> luck.
        ⬩ Essence Corruption <:essencecorruption:1266418936820404295> 50-stack effect
        ⬩ Prior crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> running from <:meteorstrike:535532879359377439> or <:incend:535541258429661215>
        ⬩ Second EoF <:eof:787526151978614824> with <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> for lower-cost adrenaline dump, when <:ibansstaff:1215929543068618752> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> looks dicey to use.
        ⬩ 4TAA <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> to pad out the rotation while generating adrenaline.
⬥ In most scenarios, once you successfully put up <:tsunami:535533809995874304> + <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>, adrenaline for the rest of <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> can be sustained with good <:limitless:641339233638023179> timing and improvisation around <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>.

.
**Example (meant to demonstrate a sub-optimal adrenaline scenario):**

(<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> + <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:divert:787904334377648130> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → (4t) <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> → (<:limitless:641339233638023179>) <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2-hit) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:omni:535533809664262179> → <:roarofawakening:1266417538045317121> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (charge) → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> + <:deto:535533833358016512> (release) + (<:incitefear:856635090783567902>) <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (<:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>) <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> → <:comb:535533833098100745>

.
⬥ Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the sake of improvisation, such as slightly less efficient <:gconc:869285393223254107> usage, filling with 4TAA <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> and low-cost EoF specs <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, etc.
⬥ As long as you cast 2x <:wm:535533809978966037> + 2x <:asphyx:535533833072672778> + <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> + <:omni:535533809664262179>, while not using any basics worse than <:gconc:869285393223254107> or <:wrackandruin:1257439387474722836> after <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>, the <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> rotation can generally be considered successful.
⬥ These tips can also apply to <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> with <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538>, when dealing with poor stretches of <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> luck.
⬥ Of course, the rotation you can execute is highly dependent on the boss encounter, with bosses such as <:zamorak:994914159969976440> or <:kerapac:875443920673337344> allowing for much more frequent usage of <:gconc:869285393223254107>, multiple uses of <:omni:535533809664262179> per <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>, free adrenaline, and so on.
