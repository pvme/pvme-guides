.tag:intro
In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

> **__Revolution__**
.tag:Revo
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline.

.
⬥ While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance.

.
⬥ Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++, using this bar with 0 player input will yield ~130k DPM:

.
⬥ To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar:

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
⬥ Basic Revolution (commonly referred to as simply "Revolution") is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated.

.
⬥ Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities.

.
⬥ Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ihbsrD9.png
.
    • Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar − you will be manually activating them.

.
⬥ If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you.
    • Activate sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> once you reach 100% adrenaline.
        - From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, Deep Impact <:deepimpactflank:867678153611018261>). Repeat.

.
⬥ Following this simple repeating pattern of *Build to 100% → Sunshine → Thresholds → Repeat*, one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player.
    • No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player.

.
⬥ The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario.

.
⬥ Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate.
    • Refer to the revolution bars as examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice.

.
⬥ Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates.
    • The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe.
        - Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution.

.
⬥ An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy.
    • Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough.

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta).

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation__**
.tag:Priority
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns.
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again – during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities.

.
⬥ To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns.

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum):
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/BFrPlAE.png
.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind.

.
⬥ You want to make sure to prioritize usage of Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037> and Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> as these are your strongest thresholds, ideally you use them in your ultimate like Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, and generally they should the first couple thresholds you use. Further, if cooldowns and adrenaline permit outside of these cases they are of high priority too.

.
⬥ Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, flank Impact <:impactflank:867678154369400862>, and walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>.

.
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast <:sonic:535533809924571136>/<:conc:535533833106489365> would be considered a weak ability (Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, non-flank Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, single-target Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>).
    • Generally speaking, these should be avoided.

.
⬥ If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as often as possible in your rotation.
    • A basic pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

.
⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as filler abilities.
    • This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> → Ability → Repeat will give you strong dps.

        - It takes 4t (2.4s) to reach 100% instead of 6t (3.6s)
        - It gains 40% charge at a time instead of 20%.

.
**__Special Attacks__**
*Note: All Special Attacks have an inherent cooldown when doing back-to-back special attacks, this is discussed in <#689212192398114875>*

.
⬥ **Guthix Staff** <:gstaff:513203008608141314>
    • Adrenaline Cost: 25% (22.5% with <:vigour:615613235512737792>)
    • Its special attack applies an affinity and defence reduction:
        - +2 affinity
        - Reduces Defence level by 5% of base

.
**__Ultimates__**
⬥ **Sunshine** <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • Cooldown: 100t (60s)
    • It shares coodlown with Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>
    • It is an on cast buff
    • It increases damage by 50% from t0→t51 (52t/31.2s duration), where buff starts t1
    • It has a 7x7 buff radius
    • It does not incur the auto cooldown
    • It is affected by Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981>
        - Increases duration by 25%: duration becomes t0→t63 (64t/38.4s duration), where buff starts t1

.
⬥ **Metamorphosis** <:meta:535533811304497183>
    • Cooldown: 100t (60s)
    • It shares cooldown with Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>
    • It is an on hit buff
    • To get the buff the spell type of <:meta:535533811304497183> and the spell type of your abilities and autos have to correspond
        - E.g., Fire <:meta:535533811304497183> into Fire ability works, Fire <:meta:535533811304497183> into Air ability would not
    • It increases damage by 63.5% from t0-t25 (26t/15.6s duration), where buff starts t1
    • It does not incur the auto cooldown

.
⬥ **Omnipower** <:omni:535533809664262179>
    • Cooldown: 50t (30s)
    • It is affected by the Igneous Kal-Mej <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> and Igneous Kal-Zuk <:igneouskalzuk:902209626479685734>. These capes have the following effects:
        - Decrease adrenaline cost to 60%. The ability can also be activated at 60% adrenaline instead of 100%.
        - Ability fires 4 separate hits at the target, each dealing 90% - 180% ability damage.
        - Increases average ability damage from 300% to 540%.

.
⬥ **Tsunami** <:tsunami:535533809995874304>
    • Cooldown: 100t (60s)
    • It is an AoE
    • It provides an Critical Adrenaline buff:
        - For the next 30s, critical hits give 10% adrenaline
        - This buff is applied on release of the ability

.
**__Hit Timings__**
Refer to this table for hit timings of each ability

*Notes:*
⬥ *All distances mentioned assume Melee Distance (MD) is tile 1, so "8" = (MD + 7) tiles*

.
> **__What Spells to Use__**
.tag:whatspell
*Note: these are just general guidelines*

**__What Autocast to Use__**
⬥ Generally Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>
    • If you plan to utilize Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>, use Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> to get 5 stacks, then swap to <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>

⬥ If on Normals, use Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>

.
**__What Auto to Use__**
*Note: This refers to the auto on your bar you would be using for 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA) or Defensive Autos*

⬥ Generally Blood spells:
    • Barrage/Burst <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> / <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> if AoE or faster hit timings matter
    • Blitz/Rush <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> / <:bloodrush:839903691329896479> otherwise
        - Can use Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> instead if healing does not matter

⬥ Ice spells when you need or will benefit from the freeze:
    • Use Barrage/Burst <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> / <:iceburst:841419289797197824> or Blitz/Rush <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> / <:icerush:839903691234607136> following same logic for Blood spells

⬥ If on Normals, use Air Surge/Strike <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> / <:airstrike:895600427930910730>

*Note: the use of weaker spell variants is under the assumption manual spellcasting is used, use !manualspellcasting in <#534563158304620564> for more details*

.
**__Debuff Spells to Use__**
⬥ You should always have Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> applied, and generally you should always have Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> applied, unless the boss is immune to such conditions
    • You can also opt to Vulnerability bomb <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> the boss instead of using the spell
        - It saves an auto, albeit is more expensive
    • Immune creatures:
        - Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082>
        - Araxxor / Araxxi <:Araxxi:513213019543699466>
        - Rise of the Six <:karil:641696573272621086>
        - Sinister Fragments at Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>

⬥ Use Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> if you need the long bind and the fact that is does no damage is irrelevant

.
> **__Cancelling Channels__**
.tag:Cancel
**__Why to Cancel__**
⬥ Magic has 3 channeled abilities
    • These 3 are: Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, and Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ It is important to properly cancel abilities in order to not lose any ticks, as the animation can take longer than the actual channel takes to fully apply
    • Watch the following example of a Cancelled vs an Uncancelled channel (Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> in this scenario)
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/6uH4KVg.mp4
.
**__When to Cancel Channels__**
⬥ In almost all scenarios, you will cancel Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

.
⬥ Typically you will cancel your Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • To cancel on 3rd hit you would cancel on t5 (3s)
    • To cancel on 2nd hit you would cancel on t3 (1.8s)
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ For more information on cancelling, refer to <@145413546409197569>'s Video on cancelling
*Note: The Buff Bar timers are outdated in this video*

> **__Detonate__**
.tag:Deto
**__What Makes Detonate Unique__**
⬥ As mentioned, Magic has 3 channels; however, Detonate is often considered one too even if it technically is not one due to the need to charge it. This section will be dedicated to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> due to how differently it works compared to normal channels.

.
⬥ Unlike other channels, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> acts like or can have the following done within it:
    • It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> with an Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> given the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is not on cooldown)
    • You can throw Vulnerability Bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> during its charge time
    • You can SBS <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154> during its charge time
    • You can Shield Dome during its charge time
    • You can stall its release
        - Generally speaking you cannot stall channels (outside of melees wherein only 1 hit is stalled)
    • It is not affected by the Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> due to not actually being a channeled ability

.
⬥ Typically, when releasing Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> you will release it with an Auto and an Ability
    • An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave → Detonate (3t/1.8s) → Auto Deto Dragon Breath (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t/1.8s) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>)
        - The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> then Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> then Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/MTmP0BE.mp4
.
⬥ There is an odd occurence wherein Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15%
    • This can be explained as follows: the game thinks you both have a target and not at the same time, so it uses adrenaline from both your target and the adrenaline inherently used from using it without a target
        - To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before you hit Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>

.
⬥ Further, Detonate works like normal AoEs wherein it is centered at the true center of the target (for any >=2x2 target this will be the SW tile)
    • However, if you cast Detonate without a target, it will be centered on your player

.
⬥ Moreover, its worth keeping in mind the difference in AoE size dependent on the charge of deto on release, as represented in the following diagram:
.

> **__Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__**
.tag:DwVs2H
This section is meant to list the benefits of camping one over the other though it is strongly recommended to just juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits, and more.

.
**__Staff Camp Benefits__** <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
    • When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities
⬥ More Revolution-friendly
    • Due to using Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> over Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> is not a channeled ability.

.
**__Dual Wield Camp Benefits__** <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ Easier swapping
    • You can swap to Shield <:malevkite:513190159412625411> or Flanks <:flank4:712073088296157185> more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap

.
> **__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:DefAutos
*Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as "Defensive Autos", it is more technical to say it is non-damaging abilities, and so includes Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>.*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Typically, when you cast an ability it put your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with
    • i.e., if you cast an average speed (staff ability) it will be 6t (3.6s), if you cast a fastest speed (wand ability) it will be 4t (2.4s)

.
⬥ Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you cast one it will not put your auto on cooldown
    • This has several implications, the first applies to all styles, the second is magic specific

.
**__Implications__**
⬥ Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> or Entagle <:ent:567727987274022924>) *then* the defensive
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
.
```
T0: Wand Ability
T3: Defensive
T4: Auto is cast
T6: Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/YG0dSvD.mp4
.
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, as the cooldown for any Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all)
    • A further consideration, is if that ability on t6 is a non-channeled dw ability, you can 4tick an ability afterwards
        - This can be seen in the following video by <@593106625955495947>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw

.
⬥ Secondly, a benefit magic has, due to it having auto binds, is that you can make sure an auto + ability is cast on the same tick (rather than an auto is cast on 1 tick, and the ability a tick after)
    • This allows magic to do a 2H abil into a defensive auto as a result
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
```
T0: Staff Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/HI2ebR6.mp4
.
    • For Melee and Ranged this would result in:
```
T0: Average Speed 2H Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto
T7: Ability
```
    • This is important as it is highly beneficial to make use of this when staff camping, as it will aid in preventing you using bad abilities like Tuska's Wrath and Sacrifice due to the lack of abilities at your disposal

.
⬥ It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto
    • You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - If you wanted to change what the 2H auto is, you would have to 3 tick it

.
⬥ It is also important to note that if you click anything from your inventory, or click the ground anywhere, before the auto would naturally fire then you must re-click your target
    • With Magic, hitting your auto bind yields the same result

.
**__Delaying Defensive Auto__**
⬥ Based off this fact, you can make use of this if you need to delay a defensive auto for whatever reason
    • More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what *both* the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it
    • The following examples will be done with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>, however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast
    • For Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> specifically, we will "off" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto

.
⬥ There are several ways to "off" to delay the auto, these include:
    • Clicking under yourself
    • Clicking a spell you cannot cast (e.g., trying to cast Disruption Shield when on the Ancient Spellbook)
    • Clicking something from your inventory

.
*Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto.*

.
⬥ There are also a couple differences between hitting your auto bind to cast your auto and clicking to cast your auto after you "off", they are as follows:
    • You cannot hit your auto bind to try and recast your auto mid-GCD, you need to 3 tick it
    • If you use your auto bind to recast your auto, you can alter what the auto will be when you cast it
    • You can click to recast your auto mid-GCD
    • If you click to recast your auto, your next ability must be at least 1 tick after otherwise you will override it
        - if you click to recast your auto ideally you do it mid-GCD so that you do not waste ticks

.
.
⬥ Thus, for Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> we can do as follows:
    • Instead of the normal
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: 2H Auto cast
T6: Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/d4iq92F.mp4
.
    • We can instead do:
```
T0: Dual Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH Auto Cast
T4: "Off"
T6: 2H Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/SGCIwm6.mp4
.
*Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration*

.
⬥ What are the differences between these two scenarios?
    • The 2H Auto is cast and thus hits at different times
    • We can alter the 2H Auto in the second scenario, whereas in the first it will be whatever your autocasted spell is
        - We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto → Freedom (e.g., <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>)

.
*Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you "off" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.*

.
> **__Switches__**
.tag:Switches
This section will detail several switches that are useful for magic, and should be incorporated as comfortable and when relevant.

.
**__Juggling__** <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> / <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ This is simply referring to either adding a Dual Wield swap or Staff swap depending on if you currently Staff camp or Dual Wield Camp.

.
⬥ This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Conc Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> or Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> respectively.
    • Thus, it gives you a new filler ability to make use of and so you can manage cooldowns more effective and also increase your average damage overall.
    • Moreover, it gives you all the benefits that Staff camping and Dual Wield camping alone provides.

.
⬥ This is a good stepping stone for those that wish to move away from weapon camping but are not confident enough, or simply to not desire, to 4-tick auto attack (4TAA).

.
**__Guthix Staff__** <:gstaff:513203008608141314>
⬥ This is a basic switch to incorporate into rotations, and is beneficial to do so where possible.
    • This is generally speaking bosses where you require the affinity debuff or if you have excess adrenaline to dump.

.
⬥ The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack.

.
⬥ There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows:
    • It is benficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack.
        - This brings the adrenline cost from 25% to 22.5%.
    • If you have Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> stacks.

.
⬥ 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> to Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314>, which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> in the same tick.
    • This works because the game only checks if Aftershock is on at the end of a tick.
    • Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: <:gstaff:513203008608141314> → <:spec:537340400273195028> → Weapon B

.
⬥ If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability).
    • Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> → equip Weapon B
        - If you do not wish to 0-tick your spec, then you do not need to do the weapon swap at the end on the same tick.

.
**__Planted Feet__** <:pf:689501925770919981>
⬥ This is a very strong switch that requires minimal effort to incorporate.

.
⬥ This perk increases the duration of Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT).
    • It makes Sunshine's <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0→51) to 64t/38.4s total (t0→t63).

.
⬥ Generally speaking you always want to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> with your Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch.

.
⬥ Typically this perk will go on a defender so that you do not need to bring both a shield and planted feet when a shield is required for Resonance or building adrenaline only
    • This perk can also be seen put on Wands
    • Further, in rare instances, this perk can also be seen put on an Enhanced Excalibur for content that requires both a shield and planted feet switch where saving any inventory space is important.

.
**__Flanking__** <:flank4:712073088296157185>
⬥ This is a simple, yet strongly recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing group-based content.

.
⬥ This turns Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> and Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant
    • It increases Minimum of Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> by 8% per Flanking rank and its Max by 40% per Flanking rank
    • It increases Minimum of Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> by 6% per Flanking rank and its Max by 30% per Flanking rank

.
⬥ It is recommended to put this perk on an off-hand switch
    • Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Praesul Wand <:praeswand:643166769518739477> + Virtus Book <:vbook:656785078160195615> > <:cywirwand:643161591571021824> + Imperium Core <:impercore:643166751067996160>)
    • Due to the fact that if you swap main-hands you lose the crit buff of Concentrated Blast

.
**__Dragonrider Amulet__** <:drider:656785090994503700>
⬥ This is a more advanced switch thats usefulness goes down as the necklace you primarily wear gets better.
    • Unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, in the current state of the game even with an Essence of Finality (or) <:eofor:745279787471470713> equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch.

.
⬥ This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • It boosts its damage by 10%
    • It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's <:dbreath:535533833391702017> max hit rounded down per hit
        - This excludes boosts that do not normally boost bleeds

.
**__Seren Godbow__** <:sgb:626466665848242186>
⬥ This is an advanced switch to incorporate into rotations, though it is highly beneficial to do so where it is worth it.
    • this is generally speaking bosses that are 5x5 in size or larger.

.
⬥ The main purpose of incorporating this switch is to make use of its special attack.

.
⬥ There are a few considerations to list, and they are as follows:
    • You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) <:ingen:641339234111848463> to ensure the special attack does not splash.
        - If you do not, depending on the content done, you may have to remove several pieces of armor to reduce the odds of splashing.
    • It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack.
        - This brings the adrenaline cost from 30% to 27%.
    • It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish <:anguish:583429936665198592> or Desolation <:Desolation:513190159018098713>.
        - This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen <:ingen:641339234111848463>, but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario.

.
⬥ If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability)
    • This is worth noting as it is a heavy input sequence to execute in a single tick:
<:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:vigour:615613235512737792> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → <:anguish:583429936665198592>/<:Desolation:513190159018098713> → <:ingen:641339234111848463> → <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> is first and the Special <:spec:537340400273195028> is last.

.tag:4TAA
**__What it is__**
⬥ 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA), is an extension of weapon juggling wherein, as the name implies, you force an auto attack on the 4th tick after casting the ability before

.
⬥ As mentioned earlier, when you cast a damaging ability it will put your autos on cooldown
    • 4t cooldown after a fastest speed (wand) ability, 6t after an average speed (staff) ability

.
⬥ So to 4TAA, we make use of this fact, along with the fact that Magic can force an auto + ability on the same tick due to having access to spell (and thus auto) binds
    • We make use of this by delaying our next ability by a tick to force an auto and ability on the 4th tick

.
**__How it Works__**
⬥ The general 4TAA structure without Greater Concenterated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> will be like:
```
Auto + 2H/DW Ability → non-channeled DW Ability → (if DW Ability w/ Auto) Staff Swap → Repeat
```
⬥ The general 4TAA structure with gConc <:gconc:869285393223254107> will be:
```
Auto + 2H/DW Ability → gConc → non-channeled DW Ability → (if DW Ability w/ Auto) Staff Swap → Repeat

OR

Auto + gConc  → DW Ability → non-channeled DW Ability → Staff Swap → Repeat
```
⬥ The difference between having <:gconc:869285393223254107> and not having <:gconc:869285393223254107> are as follows:
    • Instead of generally autoing every 7 ticks, it is every 10 ticks
    • Ensuring that you maximize <:gconc:869285393223254107> casts by using it every 3rd ability
        - Additonally <:gconc:869285393223254107> is always followed by a dual-wield ability, this is because swapping mainhands loses the <:gconc:869285393223254107> crit buff
    • When you want to use Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (which ideally is 2-hit) it is the ability before <:gconc:869285393223254107>

.
⬥ As you can see, when not using <:gconc:869285393223254107>, the auto is forced every other ability. This is simply due to the fact that 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only cast it after every other ability

.
⬥ Further, you can see the ability before it repeats (i.e., before you do your next auto + ability) has to be a non-channeled Dw ability
    • It *must* be a dw ability due to the 4t auto cooldown associated with it, allowing you to do a 2H auto 4t later
    • It *must* be non-channeled because each hit of a channel resets your auto cooldown
        - Thus it is generally ideal to always do an auto into your channeled ability, or at the very least do not do a channel before you intend to auto

.
⬥ Moreover, you can see that after an auto you can do either a 2H or DW ability, this is because it does not particularly matter assuming same perking and tiers
    • That being said, you *must* (outside of very niche cases without <:gconc:869285393223254107>) always ensure that when you do an auto into a channeled, that the channeled ability is done with DW (this is mostly important for Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, as Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> is already DW locked, and Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372> is not relevant)
        - This is because of the fact that when the channeled hits it incurs your auto cd, it is going to incurs it based off the weapon you are wearing, thus if you staff <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, when your <:asphyx:535533833072672778> ends your auto is on a 6t cooldown again
        - The table below will showcase two different scenarios:
```
2H Asphyxiate:

You MUST do:
Auto + Asphyxiate → Ability → DW Ability → Auto + Ability

DW Asphyxiate:

You can do:
Auto + Asphyxiate → DW Ability → Auto + Ability
```
*Note: this is not an issue if you do auto + abil → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → non-channeled dw ability → repeat structure, given the fact you are already planning to auto 2 abilities after <:asphyx:535533833072672778>*

https://youtu.be/HmZR1BBwsK0

.
**__Text Based Guide__**
⬥ The basic principles is you can do lossless spellcasting by hitting a spell from actionbar (lossless meaning you don't lose ticks performing the action)
    • This lets you auto the same tick as you use an ability (input is auto → abil)

.
⬥ When you can autoattack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: <:praeswand:643166769518739477> = 4t and <:noxstaff:513190159294922753> = 6t

.
⬥  Your delay after an action is given by max(currentdelay, delay from action)
    • Implications from this are that if you do a wand ability you'll be able to autoattack 4 ticks after. If you do a staff ability, you will be able to autoattack 7 ticks after.

.
**__A Simple Step-by-Step Practice Rotation on How to 4 Tick Auto Attack__**
⬥ Things you need:
    • Wand + Orb <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
    • Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>
    • Runes <:Airrune:536252658986647589>
    • An ability bar with the basic abilities:
        - Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136>
        - Concentration Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>
        - Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
        - Auto Attack (such as <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>)
*Note: <:wrack:856662355952795658> is being used for practice solely due to its short cooldown, in actual PvM you should almost never be using this ability*

.
⬥ **Step 1**:
    • Equip Wand + Orb <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>, acquire a target, and Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>

.
⬥ **Step 2**:
    • Equip Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>
    • Press Auto Attack + Sonic (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:sonic:535533809924571136>) in the listed order on the same tick

.
⬥ **Step 3**:
    • Equip Wand + Orb and Wrack (<:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> → <:wrack:856662355952795658>)

.
⬥ Steps 2-3 demonstrated:

⬥ **Step 4**:
    • Equip Staff, wait 1 tick after gcd and press Auto attack → Equip Wand + Orb → Concentrated Blast (<:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> + <:conc:535533833106489365>)

.
⬥ **Step 5**:
    • Use Wrack with Wand + Orb still equipped (<:wrack:856662355952795658>)

.
⬥ **Step 6**:
    • Equip Staff and wait 1 tick after gcd. Repeat steps 2-6.

**__4TAA Additional Info__**
⬥ **Note that this is just a practice rotation**. Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658> is generally not a good basic ability to use in combat and is only utilized here due to it's very short cooldown. In real combat, replace Wrack with Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Impact <:impactflank:867678154369400862>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, etc.
⬥ When practising, set the combat dummy to 'Max Hit Mode' then take note of how much damage your Staff auto attack deals compared to a Wand auto attack. To benefit from 4TAA, you want to consistently do Staff auto attacks.
⬥ Step 4 must be done in quick succession; all inputs must be done within one tick. To make this easier on yourself try keybinding your Wand/Orb/Auto in an easy to reach set of keystrokes.
⬥ This guide only covers the basic pattern of 4TAA. Once you're confident in performing steps 1-6, try to mix and match other basic abilities to create your own 4TAA rotation.
⬥ You will know you did not lose any ticks between auto and abilities if you do not see the auto firing animation, but the auto itself still firing

.
> **__4TAA Troubleshooting__**
.tag:Aid
While practising you may be unsure if you are messing up or not, so the following clips will showcase various scenarios: too fast, correctly, and too slow

*Note: the Auto damage in all the following clips is 2515*

.
**__Too Fast__**
This means you simply did not wait the additional tick required for the auto, and so casted your ability at GCD end instead of 1 tick after GCD end to get an Auto + Ability
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/eYF30FV.mp4
.
**__Correctly__**
This means you did it correctly, this will demonstrate how it looks like in both Normals and Ancients Spellbooks
⬥ If you did not mess up on Normals, you will not get the Auto casting animation and you will see the auto still be fired out.

⬥ If you did not mess up on Ancients, you will not get the Auto casting animation.
    • As you can also see, the Auto and Ability are cast as the GCD bar flashes
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7NnF9f6.mp4
.
**__Too Slow__**
This means you were too late to cast your auto + ability, typically this results in a 5TAA (auto cast on tick 4, ability cast on tick 5), or worse (ability cast far later).

More specifically, it means your ability will be delayed as your auto will automatically fire on the 4th tick either way, assuming you did not off
