In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics.

This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritisation, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

> __**Ability Prioritisation**__
.tag:priority
__**Ability Ranking**__
⬥ **Generally, high damaging abilities should be prioritised and used more often than low damaging abilities**.
    • **This can be affected by what equipment the player owns**, such as Kerapac's wrist wraps <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940> (makes Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> stronger) or a Fractured Staff of Armadyl <:fsoa:869284271595069451> (Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> is very strong under it's special attack) and so when upgrading gear, it's worth spending a little time to understand how it impacts your abilities.
.
⬥ The following image shows the relative strengths of abilities in different scenarios, ranked by *damage per tick*.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/TJuZCUO.png
.
*Note: This is **not** an ability rotation, only a damage comparison chart. It does not consider ability cooldowns or any specific PvM encounter, simply damage-per-tick in a vacuum. For information on how to incorporate these into a proper rotation, see the __**Building A Magic Rotation**__ section below or in the pinned links.*

.
> **__Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__**
.tag:camping
*Note: This compares strictly camping dual-wield vs. camping 2H, but it is recommended to juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits and more.*
.
**__Dual Wield Camp Benefits__** <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ Access to Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • This is one of the strongest basics and can be used every 3 abilities.
    • It also synergizes much better with the City of Senntisten spells <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> <:incitefear:856635090783567902> compared to Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136>.
    • It is so strong that camping dual-wields, even several weapon tiers lower, can be significantly stronger than camping 2H.
⬥ Easier to use switches.
    • Can use <:merciless:583430258829688854> or off-hand switches like Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> easier, as no extra main-hand switch is required.

.
**__Staff Camp Benefits__** <:soa:869284271595069451>
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, which are much stronger than dual-wield autos.
    • When 2H camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>.
⬥ Can be more revolution-friendly, such as for Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857> tasks or AFK grinding methods.

.
> **__Building a Magic Rotation__**
.tag:rotation
Here we'll cover some of the points to keep in mind to build a strong Magic DPS rotation. **For more information on how these rotations are affected by certain items or switches, such as see the __Important Items__ section**.

*Note 1: In the current meta, camping dual-wield > camping 2H, although ideally we use both.*
*Note 2: If Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is not unlocked, use the regular version <:conc:535533833106489365> below.*

.
__**Managing Cooldowns**__
⬥ **High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns** - when building a rotation, ability prioritisations *and* cooldowns should be on your mind.
⬥ If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, their cooldowns will force you to use multiple weak abilities in succession while waiting to use them again.
⬥ To avoid this problem, you want to **use filler abilities to space out your high damage abilities**, to pace yourself and manage cooldowns.
⬥ **The primary magic filler abilities are Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and (Greater) Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365>**
    • Both have decent damage (157% maximum damage) **and** short cooldowns (9t/5.4s or 3 GCDs)
    • *They do not share cooldowns* - if using 2H/DW switches, you can use both.

.
__**Basic Pattern**__
⬥ **Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> should form the foundation of your rotation**. Aside from being the ideal filler ability, it also provides a crit chance buff that helps boost the following ability.
.
⬥ **The basic pattern uses <:gconc:869285393223254107> often, in 'blocks' of 3 abilities**:
    • [<:gconc:869285393223254107> → Ability → Ability ] → Repeat
⬥ **If camping 2H, replace it with Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> instead**:
    • [<:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Ability ] → Repeat
.
⬥ When building adrenaline, fill the empty slots with strong basics like the following, prioritising those that can crit:
    • Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>
    • Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • Impact (Flanking) <:impactflank:867678154369400862>
    • Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658> - hits for boosted damage on any stunned/bound target.
    • Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>
    • Combust (Walked) <:comb:535533833098100745>
    • Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> - if weapon switching.
*Note: <:comb:535533833098100745> and <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> cannot crit but are still strong abilities.*

⬥ Once your rotation gets going, you can start using abilities like thresholds or better to fill in the blanks.

.
__**Building The Rotation**__
*Note: It is assumed that Sunshine lasts for 38.4 seconds. You can do this with using Planted Feet <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> or by unlocking Greater Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> - both alternatives work. Examples of full Sunshine rotations can be found at the bottom of this guide in the __**General Sun Rotations**__ section.*
.
⬥ Sunshine <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> lasts 38.4 seconds, but only has a 60 second cooldown. **We want to prioritise building to 100% adrenaline and using Sunshine often, as it boosts damage by 50%.**
    • The exception to this is when the fight would end too quickly, or mechanics occur, and you can't benefit from the full duration.
    • Ideally, enter boss fights with 100% adrenaline so you can activate it immediately at the start.
.
⬥ **You can think of your overall rotation as two repeating sections**:
    • [38.4s inside <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> ] → [21.6s outside]  → Repeat
.
⬥ Both in and out of Sunshine <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927>, you will want to prioritise your strong thresholds, special attacks, and modified ultimates.
    • Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>
    • Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • Detonate <:detoboots:602581956072439828> <:deto:535533833358016512>
    • Deep Impact (Flanking) <:deepimpactflank:867678153611018261>
    • Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • Igneous Omnipower <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200>
    • etc.
.
⬥ The goal is to fit as many of these strong abilities within the duration of <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> as you can to maximise the damage potential.
    • **You spend the majority of time inside <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> - take full advantage of this.**
    • Continue using the basic 3-ability pattern to space your cooldowns.
⬥ **While waiting for <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> cooldown, you can use a few more thresholds/etc.**
    • You do not want to needlessly camp 100% adrenaline.
    • You can start building to 100% adrenaline when <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> is nearly ready to use again.
.
*Note: To see examples of how to maximise your damage inside <:sunshinepf:994921595489488927> see the section at the bottom called __**General Sun Rotations**__.*

.
__**Tips**__
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> is considered a weak ability and should be avoided when possible. Sometimes you may be forced to use them. Don't sweat it too much.
    • Wrack <:wrack:856662355952795658>
    • Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>
    • Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>
    • Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>
    • Impact (no Flank) <:impact:535533809655873556>
⬥ The critical chance buff gained through <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365> is wasted if the follow-up ability cannot crit <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> / <:comb:535533833098100745> but sometimes it is unavoidable.
⬥ Juggling both DW and 2H weapons gives you access to both <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365> and <:sonic:535533809924571136> as filler abilities.
    • This may provide you with more flexibility when improvising rotations.
    • However, do not delay using <:gconc:869285393223254107> if it is unlocked, <:sonic:535533809924571136> is lower priority.
⬥ If using Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>, Wrack and Ruin <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> is a good basic if the alternative is weaker than Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • This means Blood Tithe stacks are saved to buff strong basics like <:gconc:869285393223254107> or <:dbreath:535533833391702017> but weak abilities are still avoided using <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256>.

> __**What Spells to Use **__ <:Magic:689504724159823906>
.tag:whatspell
*Note: These are just general guidelines, not rules set in stone.*
.
Magic spells can be set to *autocast*, which essentially 'selects' them to use with your abilities. Think of this like picking your ammo for a ranged weapon. When using abilities, stronger spells can increase your ability damage, similar to ranged ammo. If you don't press an ability, then the selected spell gets used to cast auto attacks.

__**Important Notes**__:
⬥ All spells have a damage limit they can scale up to. For example, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is unlocked at level 81, but scales up to level 99, with the damage being capped by your weapon tier.
⬥ This is important, because **your autocast must scale *at least* up to your weapon tier**.
    • e.g. You should not autocast Air Strike <:airstrike:895600427930910730> with a Noxious Staff <:noxstaff:513190159294922753> because it stops scaling at level 16, but the staff has a requirement of level 90.
⬥ **The element of a spell generally does not affect its damage, but it can affect hitchance** if a monster is weak to that element.
    • e.g. <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> and <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> would do the same *damage* to a target weak to Air spells.
    • However, if you are not at 100% *hitchance* on a target, then using the correct weakness will increase it.
    • Some exceptions exist, such as Ice Strykewyrms <:icestrykewyrm:1004107267915907166> / Glacors <:glacor:1004107344935923743> taking boosted damage from Fire spells <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> spells.
⬥ **Some spells like <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> or <:incitefear:856635090783567902> will only give their passive benefits if selected as autocast**.

.
__**What Autocast to Use**__
⬥ To autocast a spell, right-click it in your spellbook and select 'autocast'.
⬥ Generally you should be autocasting Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258>.
    • If you plan to use Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> then *switch* to Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> until 5 stacks, then switch back.
    • If using an FSOA <:fsoa:869284271595069451> then using Blood spells <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> to autocast for healing may be useful.
⬥ If the City of Senntisten quest is not completed, use Blood Blitz/Barrage <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938>/ <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>
    • Aim to finish this quest ASAP.
⬥ If on the standard/normal spellbook, use Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> (cheapest Surge spell).
    • Use the highest rank of air spell available if <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is not yet unlocked.

.
__**What Auto to Use**__
.
⬥ It is possible to autocast one spell but use another spell to cast magic autos, such as with 4-tick Auto Attacks (4TAA) or defensive autos. Use `!defauto` and `!4taa` to learn more, or see the __**4TAA**__ section linked in the pins.
⬥ Weaker variants of spells like Blood Burst <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> vs. Blood Barrage <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> can be used to auto without losing damage if manual spellcasting is enabled.  Use `!manualspellcasting` to learn more.
    • This is usually done to save runes.
.
⬥ To select a spell for manual/defensive autos, drag it from your spellbook onto your ability bar.
.
⬥ Typically use **Blood spells for healing**:
    • Barrage/Burst <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> / <:bloodburst:841419289714098246> if AoE or faster hit timings matter.
    • Blitz/Rush <:bloodblitz:535616247807868938> / <:bloodrush:839903691329896479> otherwise.
        - Can use Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> instead if healing does not matter.
.
⬥ Use **Ice spells for freeze effects**:
    • Use Barrage/Burst <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> / <:iceburst:841419289797197824> if AoE or faster hit timings matter.
    • Blitz/Rush <:iceblitz:535613865912696883> / <:icerush:839903691234607136> otherwise.
*Note that <:iceburst:841419289797197824> and <:icerush:839903691234607136> have shorter freeze durations than their higher level equivalents*.
.
⬥ If on the Standard spellbook, use Air Strike/Surge <:airstrike:895600427930910730> / <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>.

.
**__Debuff Spells to Use__**
⬥ You should always have Vulnerability <:Vuln:537349530551582720> and Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> applied wherever bosses are not immune to the effects.
⬥ It is preferred to use Vulnerability bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> instead of the spell as they are lossless.
    • Cost of bombs is minor compared to the earnings from mid-tier or higher bosses.
⬥ Bosses immune to these effects:
    • Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082> except on phase 5/10/11
    • Araxxor / Araxxi <:Araxxi:513213019543699466> except on phase 4
    • Rise of the Six <:karil:641696573272621086>
    • Sinister Fragments at Ambassador <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>
⬥ Use Entangle <:ent:567727987274022924> if you need a long bind while on the Standard spellbook.

.
> __**Cancelling Channels**__
.tag:cancel
__**Why Channelled Abilities are Important**__
⬥ It is important to properly cancel abilities in order to not lose any ticks, or damage potential.
    • Animations can be unreliable, and longer than the actual hit duration of the ability.
    • It can be higher damage-per-tick, or net you more adrenaline, to cancel long channels early.
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> suffers a 1t delay when revolution is enabled.
        -  See the following example.
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/9C2JEZQ.mp4

.
__**When to Cancel Channels**__
*Reminder: 1.8s = 3t = 1 GCD*
⬥ **Concentrated Blast** <:conc:535533833106489365>
    • Cancel after its 2nd hit as global cooldown ends (3t/1.8s).
⬥ **Greater Concentrated Blast** <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • If revo/revo++ is on, Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> should be "cancelled" as global cooldown ends (3t/1.8s).
⬥ **Asphyxiate** <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
    • Usually cancelled after the 2nd hit as global cooldown ends (3t/1.8s), or the 4th hit (7t/4.2s).
    • 2-hit can net higher damage-per-tick, or higher adren gain, when compared to 4-hit.
    • <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> is still a strong option, especially if not using 4TAA.
    • To cancel on the 3rd hit you would cancel after 5t/3s.
⬥ **Smoke Tendrils** <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>
    • Same as Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> timing, but typically only cancelled after 4 hits.
⬥ **Armadyl Battlestaff** <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184>
    • Generally used for its full duration of 5t/3s.

> __**Important Magic Abilities**__
.tag:importantabil
Certain Magic abilities are worth noting in particular, due to their behaviour and how they can be used. Here, we cover some of these abilities.

.
> __**Greater Concentrated Blast**__ <:gconc:869285393223254107>
*Note: For a brief summary, use `!dwmagic` and `!gconc`.*
.tag:gconc
__**How It Works**__
⬥ Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is an upgraded version of regular Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, unlocked by reading a Greater Concentrated Blast ability codex <:gconccodex:869284396111364126> costing <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Unlocks!B17$.
⬥ It remains a channelled ability, but it has increased damage, and **all 3 hits can be used within 3t/1.8s, or 1 global cooldown**.

.
__**Why It's Good**__
⬥ **It makes dual-wield camping much stronger than 2H camping**.
    • A lower tier dual-wield like Cywirs <:cywirwand:643161591571021824> <:cywirorb:643161591210049556> can outperform a hypothetical T99 staff.
⬥ It hits multiple times rapidly, and has a short cooldown.
    • This gives it **good synergy with spells like Exsanguinate <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> and Incite Fear** <:incitefear:856635090783567902>.
    • It is also good for building adrenaline under an FSOA special attack <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> as the second and third hits of the ability, as well as the following ability, all benefit from increasingly bigger crit chance buffs.

.
> __**Detonate**__
.tag:deto
__**How It Works**__
⬥ Pressing Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> once begins to charge the ability, pressing <:deto:535533833358016512> a second time releases it, dealing AoE damage.
⬥ It takes 6t/3.6s to reach 100%, but wearing Blast Diffusion Boots <:detoboots:602581956072439828> reduces this time to 4t/2.4s.
⬥ The radius depends on how the far it's been charged:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/W7hGdr0.png
⬥ **Detonate is centred based on the target's NPC coordinate**, similar to normal AoEs.
    • For NPCs bigger than 2x2, this is their always their SW tile.
⬥ **Detonate is centred differently with and without a target**:
    • If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> without a target, it is centred on your player.
    • If you cast <:deto:535533833358016512> with a target, it is centred on that target's coordinate.
⬥ If a selected target dies while detonate is still being cast:
    • If you target cycle to another target, the detonate will remain centred on the original (dead) target's coordinate.
    • If you do not target cycle, the centre will be shifted to your player coordinate.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/NhmICrb.png
*Note: The detonate on the left will only hit the south dragon, but on the right it will hit both. For more on NPC centres and coordinates, as well as other related information, check out <#1020050319457132654>.*

.
**__What Makes Detonate Unique__**
*Note: Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is used to signify any magic auto spell in general.*
.
⬥ Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> is technically not a channel, however, it is often considered one due to its unique charge-and-release mechanism.
⬥ Unlike other channels, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> acts similar to a defensive in the context of defensive autos.
    • Auto cooldown is not incurred until its release, meaning you can release it with an auto.
        - Example: charge <:deto:535533833358016512> → auto + (release) <:deto:535533833358016512>
⬥ **Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> is typically released with both an auto and the next ability at the same time, to maximise damage.**
    • Example: <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t/1.8s) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037>
        - The hit timing and input order here are crucial: <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:wm:535533809978966037> must be executed in exactly that order, on the same tick.
.
⬥ You can do the following while charging <:deto:535533833358016512>, *without interrupting the ability*:
    • Switch weapons <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:Core:625304432581672961>
    • Throw bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> <:stickybomb:655341074306301964>
    • Spellbook swap <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154>
    • Shield Dome <:sd:537341954392850442>
        - This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by drinking a potion or eating food to cancel <:shielddome:537341954392850442> before releasing detonate.
⬥ You can stall the release of <:deto:535533833358016512>.
    • Generally speaking you cannot stall channels (except melee channels <:fury:535532879510372352> <:assault:535532855191928842> <:destroy:535532879330148352> <:gflurry:535532879283879977> where you can stall 1 hit of the channel).
⬥ Detonate is not affected by Channeler's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914>.

.
__**Known Issues with Detonate**__
⬥ Sometimes, Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15%.
    • This can be explained as follows: the game thinks you both have and don't have a target at the same time, so it uses adrenaline from both your target and the adrenaline inherently used from using it without a target
    • To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>.
⬥ Casting Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> on the same tick your target dies will cancel the charge completely.

> __**Greater Chain**__ <:gchain:787904334495088672>
*Note: For a brief summary, use `!gchain`*.
.tag:gchain
__**How It Works**__
⬥ Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> is an upgraded version of regular Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>, unlocked by reading a Greater Chain ability codex <:gchaincodex:1004453786384875621> costing <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Unlocks!B15$.
⬥ It hits the target, as well 2 additional targets within a 6 tile radius. **These targets then taken 50% damage from the next ability used on the main target**.
    • With Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336>, the number of additional targets hit with <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> can be increased up to 6.
⬥ If the main target dies, the AoE effect will be lost.

.
__**Why It's Good**__
⬥ It provides **excellent opportunity for AoE damage**.
    • e.g. using a powerful ability on the main target like Igneous Omnipower <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200> after <:gchain:787904334495088672>, or with high hitting special attacks such as <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028>.
⬥ Using damage-over-time abilities like Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> and Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> will apply their full damage to all targets, rather than only 50%.
⬥ There is a **known bug where it can apply to multiple abilities**:
    • By using <:gchain:787904334495088672> → (optional <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028>) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → (4t) Ability, all the 2-3 attacks will become AoE.
⬥ It can be used to briefly stun multiple targets with stun abilities such as <:impact:535533809655873556> and <:deep:535533833139912724> , however Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> will not stun secondary targets.
⬥ Effects of Debilitate <:debil:535541278264393729> will apply to all targets.

__**Notes**__
⬥ AoE effect does not apply to the following abilities:
    • Magma Tempest <:magmatempest:902209626509025290>
    • Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>

.
> __**Greater Sunshine**__ <:gsunshine:994644352871714836>
.tag:gsun
__**How It Works**__
⬥ Greater Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> is an upgraded version of regular Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070>, unlocked by reading a Greater Sunshine ability codex <:gsunshinecodex:1004453784539373688> costing <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Unlocks!B21$.
⬥ It **increases the duration from 52t/31.2s to 65t/39s**, and **retains the damage-over-time effect** that regular Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> has.
    • This effect may be replicated using the Planted Feet perk <:pf:689501925770919981> however this loses the damage-over-time component.

.
__**Why It's Good**__
⬥ It removes the need for a <:pf:689501925770919981> switch, potentially freeing up one inventory slot or making certain perks like Caroming 4 Planted Feet <:caroming4:791281588792590336> <:pf:689501925770919981> no longer needing to be combo'd.
⬥ The damage-over-time component can deal a moderate amount of damage, but it can also trigger other on-hit effects such as weapon poison <:weppoison:689525476158472288> <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812> making it stronger than it appears.

.
> __**Important Items**__
.tag:importantitems
This section will examine equipment that is useful for Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906>, and should be incorporated where relevant as you get comfortable with handling them. Not all items are applicable in all scenarios, so use your best judgement.

__**Guthix/Zamorak Staff Switch**__ <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651>
.tag:gstaffswitch
__**How It Works**__
⬥ These are amongst the first upgrades that Magic users should get. **This switch is used for its special attack.**
    • The special attacks are a good way to dump adrenaline for damage.
    • The <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> increases affinity by +2 for 1 minute → this is a great way to effectively increase hitchance.
    • The <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:spec:537340400273195028> lowers the target's magic level by 5% (of the previous value) and lowers its accuracy by 5% for 1 minute.
⬥ **When an Essence of Finality <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> is acquired, <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> should be placed into it immediately**.
.
⬥ If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> into this special attack as it is a Staff weapon with Average speed.

.
> __**Planted Feet Switch**__ <:pf:689501925770919981>
.tag:pf
__**How It Works**__
*Note: If you own Greater Sunshine <:gsunshine:994644352871714836> this switch is not required*.
⬥ This is a very strong, very low effort switch that increases the duration of Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> at the cost of its damage-over-time component. **It is one of the strongest switches you can have, assuming you do not have Greater Sunshine.**
    • Sunshine's <:sunshine:994921119381463070> duration is extended from 52t/31.2s total (t0→51) to 64t/38.4s total (t0→t63).
⬥ Generally, always Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> with your Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch, except when the encounter would end in 30 seconds or less.
.
⬥ Common choices for the switch include defenders <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> and the Enhanced Excalibur <:excal:641337999170207763>
    • Placing <:pf:689501925770919981> on <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> can potentially save one inventory space, as it doubles up both as a shield <:merciless:583430258829688854> and a <:pf:689501925770919981> switch.
    • Placing <:pf:689501925770919981> on  <:excal:641337999170207763> could also save an inventory space wherever you would normally bring it.
        - Many bosses do not require a shield at all, in which case <:excal:641337999170207763> can save *another* extra inventory space.
        - It also means you can use the same switch for both Ranged <:Ranged:689504724403486920> and Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906>
        - Placing it on <:excal:641337999170207763> makes it slightly more involved to use, as you have to click on the floor to not be dragged into melee distance.
    • You can also put it on a cheap wand like <:abyssalwand:841409588590805043> <:crystalwand:925794592849281094> <:attunedcrystalwand:925794593067401277>, though this is not generally recommended for the above reasons.

.
> __**Flanking Switch**__ <:flank4:712073088296157185>
.tag:flanking
__**How It Works**__
*Note: To learn more about how flanking angles work, check out <#1020050319457132654>.*
⬥ This is a **simple, easy-to-get, relatively inexpensive and strong switch, especially for group-based content**.
⬥ When standing 'behind' bosses, <:flank4:712073088296157185> turns Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> and Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun. At it's maximum rank of Flanking 4:
    • The damage range of <:impactflank:867678154369400862> is increased from 20-100% up to 52-260%, making it one of the strongest basics.
    • The damage range of <:deepimpactflank:867678153611018261> is increased from 40-200% up to 64-320%, making it much stronger.
*Note: (Flanking) Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> is still not heavily prioritised due to the availability of stronger thresholds, however it can help salvage a rotation in a pinch.*

.
> __**Caroming Switch**__ <:caroming4:791281588792590336>
.tag:caroming
__**How It Works**__
*Note: see the section on **Greater Chain** above for more information.*
⬥ This is a more niche switch, but where applicable (multiway-combat scenarios) it can be highly effective.
⬥ Per rank, this perk makes Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672> and Chain <:chain:535533833056026624> hit one additional target.
    • **With Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336> this means a total of 6 targets** hit.
    • This mostly benefits Greater Chain <:gchain:787904334495088672>, but is still bonus damage with <:chain:535533833056026624>.
    • A combination of <:gchaincaroming:867678153882861568> and strong abilities like Igneous Omnipower <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200> can give excellent AoE clear.
⬥ T**he Caroming <:caroming4:791281588792590336> switch only needs to be equipped when casting <:chain:535533833056026624> / <:gchain:787904334495088672> and can be removed after.**
.
⬥ It is recommended to put this perk on either an off-hand switch, or a defender <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> depending on your desired level of keybinds.
    • Using an off-hand switch like <:vbook:656785078160195615> <:cywirorb:643161591210049556> <:attunedcrystalorb:925794593050595348> can be cheaper and higher damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672>, however it will almost certainly cost an inventory space.
    • Using <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> instead will mean lower damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672> but can save an inventory space.
        - You could combine Caroming 4 and Planted Feet into one gizmo <:caroming4:791281588792590336> <:pf:689501925770919981> if you choose to use a <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781> to save more space.
        - **Lower damage on <:gchain:787904334495088672> is not a huge deal, as the damage from the follow-up ability (e.g. <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200> ) is far more significant for the AoE damage**, and you can switch back to your main weapons for that.
.
⬥ This switch is recommended for content such as:
    • Elite Dungeons <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>
    • Arch-Glacor <:archglacor:891948878583189514>
    • Tzkal-Zuk <:tzkalzuk:931175752651653121>
    • AoD <:aod:580167371365548042>
    • Slayer <:slayer:797896049548066857>
        - For slayer consider <:caroming4:791281588792590336> on a *staff*, as typically 2H AFK revo++ bars are recommended for slayer-type AFK content.

.
> __**Sliver Enchantments**__
.tag:sliver
__**How It Works**__
⬥ With the release of Zamorak <:zamorak:994914159969976440> and ED4, *slivers* were added to the game.
⬥ Slivers can be consumed with some other items to create *enchantments*.
    • **Enchantments are one-off consumables that permanently unlock certain effects**.
⬥ There are 3 enchantments relevant to Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906>:
    • **Enchantment of Affliction** <:enchantmentofaffliction:1006481321087991819>, costing <:coins:698816156961603654> $data_pvme:Unlocks!B22$.
        - Increases the effect of the Inquisitor's Staff <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680> by a further 5%.

        - Channeler's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> now also grants 2.5% critical strike damage, plus 2.5% more for each channelled hit.

__**How It Works**__
*Note: If an Enchantment of Flames <:enchantmentofflames:1006481322799267951> is consumed, this boosts the effect of upgraded T90 <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940> by an additional 15%.*
.
⬥ If an enemy is not susceptible to Cinderbane gloves <:Cinderbanes:513190158355660812>, these gloves are generally the best alternative.
    • They can be used as a switch even at poisonable content, but this is relatively high effort.
.
⬥ **If equipped when casting Dragon Breath, <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, the next Combust <:comb:535533833098100745> to hit within 10t/6s will have its remaining hits instantly apply at 25% more damage**.
    • **You can cast <:dbreath:535533833391702017> and <:comb:535533833098100745> in any order, and the effect still works.**
    • Any <:comb:535533833098100745> hits will be separate hitsplats, not one big hit.
    • If <:dbreath:535533833391702017> is cast on t0, <:comb:535533833098100745> has to hit within t0-9, so the latest you can cast <:comb:535533833098100745> is t7.
.
⬥ This effect will work together with other mechanics that affect Combust:
    • You can walk a target on the same tick as casting <:comb:535533833098100745> after <:dbreath:535533833391702017> to double the damage.
    • Lunging perk <:lunge4:736522494315593759> will still increase damage.
    • Using <:comb:535533833098100745> within 10s of <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> will still grant 2 hits granted.
.
⬥ It can be upgraded from T85 to T90 Enhanced Kerapac's wrist wraps using 1000 Glacor Remnants <:glacorremnants:884739993527013376>, and a Leng Artefact <:lengartefact:884739993543782420>
⬥ If an Enchantment of Flames <:enchantmentofflames:1006481322799267951> is consumed, this boosts the effect of upgraded T90 <:kerapacswristwraps:869286640722513940> by an additional 15%.

__**How It Works**__
⬥ This switch becomes less important as you acquire more powerful amulets.
    • That said, unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, even with an Essence of Finality (or) <:eofor:745279787471470713> equipped it is still a DPS increase to use this switch.
.
⬥ This necklace gives Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> the following effects:
    • It boosts its damage by 10%.
    • <:dbreath:535533833391702017> gets a 10% chance of applying a bleed that hits 3 times, dealing 10% of Dragon Breath's <:dbreath:535533833391702017> max hit (rounded down) per hit.
        - This excludes boosts that do not normally boost bleeds.

__**How It Works**__
⬥ The FSoA's immensely powerful special attack, *Instability*, costs 50% adrenaline, has a 60 second cooldown, and has two effects:
    • An initial hit of 50%-200% ability damage.
    • **Fires an auto-attack for every critical hit on the primary target**.
        - The auto is cast on the tick the critical hit lands.
.
⬥ **Auto-attacks released by <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> can also crit**. This can cause *recursive critical hits*.
    • Recursive auto-attacks will only occur if the critical hit lands on the primary target.
        - e.g. <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> doing crits on additional targets will not generate autos.
⬥ The damage of <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> auto attacks is determined by the equipped weapon when the auto is fired.
    • 2H weapon should be preferred over dual-wields for this reason.
⬥ Fired auto-attacks will *not* interrupt channelled abilities, however they will still put traditional auto attacks on cooldown.
    • **In other words, you will generally be unable to 4TAA while <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> is active.**
.
⬥ <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> has excellent synergy with Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> due to the critical hit adrenaline gain buff.
    • This results in *incredible* adrenaline gains.
.
⬥ Where possible, generally you will overlap <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> and <:sunshine:994921119381463070> to get the most out of both abilities.

.
__**Key Considerations**__
⬥ **An effective <:fsoa:869284271595069451> rotation relies on landing critical hits with 2H equipped as often and reliably as possible.**
⬥ This makes Biting 4 <:biting4:712073087809617931>, Erethdor's Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>, and a Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> essential to success.
    • Additionally, a Kal'gerion demon familiar <:kalgpouch:921410226484301925> and Crit-i-Kal scrolls <:kalgscroll:841409588954923049> should also be used when possible.
.
⬥ **The Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> is generally considered *at best* a marginal gain for Armadyl Battlestaff <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> only.** It is not necessary or recommended at its current price.
    • It does not affect the crit chance of autos produced by channelled abilities.
    • Generally, it is considered very low priority.
    • Reaver's Ring <:reaverring:839903943018283050> is significantly better than Channeller's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> if only one is camped.
*Note: Use the `!hitchance` command to calculate to ensure your hitchance is at 100% with <:reaverring:839903943018283050>.*
.
⬥ Care should be taken to avoid equipping DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:Core:625304432581672961> after strong abilities such as <:omnipowerigneous:959089455560540200> or channels like <:asphyx:535533833072672778> / <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> to avoid firing MH autos instead of 2H autos, *even if you cast the ability with 2H*.
⬥ **Generally, Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> is the only dual-wield ability worth using under <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>**.
    • Using <:gconc:869285393223254107> → ( DW Ability + equip <:soa:869284271595069451> ) in that order, same-tick, grants the <:gconc:869285393223254107> crit buff to the ability after it, and still allows hit 3 of <:gconc:869285393223254107> and the subsequent ability to fire 2H autos if they crit.

.
__**Basic Example Rotation**__
*Note: Many variations of FSOA rotations exist, and crit RNG is involved. This is simply a starting point.*
.
⬥ The following assumptions are made:
    • Auto-cast set to Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> until at least Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304> is cast.
    • Manual spellcasting enabled, therefore <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> is simply used to 4TAA.
        - AoE autos generate adrenaline 1t late, so when using <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:tsunami:535533809995874304>, the auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> will grant 10% adrenaline if it crits.
    • Igneous Kal-Mej <:igneouskalmej:902209626408382494> unlocked.
    • Conservation of Energy relic <:conservationofenergy:697808773711921195> active.

⬥ **Once <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> is active, preferably use 2H for all abilities**.
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> can be used to build adren mid-spec, keeping in mind the limitations specified earlier.
    • Smoke Tendrils <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> will always crit each of its 4 hits, and is one of the strongest abilities under <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>
        - This means it will fire at least 4 auto-attacks and generate a lots of guaranteed adrenaline (due to Tsunami crit buff).

⬥ Sample rotation:
.
<:sunshine:994921119381463070> <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> → <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> <:tsunami:535533809995874304> → <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wm:535533809978966037> ★ → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2 hit) → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:omni:535533809664262179> ★ → (<:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> if high adren) <:smoketendrils:536257336130404372> → <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofspec:746403211908481184> → improv. → <:wm:535533809978966037> → <:asphyx:535533833072672778> (2 hit)

*Note: ★ = cast ability with DW, and then equip FSOA, in that order, on the same tick.*

.
__**Spell Swapping**__
⬥ Swapping auto-cast spells during an FSOA rotation can provide situational benefits. Swapping will generally occur after 5 Incite Fear <:incitefear:856635090783567902> stacks are achieved for Tsunami <:tsunami:535533809995874304>
    • Swapping to **Blood Barrage** <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446>, especially in AOE situations, can provide an immense amount of healing. Its fast hit timing can also mean additional auto-attacks fitting within buffs from <:sunshine:994921119381463070> , <:tsunami:535533809995874304> , or <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> itself.
    • Camping **Incite Fear** <:incitefear:856635090783567902> allows Frost Surge procs during <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>, which have a chance to crit and subsequently fire auto-attacks
    • Swapping to **Exsanguinate** <:exsanguinate:856635090745950258> allows for abilities to build stacks that can benefit any usages of <:gconc:869285393223254107> under <:soa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>
        - It may also grant more efficient access to <:wrackandruin:856662355912032256> after the <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028> is finished.

__**How It Works**__
*Note: See `!sgb` command for a list of boss sizes.*
⬥ This is an advanced switch to incorporate into rotations, but it can be beneficial to do so where applicable.
⬥ **This switch is primarily to use its special attack.**
.
⬥ Some considerations when using <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> with Magic:
    • **Off-style <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> is only used for bosses that are 5x5 in size or larger**.
    • Ingenuity of the Humans (Ingen) <:ingen:641339234111848463> is required to avoid splashing, **or** remove enough armour pieces to avoid splashing.
    • It is recommended to pray flick to Anguish <:anguish:583429936665198592> / Desolation <:Desolation:513190159018098713> for the attack to increase accuracy and damage.
.
⬥ If you 4TAA, you will generally wish to Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon similar to a 2H Staff ability).
⬥ This is a relatively difficult input sequence to execute *in a single tick*:
    • <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → <:Desolation:513190159018098713> → <:ingen:641339234111848463> → <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • The order of events does not matter so long as the auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is first and the special attack <:spec:537340400273195028> is last.

__**How It Works**__
⬥ As discussed in the *Important Items* section, a <:gstaff:513203008608141314> / <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> are one of the first upgrades Magic users get and should be placed into an EoF <:eofpurple:780401412936040478> as soon as possible.
    • The special attacks are a **good way to dump adrenaline for damage**, dealing 140%-300% ability damage.
    • The <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> increases affinity by +2 for 1 minute → this is a great way to effectively increase hitchance.
    • The <:zamorakstaff:873142795706179651> <:spec:537340400273195028> lowers the target's magic level by 5% (of the previous value) and lowers its accuracy by 5% for 1 minute.

.tag:abseof
__**How It Works**__
⬥ The special attack of the Armadyl Battlestaff (ABS) <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512>, *Tempest of Armadyl*, is a channel that lasts 5t/3s, dealing 18-90% ability damage per tick, with the Channeler's Ring <:channellerring:839903943404027914> boosting this further.
⬥ **It is exclusively used in an EoF <:armadylbattlestaff:881962727705280512> <:eofyellow:780401412902223892> during FSoA special attack <:fsoa:869284271595069451> <:spec:537340400273195028>.**
    • It is used to try and generate rapid crits, as an adrenaline dump, and once other strong thresholds have been exhausted.

.
> **__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:defauto
While colloquially referred to as 'defensive' autos, it is more accurate to call them 'non-damaging' autos, since some non-defensive abilities have similar interactions with autos. Examples include Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> , Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183> and (targeted) Magma Tempest <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284>
For a thorough explanation of how defensive autos (and auto attacks in general) work, refer to <#1020050437963010149>. Here, we will simply cover some of their uses.
.
__**Why Defensive Autos Exist**__
*Note: Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is used to signify any magic auto spell in general.*
⬥ Generally, casting any ability will put your auto-attack <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on your weapon speed.
⬥ However, **non-damaging abilities do not cause this cooldown.**
    • This means that defensive autos can be used within your main ability rotation.
⬥ Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> in particular can keybind auto attacks by dragging spells on to the ability bar. This makes for some interesting gameplay mechanics.

.
__**Common Applications**__
⬥ **Applying Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> with Sunshine** <:sunshine:994921119381463070>
    • Sunshine <:sunshine:994921119381463070> is a non-damaging ability, giving a defensive auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> with the next ability:
        - <:sunshine:994921119381463070> → <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • This is commonly used to apply Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> but can be used for other debuffs like Vuln <:Vuln:537349530551582720> or Enfeeble <:Enfeeble:567727986409734145> etc.
.
⬥ **Free auto after Magma Tempest (Targeted)** <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284>
    • The targeted version of this ability can act as a non-damaging ability, giving a defensive auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> with the next ability.
    • For this to work, **it must be targeted on the ground**, not directly on a target.
        - <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:magmatempesttarget:924741973858996284> (ground) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
.
⬥ **Defensive autos can replace weaker abilities in a DPS rotation.**
    • A defensive 2H auto can take the place of a weaker ability like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> or Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880> to do more damage.
        - e.g. <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:anti:535541306475151390> → (3t) <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
        - e.g. (DW) <:freedom:535541258240786434> → (2H swap) gives an OH auto + 2H auto.
.
⬥ **Rapidly casting autos for utility or adren-building.**
    • Spamming multiple defensives with a target selected and using dual-wield can also generate adrenaline faster, since auto-attacks provide adren if they hit a target.

__**What is 4TAA**__
⬥ 4TAA is an extension of weapon juggling.
⬥ As mentioned before, **casting damaging abilities will put your auto-attack <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on your weapon speeds**:
    • Staff abilities (average speed) place it on a 6t (3.6s) cooldown.
    • Wand/Orb abilities (fastest speed) place it on a 4t (2.4s) cooldown.
    • Magic <:Magic:689504724159823906> in particular can keybind auto attacks by dragging spells on to the ability bar.
⬥ Combining these, we get 4TAA: **delaying the next ability by one tick, to force an auto and ability together on the 4th tick.**
    • 2H autos are multiple times stronger than DW autos; for this reason, **4-tick autos are almost always 2H (staff) autos**.
⬥ The basic 4TAA structure is: non-channelled DW Ability → 2H auto + ability → continue
    • The ability before the auto **must** be DW so that a 4-tick auto cooldown is incurred.
        - If the ability was 2H, a 6-tick auto cooldown would be incurred, meaning 4TAA would not be possible.
    • The ability before the auto **must also** be non-channelled, since channels incur auto cooldown multiple times, one for each cast.
        - For example, <:gconc:869285393223254107> incurs a 4t auto cooldown 3 separate times: once on T0 (first cast), and again on T1 and T2. Therefore, forcing an auto on T4 is not going to be possible, as auto cooldown is not available until T2 + 4 = T6.

.
⬥ With Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> unlocked, it is important to ensure its usage is not delayed. This means that, generally, rotations will be structured using two types of patterns. Both patterns are built in groups of three abilities, with one <:gconc:869285393223254107> and one 2H auto per group.
    • **Method A**: 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + DW/Staff ability → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → non-channelled DW ability → Repeat
    • **Method B**: 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> + <:gconc:869285393223254107> → DW/Staff ability → non-channelled DW ability → Repeat

.
⬥ It is important to note that both patterns should be used together, rather than just always choosing one or the other.
    • Only being able to execute one method will mean your rotations are less flexible and you will lose damage as a result.

__**Method A**__
⬥ How to do it, starting with staff <:soa:869284271595069451> equipped:
    • **Step 1:** 2H auto + ability, in that order, same tick (e.g. <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136>)
    • **Step 2:** Equip DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> and <:gconc:869285393223254107>
    • **Step 3:** Cast a DW non-channelled ability (e.g. <:wrack:856662355952795658>)
    • **Step 4:** Wait one tick after global cooldown, then repeat from step 1
.
⬥ This means forcing an auto every 3 abilities, for example:
    • 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wrack:856662355952795658> → (wait 1t) → 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wrack:856662355952795658> → (wait 1t) → repeat

__**Method B**__
⬥ How to do it, starting with staff <:soa:869284271595069451> equipped:
    • **Step 1:** 2H auto + equip DW <:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160> + <:gconc:869285393223254107> in that order, same tick
    • **Step 2:** Cast an ability (preferably DW to benefit from crit buff)
    • **Step 3:** Cast a DW non-channelled ability (e.g. <:wrack:856662355952795658>)
    • **Step 4:** Wait one tick after global cooldown, then repeat from step 1

.
⬥ This is still forcing an auto every 3 abilities, for example:
    •  2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:dbreath:535533833391702017> → <:wrack:856662355952795658> → (wait 1t) → 2H <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:gconc:869285393223254107> → <:wrack:856662355952795658> → <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> → (wait 1t) → repeat

__**Notes**__
⬥ **Method A can be easier for learners** to execute as it has less actions in a single tick.
    • Again, try not to fall into the habit of only using one method. Both should be leveraged.
⬥ Differences before and after buying Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>:
    • Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> are now 3 abilities (10 ticks) apart instead of 2 abilities (7 ticks).
⬥ As described before, **the ability before the auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> *must* be a non-channelled DW ability**.
⬥ It is generally ideal to auto into your channels, or at least not channel before you plan to auto.
⬥ When using Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> or Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, use it as the ability *before* <:gconc:869285393223254107>.
.
⬥ When doing auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> into a channel, generally always prefer dual-wield channels.
    • This is because the cooldown after channel ends will be based on the weapon used.
    • This lets you 4TAA one ability after the channel ends, rather than two.
    • You can see the difference in the following rotations.
```
With, 2H Asphyxiate, you MUST do:
2H Auto + Asphyxiate → Ability → DW Ability → 2H Auto + Ability

With DW Asphyxiate, you can instead do:
2H Auto + Asphyxiate → DW Ability → 2H Auto + Ability
```
.
__**Common Mistakes and Tips**__
⬥ **Going too fast**
    • Not waiting for 1t delay after global cooldown ends will prevent the auto from being cast.
⬥ **Going too slow**
    • If you delay longer than 1t it usually results in a 5TAA, delaying the auto/ability (lost ticks).
    • This is a big DPS loss.
⬥ **When done correctly, you will see the auto attack fired with no animation**.
⬥ Use a combat dummy on max-hit mode to practice, to check if you are doing 2H autos properly.
⬥ Use proper, easy-to-reach keybinds as some steps require you to perform multiple actions in one tick.
    • e.g. ( equip Wand + equip Orb + press Ability ) in 1 tick.
⬥ You *can* click your auto attack on your bar instead of using a keybind if you prefer.
