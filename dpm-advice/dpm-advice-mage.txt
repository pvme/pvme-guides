.tag:Revo
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ 👺 is 🙀 a combat 🤼♂ mode wherein you 👆👈 can 🔫💦 toggle the game 🎮🔥 to automatically 😩 activate basic, 🌑🌑 threshold, and ➕ ultimate abilities automatically 🤖 upon 🙀 reaching 👉👉 the 👌😎 required ✅ adrenaline. 💉

.
⬥ While 🏻 we 🤓👵 do not 🤷🚫 encourage using 📤 Revo++ as 💎🅱 it 🥇 limits the 🅱 amount of control ✋ a 👀😆 player 👨💰 has 👏👏 over 😏 their 😴 own 🙆 rotation, it is low-input 👏 and 💦 low maintenance.

.
⬥ Revo++ can 💦 be desirable for afking, low-effort 👇⬇ pvm, or 💦 slayer 🍆 tasks.

.
⬥ Here is 🅱👏 an ability 👉👉 bar we 👧 recommend for ⛓ Revo++, using 📤🏻 this 🏿 bar 🍻😫 with 😍😶 0 player 🏋🏋 input 📫🚾 will 🤤 yield ~130k DPM:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/4L0aa2h.png

.
⬥ To 🎊🏼 toggle on revolution++ 🔫 and highlight how 😐 many abilities to 👁🔭 trigger 😡 with it, 💧 click 🖱 the cog icon 🔔 on 🔛 your 👉 ability bar: 🥃🥃
.img:https://i.imgur.com/Dn6UDOV.png

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
⬥ Basic 🌑😶 Revolution (commonly 🅱 referred to as simply "Revolution") 💥💥 is a ♥🅰 combat 🔫🏹 mode wherein basic 🚂🌑 abilities are 🤰😻 used 😏🎶 automatically by 😈🏳 the 🚀 game 🏀🕹 but 🍑☹ threshold 🤝 and 🏽 ultimate abilities are 😱 manually activated.

.
⬥ Newer players 💰 may ♀⛲ find 💭🔍 this 🆕👏 combat 🗡♂ mode helpful 😁🤔 starting 🤠✅ out as it 🏿💯 allows for some 👨🅱 control 😕😡 over 🙊 your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic 🌑😚 abilities.

.
⬥ Below 😫⬇ is an 💰😙 ability 👉 bar we 😩 recommend to use 👏 for revolution: 👺🔫
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ihbsrD9.png
.
    • Note that 😐🙅 the 🔛 thresholds and ultimate abilities can 💦💦 be placed in 🚪 any order ❌ as 🍑 it does 😈☝ not matter ♻ where they 🏾 are on 🔛 the 👏🦉 bar − you will 😡👋 be 😡🍆 manually activating them. 😑 

.
⬥ If 👏🏃 you 😀❓ are new to 💦 using 🏻📤 revolution, 💥👺 simply ⤵😡 let 🙆 revo use basic abilities for 🏻🔜 you.
    • Activate sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> once you reach 100% adrenaline.
        - From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>, Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724>). Repeat.

.
⬥ Following this simple ♂🔢 repeating pattern of 🏿🚀 *Build 🏭👷 to 😳😠 100% 💯💯 → Sunshine → Thresholds → Repeat*, one 😅 can expect 🤗🤗 to reach 🏾 around 150k dpm with low-medium player 🏋 input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full 🌕 Manual is 💰 a 💓🅰 combat 🗡 mode wherein all 😄💯 abilities are 🏃🚫 manually activated by the player.
    • No ❌ automatic 😢😢 inputs from 🕒👑 the 👏💦 game 🎲 means 👨 no 🙅 damaging abilities will 💍💯 be done, 😩 therefore 👏 this 👈 mode requires high 🆙 input 📫📫 from the 🍂🌎 player. ♀👨

.
⬥ The 👈🙏 benefit of 💦 this ☝👈 mode is 💦☝ that it allows for 👏 the greatest 🏅 degree of ⛄ control 👉🕹 over which 🐱🙌 abilities are used 📅🏭 in any 💦 given 👈 scenario.

.
⬥ Most high 💨 level 🔥🆙 pvmers opt to 🔃 use 👎💁 this combat mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While 🤔🤔 it 😂👏 does 👏 not ❌ matter 😡 where 🤔 you 👏 place 😻 your 💯 abilities on 🔛📱 your bar 😫 with full 👌👏 manual, you 😰 may 🗓 still find 👀 it 😝😱 helpful to 😩😔 organize your 👉🏼 bar 🍻🍻 based 😫🍞 on 🅱 basics to thresholds to 👶🔍 ultimate.
    • Refer to 👉 the 🎆😎 revolution bars 🔥😂 as 🏿 examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from revo to 💦 full 🈵 manual can 🔫 seem intimidating but all 👩💦 it 💧 takes is 😍👏 practice. 🍆🍆

.
⬥ Most players 🎮💰 start 🎮🅱 by 😈🍂 letting ❌ revolution 🔫💥 activate basics while they manually input 📫📫 thresholds and 😩👏 ultimates.
    • The next 🉐⏩ step 📈👞 would be 😳 to manually activate basic 🌑 abilities too, 😍 with 🤔 revolution 🔫🔫 still 😽📞 active ☢☢ as 👍🍑 a 😱👦 failsafe.
        - Once 🌈 you 🔥👆 feel 🤤 confident in 😤 activating basic abilities manually, try 😐😢 turning 💫 off revolution. 🔫💥

.
⬥ An 💸 exercise 🤸🤸 to 💱💦 help 🤝👍 you here 🈁 is 💦🚫 to 💦 only 👀 use 👏✊ basics for 🍆💰 a 🅰 full minute ⏰ of 💻 combat on a 🚟 combat 🏹 dummy.
    • Your 🍆 goal 😫 is to 😰 not lose any ticks between 🖕👈 basic abilities, either 😤 due 👅 to cooldowns or 🚋💰 due 👅 to not ❌❌ manually activating the next 💕☃ ability fast ♂ enough.

.
⬥ Once 😩🔂 you 🌝 get 🉐🏼 comfortable at a ☝👩 combat dummy, 😘❤ try 💪🏃 on 🔛🔛 a 👌😈 real boss 🏻👨 such as 💯🎨 GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or 😛🚻 GWD2 (Vindicta).

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation__**
.tag:Priority
**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, 😤 high ⏫ damaging abilities should be 🎮🏿 prioritized and used more 🍗 often 😵💰 than 👨 low 👇⬇ damaging abilities
    • However, 🖐🖐 there's a 😍💰 catch. 😮 High ☝⬆ damaging abilities often 💰😵 come with long 😰 cooldowns.
        - If you 😊 use 😬👏 all of the high damaging abilities at 🏠 once, 💦 you 👈🐵 will 👀💯 be 🐝 forced 😠 to 💦 wait 🙄 for 👻🅱 cooldowns before you 👈 may 📅 use them 😤💔 again 🚫 – during which 👏 time you 😩 are forced 😩 to ✂ use ⚒ low 👏🏻 damage ☠ abilities.

.
⬥ To circumvent this, 😤 the 👏 trick is 👌💦 to 💦👁 use 👏😂 'filler abilities', abilities with 👏👏 decent damage ☠☠ AND 🚟💰 short cooldowns, in-between 🌍 your 🤗👆 high 🆙🔼 damaging abilities in 👏 order to 📬 pace 🏿 your 😍 cooldowns.

.
⬥ See 🤔👁 this 🎅🗑 image 📸🖼 for 🤔🎁 an 💕 idea 🤔 of 💦👱 which 🎓 abilities should be 🐝 prioritized based 👌 on damage ☄☄ (in a vacuum):
.img:https://i.imgur.com/BFrPlAE.png
.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When ⏰ building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND 📗 cooldowns should 😀 be ♿💚 on your 👣👴 mind. 👌😏

.
⬥ Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, flank Impact <:flank4:712073088296157185> <:impact:535533809655873556>, and walked Combust <:comb:535533833098100745>.

.
⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast <:sonic:535533809924571136>/<:conc:535533833106489365> would be considered a weak ability (Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, non-flank Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, single-target Chain <:chain:535533833056026624>).
    • Generally speaking, these should 💘💘 be 🐝😨 avoided.

.
⬥ If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> or Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as often as possible in your rotation.
    • A basic pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

.
⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> and Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> as filler abilities.
    • This lets you 🏻🌲 have more breathing 🐳🐳 room in ✉ what 😡 rotations and 👏 fillers you create. 📲📲
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> → Ability → Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> → Ability → Repeat will give you strong dps.

**__Why to Cancel__**
⬥ Magic 📿 has 👏 4 💦👨 channeled abilities, but this section 📦📦 will 🍡😎 only 🤣 apply to 💧✌ 3 😩😧 as 🅰🌐 they 🏼 are 💯 more ➕😢 traditional channels

⬥ It is important to ♂⚔ properly 👨 cancel abilities in 🔥👌 order ❌📑 to 👉 not 🚫 lose any 💦🎉 ticks, as 🍑 the 🍆 animation ⛏ can 👿💦 take 🐣 longer 🍆 than 👉 the 👏🔚 actual ❗ channel takes 💜💜 to 💦🗣 fully apply 😤🤔

**__When to Cancel Channels__**
⬥ In almost all scenarios, you will cancel Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

.
⬥ Typically you will cancel your Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778> on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • To ➡💦 cancel ❌❌ on 🔛🌞 3rd 👀👀 hit you would cancel ❌ on t5 (3s)
    • To 💵 cancel on 😍 2nd hit you 😍😫 would 😎 cancel ❌ on 🏿 t3 (1.8s) ♂🤔
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Smoke Tendrils <:Smoke_Tendrils:536257336130404372>

.
⬥ For more information on cancelling, refer to <@145413546409197569>'s Video on cancelling

**__What Makes Detonate Unique__**
⬥ As mentioned, Magic has 4 channels, 3 of which were mentioned prior, this section will be dedicated to Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> due to how differently it works compared to other channels

.
⬥ Unlike most channels Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> acts like or can have the following done within it:
    • It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> with an Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> given the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is not on cooldown)
    • You can throw Vulnerability Bombs <:vulnbomb:655341074235129858> during its charge time
    • You can SBS <:SBSLunars:565726489467682816> <:SBSStandards:565726489526534154> during its charge time
    • You can ❗ Shield ⚗ Dome during 🏃🚣 its 👏👇 charge time ⌚
    • You ❤👈 can stall its 📞 release 💦💦
        - Generally 👀 speaking 👏 you 🤖 cannot ⛔ stall channels (outside 🕶⛈ of 🅱👉 melees wherein only 🕦💋 1 💭 hit is stalled)

.
⬥ Typically, when releasing Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> you will release it with an Auto and an Ability
    • An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave → Detonate (3t/1.8s) → Auto Deto Dragon Breath (<:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:sonic:535533809924571136> → <:deto:535533833358016512> (3t/1.8s) → <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> <:deto:535533833358016512> <:dbreath:535533833391702017>)
        - The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> then Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512> then Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017> on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate <:deto:535533833358016512>

> **__Dual Wield vs Staff Camp__**
.tag:DwVs2H
This 🤔😰 section 📦📦 is 💦🅱 meant 🚫 to list 🤔 the benefits of 💀 camping one ☝😣 over the 🤣👏 other 👪 though it is 🍆💦 strongly 💪💪 recommended to 😰 just 🌊🏻 juggle, as 🗻 it 👉🚀 gives 😚 access to ➡ all 👨 the 🚨👌 following benefits, and 🙏👎 more.

.
**__Staff Camp Benefits__** <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>
⬥ Access to 2H Autos <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>
    • When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos <:voke:535541259465392143> <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities
⬥ More ➕➕ Revolution-friendly
    • Due to using Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> over Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>, as Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> is not a channeled ability.

.
**__Dual Wield Camp Benefits__** <:pwand:583429876242186260> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ Easier swapping
    • You can swap to Shield <:malevkite:513190159412625411> or Flanks <:flank4:712073088296157185> more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap

.
> **__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:DefAutos
*Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as "Defensive Autos", it is more technical to say it is non-damaging abilities, and so includes Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Metamorphosis <:meta:535533811304497183>.*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Typically, when you cast an ability it put your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with
    • i.e., 🤔☝ if you 👉 cast an 🅰 average speed (staff ability) 👉 it ❔💯 will 👏 be 6t (3.6s), ❤💵 if you 😀👧 cast a 🐶🔥 fastest speed ⏩ (wand ⚡ ability) it will be 🐝🐝 4t (2.4s) 🍆

.
⬥ Non-damaging 🚫 abilities are the exception to this rule, so 💯🔫 if 🚫☝ you 👈 cast one 😱♿ it 😼😍 will not 😅 put 💁😏 your 🏻 auto on cooldown
    • This 😤🤠 has several 🔂 implications, the 👈 first 😢 applies to all 💯💯 styles, the 🌊 second 🅾🅾 is 👏 magic ✨📿 specific

.
**__Implications__**
⬥ Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage <:icebarrage:537340400185245701> or Entagle <:ent:567727987274022924>) *then* the defensive
    • The following table 😾 will break down 🏽 the 🗺💞 ticks of 🚀👯 this:
.
```
T0: Wand 💦💦 Ability 👉
T3: Defensive
T4: Auto 🤖 is 🅱👊 cast
T6: Ability
```
.img:https://i.imgur.com/YG0dSvD.mp4
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999>, as the cooldown for any Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all)
    • A 👌 further 🤔😝 consideration, is if that 🤗🙎 ability on 🔛 t6 is a non-channeled dw ability, 👉 you 💦👉 can ✈💦 4tick an 🏻 ability afterwards
        - This can be seen in the following video by <@593106625955495947>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw 🤑🤔

.
⬥ Secondly, a benefit 😩😩 magic ✨📿 has, due 👅👅 to 💰💦 it 😩👏 having auto 🤖🤖 binds, is 💦 that 🎄 you 🅱☠ can make 🖕 sure 😉✔ an 🤔🔞 auto + ability 👉 is 💦 cast on the 👏 same tick (rather 🏿 than ⬆💉 an 💸 auto 🤖🤖 is cast on 1 👱🍑 tick, and 🗣 the 👏👏 ability 👉 a tick after) 👀😩
    • This 👇 allows magic to do a 😯🎊 2H abil into 👏 a defensive auto 🤖🤖 as 🗻 a 👇 result
    • The 🔎🆕 following table 😾 will 👏 break 😲 down 😩 the ☝🌾 ticks of 💦 this: 🤠
```
T0: Staff Ability 👉
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto + Ability 👉👉
```
.img:https://i.imgur.com/HI2ebR6.mp4
.
    • For 👅🏽 Melee and Ranged this would 💀😏 result in: 🌍👏
```
T0: Average Speed ⏩ 2H Ability
T3: Defensive
T6: Auto 🤖🤖
T7: Ability
```
    • This 📣 is 💰👉 important 😍 as 🍑 it is 💦 highly beneficial to make 🖌💰 use 👏 of 🔴 this 👆⬆ when staff camping, as 🍑 it will aid in 😛🍞 preventing you ❌ using bad abilities like 🐱 Tuska's Wrath and 🍟 Sacrifice due 👅 to the lack of 💦💦 abilities at your disposal

.
⬥ It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto
    • You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - If 👏 you wanted 🌚 to change 🔁 what the 2H auto 🤖🤖 is, 📆 you 👆☝ would 🌲 have 🈶👏 to 🏼✌ 3 💦 tick it

.   
⬥ It 💯🐓 is 🤔😳 also important to 😛🚶 note 📝🅰 that if 👀👉 you 😀👈 click anything from 😂 your 👏👌 inventory, or 💀 click 🖱 the ♀👏 ground anywhere, before the auto 🤖 would 🌹👪 naturally fire 🔥🔥 then 👄🙈 you 🙂💦 must 😡 re-click your target
    • With Magic, 📿📿 hitting 😦 your ♥ auto bind yields the same 👤❗ result

.
**__Delaying Defensive Auto__**
⬥ Based 😎 off 💦😂 this 👇🌈 fact, 🔍🔍 you can make 🙋🏻 use 😂 of 🍨 this 👆🙆 if you 👉😉 need 👏 to delay a defensive auto 🤖 for whatever 👆 reason 🕵🙎
    • More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what *both* the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it
    • The following examples will be done with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>, however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast
    • For Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> specifically, we will "off" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto

.
⬥ There 👌✔ are several 💯😳 ways to "off" 🎇 to 💦✨ delay the 🔥🏥 auto, these include: 😠😠
    • Clicking under ⬇ yourself 🙄
    • Clicking a spell 💪 you 🤙 cannot ⛔👎 cast (e.g., 💉 trying to ⚠🙏 cast Disruption Shield when 😩😩 on the 😅 Ancient 🎶 Spellbook)
    • Clicking something from your inventory

.
*Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto.*

.
⬥ There 💍✔ are 🏼😩 also ➕ a 🚧 couple differences between 👈 hitting your auto 🤖 bind to cast your auto and 🚄🔬 clicking to 😰👀 cast your 🍑⬆ auto 🤖🤖 after 🏃 you "off", they 👩 are 👏💯 as follows: ♀♀
    • You cannot ⛔❌ hit 👉👊 your 👉 auto 🤖🤖 bind 👔 to 👆🎖 try 😥😐 and 🏼 recast your 👃👉 auto 🤖 mid-GCD, you 😞❤ need ✅ to 💦💦 3 tick it 😳🙌
    • If ⁉ you 🔥👈 use 👏 your 👉 auto 🤖🤖 bind 👔👔 to 💰👉 recast your auto, 🤖 you 👉👆 can 🔫🔫 alter what the auto 🤖 will 👏😜 be when you 👈👍 cast it 😐
    • You 🏾🐵 can click to recast your auto 🤖🤖 mid-GCD
    • If 👏😂 you 🎸🙂 click 🖱 to recast your 💦 auto, 🤖 your 👆 next ability must be 👨 at 😔❓ least 😴 1 tick after 👀👀 otherwise you ♀😫 will override it 😵
        - if 🔎👏 you 😀😂 click to ⏬💦 recast your 👗 auto 🤖🤖 ideally you 🅰👉 do 🏻 it 😍👌 mid-GCD so 😴 that you ♂ do 👌 not waste ☹ ticks

.
.
⬥ Thus, for Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> we can do as follows:
    • Instead of 💦☪ the ❗ normal 🖖🖖
```
T0: Dual 🏏🏏 Wield Ability 👉
T3: Freedom + OH 🐦👶 Auto Cast
T4: 2H Auto 🤖🤖 cast
T6: Ability 👉👉
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/d4iq92F.mp4
.
    • We can 😬 instead 🚔 do: 💕
```
T0: Dual 🏏 Wield Ability
T3: Freedom + OH 😅 Auto Cast
T4: "Off"
T6: 2H Auto + Ability
```
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/SGCIwm6.mp4
.
*Note: For both of these sample videos, Air Surge <:AirSurge:543465115870035999> is the auto-casted spell and Fire Surge <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> is the manually selected auto. I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration*

.
⬥ What 😲 are 🚟 the ❄☝ differences between 👎↔ these 🔫😍 two 💏💏 scenarios?
    • The 😜 2H Auto is 🐠😇 cast and ➗🎅 thus hits 🎯🎯 at 🚓👌 different times 💯🕰
    • We 👥 can 👀🗑 alter the 💞🅱 2H Auto 🤖 in 👏 the 🆘👽 second 🅱 scenario, whereas in 👇👏 the 😬🌎 first 👆 it 🔫 will 👏🍡 be 🏳🌈 whatever 🏿 your 🌼 autocasted spell 🏻💪 is
        - We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto → Freedom (e.g., <:FireSurge:543465116092334083> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>)

.
*Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you "off" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.*

.
> **__Switches__**
.tag:Switches
This 👈 section 📦 will detail several ♂ switches that ⏪ are 🤰🙅 useful for 🎄 magic, and 😍➕ should be 🐝 incorporated as 😎🍑 comfortable and 💰😖 when 😂 relevant.

.
**__Juggling__** <:inquisitorstaff:694566917553520680>/<:praeswand:643166769518739477> <:impercore:643166751067996160>
⬥ This 🎊 is 😦 simply 😡😡 referring to either adding a Dual 🔫🏏 Wield swap or 💁😩 Staff swap depending on 🔛👋 if 🅱👏 you currently Staff camp or 🚨😤 Dual 🔫🏏 Wield Camp.

.
⬥ This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Conc Blast <:conc:535533833106489365> or Sonic Wave <:sonic:535533809924571136> respectively.
    • Thus, it ❓😡 gives 😚😚 you 👨 a 👌👌 new 👶 filler ability to ♂ make 💸📝 use 👏👏 of 💦💦 and so you 👈 can manage cooldowns more effective and also 🅱 increase your 👏💦 average 😂✖ damage ☄☠ overall.
    • Moreover, it 😏🤔 gives 😚😚 you 👶😏 all the benefits that Staff camping and 😙 Dual 🏏🏏 Wield camping alone 🙃🙀 provides.

.
⬥ This 🚙 is 🖍 a 🚕🚓 good 😌 stepping stone ☄ for those 👞🐥 that 👆👌 wish to 👁 move away 😬 from 💋💰 weapon 🔫🔫 camping but 🍑👩 are not confident enough, or 💁 simply 😡 to 👌💦 not ❌🤦 desire, to 💪 4-tick auto 🤖🤖 attack (4TAA).

.
**__Guthix Staff__** <:gstaff:513203008608141314>
⬥ This ⬆ is 👏 a ☠ basic 🚂🌑 switch 🎚 to incorporate into 👏 rotations, and ✊ is beneficial to 😅🏻 do 🍆👏 so 💯 where possible. 🔝
    • This is 💦 generally 👀 speaking bosses where 👋🏿 you 👈💤 require 📜 the 🦃 affinity debuff or 💁🍆 if you 👉🤐 have 🙈💪 excess adrenaline 💉 to dump.

.
⬥ The ⏪😫 main purpose 😀💀 of 🔌💰 incorporating this ⬆🏿 switch 🎚🎚 is to make 👊 use 🎮🖐 of 👊 its special attack. ⚔

.
⬥ There ✔ are 😡🏿 a 🏻 few 😋 considerations to 🍆💦 list, 🤔❌ and 🔫👉 they ♂ are 😎 as 🍑🍑 follows:
    • It is benficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack.
        - This 😫 brings 🔙🔙 the 😫 adrenline cost 💳💰 from 👩 25% to 💦🤸 22.5%.
    • If you have Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> stacks.

.
⬥ 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> to Guthix Staff <:gstaff:513203008608141314>, which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock <:as4:712074245202772009> in the same tick.
    • This works 👷💦 because the game 💻🎳 only 🙇👏 checks ✔✔ if Aftershock is 👌 on at 🍆❓ the end 🔚 of 👉 a 👌 tick.
    • Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: <:gstaff:513203008608141314> → <:spec:537340400273195028> → Weapon B

.
⬥ If 🚀 you 💨👈 4TAA, you 😀🏃 will generally 👀 wish 🌠 to 💵✌ Auto 🤖 into 🚟 this special attack 🤼 (as 🛠🅰 it 🎈😳 is 🤔 an 🍆 Average 💰 Speed weapon, 🏹 so ❓ think of it as a Staff Ability).
    • Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:gstaff:513203008608141314> <:spec:537340400273195028> → equip Weapon B
        - If 👏👏 you do 👌 not 🚫 wish 🎁 to 💰💰 0-tick ❗ your spec, then 👣 you 👆👈 do not 🙅 need to do 🤞 the ⭐ weapon 🗡 swap at 😔 the 🍃 end 👌🔚 on 🏽🚶 the 💰🏞 same tick.

.
**__Planted Feet__** <:pf:689501925770919981>
⬥ This is 💦 a very 👿 strong 💪💪 switch 💑💑 that 🏻 requires minimal effort 👏 to incorporate.

.
⬥ This perk increases the duration of Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT).
    • It makes Sunshine's <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0→51) to 64t/38.4s total (t0→t63).

.
⬥ Generally speaking you always want to Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> with your Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch.

.
⬥ Typically this 😍 perk ⏫⏫ will 👏 go on 🔛🔛 a 😧🗣 defender so that ☃🚟 you 👈😁 do 👏💯 not 🏼 need to bring both a 👌 shield 💦 and 🗣💰 planted feet 👣👞 when 💕 a 👌 shield 💦⚗ is 😂 required ✅📋 for 🍆 Resonance or ➕💁 building adrenaline 💉 only
    • This ☝ perk ⏫⏫ can 💦 also be seen put 🎅💁 on Wands
    • Further, 💰💰 in rare ☯ instances, this 👈👈 perk can 🔫🔫 also ➕➕ be seen 🥜 put ☺ on 🅱😩 an 🦅🤗 Enhanced Excalibur for content that 👅 requires both 👩🌊 a 👌 shield 💦⚗ and planted feet switch where ☝ saving any inventory space is 😤🚋 important. 🤣✅

.
**__Flanking__** <:flank4:712073088296157185>
⬥ This is a ♥ simple, 😂🔢 yet strongly 💪 recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing 📌 group-based content. ☺

.
⬥ This turns Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> and Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant
    • It increases Minimum of Impact <:impact:535533809655873556> by (Flanking Rank * 8)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 40)%
    • It increases Minimum of Deep Impact <:deep:535533833139912724> by (Flanking Rank * 6)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 30)%

.
⬥ It 🙂 is recommended to 💦💦 put ✋ this ☝ perk ⏫ on 🔛🔛 an 👏 off-hand 😂 switch
    • Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Praesul Wand <:praeswand:643166769518739477> + Virtus Book <:vbook:656785078160195615> > <:cywirwand:643161591571021824> + Imperium Core <:impercore:643166751067996160>)
    • Due to the 🏽 fact 🛡 that 👌 if 🅱💵 you swap main-hands you lose 🚫 the 🚑👦 crit buff of 😂💦 Concentrated Blast

.
**__Dragonrider Amulet__** <:drider:656785090994503700>
⬥ This 😡😡 is a 👌🆒 more ⏫💳 advanced 📕⚛ switch 🎚 thats usefulness goes down ⬇ as 🍑👦 the 👏 necklace 💍 you 🏼 primarily wear gets better. 👍
    • Unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, in the current state of the game even with an Essence of Finality (or) <:eofor:745279787471470713> equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch.

.
⬥ This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>
    • It boosts its 👌 damage by 👏 10%
    • It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's <:dbreath:535533833391702017> max hit rounded down per hit
        - This excludes boosts that do 😊 not normally boost bleeds

.
**__Seren Godbow__** <:sgb:626466665848242186>
⬥ This 👉 is 🔥 an advanced switch 🎚 to 😤 incorporate into 🅱 rotations, though it ❌💦 is highly 🌿💨 beneficial to 🔟 do 💯 so where 🤷 it is worth 💰 it. 😠
    • this 😡 is ❤💦 generally 😄😄 speaking bosses that are 5x5 in size or 💁👱 larger.

.
⬥ The 👏👢 main purpose of 💦☝ incorporating this 😞😂 switch is 💦 to make use of its 👏 special attack. ⚔⚔

.
⬥ There ✔👌 are 💯👴 a few 📅 considerations to 😅 list, 📇 and they 👩 are as follows: ♀♀
    • You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) <:ingen:641339234111848463> to ensure the special attack does not splash.
        - If you 🅱👧 do not, 🙅🚫 depending on 🙇🔛 the 👩👀 content 😤🏗 done, 😘😅 you 😤 may 🐝 have 🙀 to 💦➡ remove several ⛓ pieces 💯🐊 of 💦 armor ⛓ to reduce the odds of splashing.
    • It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792> this special attack.
        - This 👇🖖 brings 🔙🔙 the adrenaline 💉 cost 🤤👀 from 30% ✈ to 27%.
    • It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish <:anguish:583429936665198592> or Desolation <:Desolation:513190159018098713>.
        - This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen <:ingen:641339234111848463>, but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario.

.
⬥ If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability)
    • This 👈 is 💦 worth noting as it is 👉😓 a 💰👌 heavy 🐘🍑 input 📫📫 sequence to 💦 execute in 🚪👏 a single tick:
<:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> → <:vigour:615613235512737792> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> → <:anguish:583429936665198592>/<:Desolation:513190159018098713> → <:ingen:641339234111848463> → <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto <:bloodbarrage:537338981747261446> is first and the Special <:spec:537340400273195028> is last.

.
> **__4TAA__**
.tag:4TAA
**__What it is__**
⬥ 4-tick 😘🍆 Auto 🤖🤖 Attack (4TAA), is 🤔 an extension of 😂💰 weapon juggling wherein, as 🍑 the name 😐 implies, you force ♀ an 👏👹 auto 🤖🤖 attack on the 👧 4th tick after casting the ability 👉 before 🎄

.
⬥ As 💰 mentioned earlier, when 💕💦 you 😏 cast a 🙄👌 damaging ability 👉 it will 🐼 put ☝✋ your 👱✔ autos on cooldown
    • 4t cooldown after 👀💦 a 💰👌 fastest speed ⏩ (wand) ⚡😥 ability, 👉👉 6t after an 😯 average speed ⏩⏩ (staff) ability 👉

.
⬥ So to 👵😘 4TAA, we ♀ make 🏈 use 👏 of this 👏 fact, 🔍🏫 along with the 🅱 fact 🛡👩 that 😐😐 Magic can force 😣👊 an ➕ auto 🤖🤖 + ability 👉👉 on 😢🚟 the 👥👭 same tick due 👅👅 to 💦 having 😸 access 🚪 to 💦💦 spell 💪🏻 (and 👏💰 thus 😂👌 auto) 🤖🤖 binds
    • We make ♀ use 👏🚀 of 👱💅 this 🎊 by delaying our 💩💩 next ability by a 👌😵 tick to 🏼 force an 👹 auto 🤖 and 💮💯 ability 👉 on the 👏🙏 4th tick

.
**__How it Works__**
⬥ The ✝🅿 general ♂👮 4TAA structure will 🎬 be 🐝👬 like:
```
Auto 🤖🤖 + 2H/Dw Ability 👉 → non-channeled 🏆🏆 Dw Ability 👉👉 → Repeat 🔂🔂
```

⬥ As 🍑 you 👀 can 🔫 see, the 😈 auto is 👏 forced 😠😩 every other 👪 ability, this ❤ is simply 😡😡 due to 👏😔 the 👏💰 fact that 👀 2H autos have a 6t cooldown so you can only 🔑🙌 cast it after every 💯👏 other 💰💰 ability 👉👉

.
⬥ Further, 🔙💰 you can 💦💦 see the ability before 🔙🔙 it 💯 repeats (i.e., 👏 before ⬅😳 you 👈😏 do 😽✔ your next ⏩ auto 🤖 + ability) has to ➡👏 be 👬 a 👌 non-channeled Dw ability 👉👉
    • It *must* be a 😂🅰 dw ability 👉👉 due 👅 to 😈👉 the 4t auto cooldown associated with 👏😫 it, ➡😂 allowing you to 😆💰 do 🅱🏃 a 👌😰 2H auto 🤖🤖 4t later 💯
    • It 🍆😏 *must* 😠 be non-channeled because 🍆❌ each 👏👏 hit of 💦 a channel 🤡👌 resets your 😌 auto cooldown
        - Thus 😮🕵 it is 👉👏 generally ideal to 🤧🔣 always do 🏻 an 💶👹 auto 🤖 into 🤔 your 💃 channeled ability

.
⬥ Moreover, you 🅱😍 can 💯💦 see that after an auto 🤖🤖 you 😧👈 can 🔫 do either 😗♂ a 2H or 👉 Dw ability, this ⬆⏪ is 💦 because 💁 it does 🏋 not ⛔ particularly matter assuming same 🤢 perking and tiers
    • That 😩 being said, 🙅 you *must* 🔐😠 (outside 😏 of 💥 very niche 👩 cases) always 😣 ensure 👌💰 that 👌👌 when 💦 you 👉😭 do 👌🤦 an 😤 auto into 😩🚪 a channeled, that 💯👉 the channeled ability 👉👉 is 😍 done ✔ with 🆕 Dw (this 👈 is 😃😯 mostly 💆💁 important for Asphyxiate, as 🅰😅 Concentrated Blast 😂😫 is 😯 already 😂 Dw locked, and Smoke Tendrils is not ❎ relevant)
        - This 👈 is 😳🍏 because 👏 of 😤 the fact 📕 that when 💦🕛 the ⬇🐘 channeled hits 🎯👊 reset your auto cd, it 😫 is going to 💦👉 reset it 😂🤔 based 😣😫 off the weapon ⚔ you are 💯♂ wearing, 👙 thus 👌 if 🚫 you 🐶😁 staff asphyx, when 🍑 your 👉👏 asphyx ends your auto 🤖 is ❌ on a 🏖 6t cooldown again 😭
        - The 👏 table 😡😾 below 😫 will 💰 showcase two ✌ different 👉👱 scenarios:
```
2H Asphyxiate:

You 👈 MUST 😩 do:
auto 🤖 + asphyxiate → ability 👉 → dw abil → auto 🤖🤖 + ability 👉👉

Dw Asphyxiate:

You 👈🤝 can 🔫💦 do:
auto + asphyxiate → dw ability 👉👉 → auto 🤖 + ability 👉
```

**__Text Based Guide__**
⬥ The 💳 basic 🚂😶 principles is 😈💦 you 😮🔥 can 🔫✈ do lossless spellcasting by 👋 hitting a 👌🅱 spell from 😂 actionbar (lossless meaning you 💗 don't 🙈 lose 😱 ticks performing the 🔥👌 action) 💪💪
    • This lets 👈👉 you auto the 💦 same 💩♂ tick as 🍑 you use ❌ an ability 👉👉 (input ➡ is ❤ auto 🤖 → abil)

.
⬥ When you can autoattack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: <:praeswand:643166769518739477> = 4t and <:noxstaff:513190159294922753> = 6t

.
⬥  Your delay after an action 💪 is 🤔 given by 👏 max(currentdelay, delay from 😮 action) 💪🤚
    • Implications from this are 👴 that 😻💦 if 👩✈ you do ✔💕 a wand 😥 ability 👉👉 you'll 👈 be able to 😪 autoattack 4 🏳🌈 ticks after. If 🏿🅱 you 👵 do 🅱😀 a staff ability, 👉 you will 🏿👋 be 🍆 able 💪💪 to autoattack 7 ⏰💯 ticks after. 😩👀

**__4TAA Additional Info__**
⬥ **Note that this is just a practice rotation**. Wrack <:wrack:535533809823645697> is generally not a good basic ability to use in combat and is only utilized here due to it's very short cooldown. In real combat, replace Wrack with Dragon Breath <:dbreath:535533833391702017>, Corruption Blast <:corruptblast:513190159194259467>, Impact <:impact:535533809655873556>, Wild Magic <:wm:535533809978966037>, etc.
⬥ When ⤴🕛 practising, set 👌 the 😠👏 combat dummy 😘 to 'Max Hit Mode' then take 📴 note 📝🗒 of 😳 how 😕 much 👌💯 damage ☠☠ your Staff auto 🤖 attack deals compared to 💦💰 a 👌 Wand ⚡😥 auto attack. 🤼⚔ To 😘♂ benefit from 🏽😂 4TAA, you want 🕑 to 💦 consistently do 🙅👀 Staff auto attacks.
⬥ Step 👣 4 must 💪🔐 be 💄🐝 done in quick 🛀 succession; all 🛑🌎 inputs must 👏 be ❌👬 done within one tick. To make this 😢🏻 easier on 👇 yourself try keybinding your 😩👉 Wand/Orb/Auto ⚡ in 🔙👏 an 👹🐎 easy 👌❓ to reach 🏾🏾 set 👌🕸 of 😕👏 keystrokes.
⬥ This 🐸 guide only 🏼 covers the 🅱🅱 basic pattern of 💦💦 4TAA. Once you're confident in 😩🚪 performing steps 👏 1-6, ⛈ try to 💦♀ mix and 🔬 match 🏻😤 other basic 😀🌑 abilities to 💦😘 create 📲📲 your own 4TAA rotation.
⬥ You will 👀👏 know 👅 you 😍 did 🏻🙀 not 😅 lose 😱 any 💦🍵 ticks between 🍼 auto 🤖🤖 and 💦 abilities if 👏 you 🚀 do not ❌ see the auto 🤖🤖 firing 🔫🔫 animation, 🛌 but the 🏻 auto 🤖 itself 👈 still ⏰ firing 🔫

While practising you 😩 may 🦋🌌 be unsure if you are messing up 🔺 or not, 🚫 so 👌🆙 the following clips will 💰🌳 showcase various scenarios: too 💊 fast, 🚦 correctly, ✔🤗 and too 💗 slow

*Note: the Auto damage in all the following clips is 2515*   

.
**__Too Fast__**
This means you 👆🏿 simply 😡 did 🙀🏻 not wait the 👮 additional tick required ✅ for 👨 the 🏥 auto, and so 👏💯 casted your ability 👉👉 at GCD end 😂🏼 instead 💴 of 1 ♂⛈ tick after 👅👀 GCD end 🔚😂 to get 🉐 an Auto 🤖🤖 + Ability
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/eYF30FV.mp4 
.
**__Correctly__**
This 👉👇 means you 💦 did 🙀 it 😝 correctly, 🤗✔ this will ⚽ demonstrate how 😐 it looks 👉 like 🏼 in 📥🔥 both Normals and 🍏 Ancients Spellbooks
⬥ If 👏🤔 you did not ❌🚫 mess 💦💦 up 🅱🔺 on 🚟 Normals, you 👦 will 😜🐼 not 😥❌ get 🍌🉐 the 🌊🌊 Auto casting animation and 👎 you 💯👈 will 🏾 see 🚨👀 the 🌞 auto 🤖 still be fired 😤 out.

⬥ If 👏🏃 you 👧 did not mess 😄 up on 💪🔛 Ancients, you will 👏 not 🉐❌ get the 👏👧 Auto 🤖🤖 casting animation. 🍑
    • As 💰 you can 💦 also see, the Auto 🤖 and Ability are 💨🔢 cast as the 🕵🔪 GCD bar 😫😫 flashes
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/7NnF9f6.mp4
.
**__Too Slow__**
This ⁉😆 means 🤔😏 you were 👌👶 too late 🕐 to 👉💦 cast your auto + ability, 👉 typically this 👈 results in 🕶 a 👌💰 5TAA (auto cast on tick 4, 🏳✌ ability 👉 cast on 👎💰 tick 5), or 💰 worse (ability cast far 💶👉 later). 🕘🕑

More specifically, 🔵🔵 it means 🚫😏 your ability 👉👉 will ⚽🤷 be delayed as 👦 your 👈👏 auto will 🅱 automatically fire 🔥 on 🍆 the 👏💬 4th tick either 😤 way, assuming you did not 🙅 off
