> **__Revolution__**
.tag:Revo
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ 🔫 is 😳 a 🔫 combat 🗡 mode wherein you can toggle the 👏 game 🏅💣 to automatically 😩 activate basic, 🌑 threshold, and 👏 ultimate abilities automatically 😩😩 upon 💰 reaching the 🔼💰 required 📋📋 adrenaline. 💉 

.
⬥ While ⏳⌛ we do not encourage using Revo++ as 😠 it 🚫👊 limits the 👏🏛 amount of ❤😢 control 🏻 a 🦑 player has 👏 over 👏 their 🍮💦 own rotation, it is 🈁😜 low-input and ⚔ low ⬇ maintenance. 

.
⬥ Revo++ can ♂ be 🐝🙋 desirable for afking, low-effort 👏 pvm, or 💁😣 slayer tasks. 

.
⬥ Here is 🎤😲 an 👹 ability 👉👉 bar 🥃🍻 we 👨🔞 recommend for 🍆🎄 Revo++. Using 🤳 this 😭 recommended ability 👉👉 bar 😫 with 🙅 zero player 🤺 input 🚾➡ you 👩 can 🔊🔫 achieve 😌 a ☢🅱 DPM of 👏 roughly 130k.
    • DW revo++ bar 🍻

⬥ To 👉✡ toggle on ↕👋 revolution++ 👺 and highlight how 🅰 many abilities to 💦 trigger 🔫🔫 with 👏 it, click the 👏🅱 cog icon 🔔🔔 on 💰 your 👈🤖 ability 👉👉 bar:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/aI8RM8r.png

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
⬥ Revolution (not 🚫 revo++) is a 💰👌 combat 🕰 mode wherein basic abilities are 💰💰 used 🆒 automatically by the 👏 game 🎮 but ☹ threshold and ultimate abilities are 😬😎 manually activated. 

.
⬥ Newer players 🎮📱 may 📅 find 🔍 this 👈 combat 🔫♂ mode helpful 😚😲 starting 🤠 out as 👦 it 😢😩 allows for 😏🍆 some 🍆 control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic 🚂🌑 abilities. 

.
⬥ Below 😫 is 🏻 an ability 👉 bar we recommend to use for 🎁👧 revolution. 🔫 
    • DW revolution 👺💥 bar
.img:https://i.imgur.com/w0sVzOo.png
    • 2h revolution bar 😫🥃
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1zvgPM9.png
.
    • Note that 🚟 the thresholds and 👏 ultimate abilities can 💦 be placed in any 👏 order ❌ as 🍑 it ✊💡 does 🏋❓ not 😅 matter 🏻 where they are on 🔛 the bar − you 😍 will 🍡 be 🐝 manually activating them. 😄 

.
⬥ If you 😛🤤 are new to 💦 using 📤🏻 revolution, simply ⤵😡 let 👀 revo use basic 🚂🌑 abilities for you. 👏👉 
    • Activate Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> once you reach 100% adrenaline. From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>). Repeat.

.
⬥ Following this simple repeating pattern of *Build to 100% -> Berserk - > Thresholds -> Repeat*, one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is 😩☎ a 😠 combat ♂🔫 mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by 💕👨 the player. 💰👨 
    • No automatic inputs from 🤤🌎 the 🏞💯 game 🎮 means no ❌🚫 damaging abilities will be 🐝 done, 👌🍆 therefore this mode requires high 🆙 input from the 💰⏰ player.

.
⬥ The benefit 😩 of this 👁👌 mode is that 😐 it 🤤😰 allows for 🍆 the greatest ☺ degree 👅 of 🏻 control 💂🏻 over 😏😏 which abilities are used 📅 in 😩 any 💦🏼 given 👤 scenario. 

.
⬥ Most 🦁🐶 high level 🆙🔻 pvmers opt to 👅💦 use ℹ👏 this ⬆👁 combat 🏹🏹 mode. 

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it 💯😏 does 🏋 not matter 🤛♻ where you 👉😫 place 🏡 your 🤗 abilities on your 📱👨 bar with 👏🙀 full 🌕🈵 manual, you 🚫👆 may still find 🔎💭 it 😍🍆 helpful 😚 to organize your bar 😫😫 based on 👄💦 basics to 💦 thresholds to 🖇 ultimate. 
    • Refer to 😊💦 the revolution 👺💥 bars 💯🔥 as 👌 examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from revo to 🔭➡ full manual can 🍆🤕 seem intimidating but 😎🤔 all it 😩 takes 💜 is practice. 🎯 

.
⬥ Most 😃 players 🎮💰 start 🎮⏸ by ⏩ letting ❌❌ revolution 👺 activate basics while they ✨ manually input ➡📫 thresholds and 🔙⏱ ultimates. 
    • The 👤👏 next 📆 step 👉 would 👉 be 👦🐝 to manually activate basic abilities too, 👉 with 👏👏 revolution 💥🔫 still 💢🤞 active 🙌 as 💎🍑 a 👌👌 failsafe. 
        - Once 💯 you feel ♂ confident in 📥 activating basic 🌑🌑 abilities manually, try 😐💪 turning 💫🙌 off 😂 revolution. 💥💥

.
⬥ An 👹➕ exercise ♂ to help 🚨😤 you 👉 here 🈁 is 📃 to 🔵💦 only 😤😤 use 👏 basics for 🍆 a 🌉👌 full 🌝 minute of 💦 combat 🗡🗡 on 📲 a 🚟❗ combat 🗡🏹 dummy. ❤😘 
    • Your 👀 goal 😫 is to not 🙅💉 lose 🚫 any 💦 ticks between basic abilities, either due 👅 to 💦 cooldowns or 🚪😩 due to 🙏🍒 not 🚫❌ manually activating the 😾🔚 next ⏩ ability 👉 fast ⏩ enough. 💦 

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat ♂🤼 dummy, 😘😘 try 😐🏃 on 🔛 a real 😏😤 boss 👨 such as 👦💑 GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or 🚨💁 GWD2 (Vindicta). 

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

> **__Overview - Melee DPS__**
.tag:Overview
**__Why to Return to Your Cave Man Roots__**
⬥ Compared to the 💅💦 other 😤🏽 two 💏 combat ♂ styles, Melee is 🌸🏼 unique in that 👨👈 it ☝😭 is ♻🏾 the 📐 only 👏🕦 combat style 😋 that 🙌♂ restricts you to 💧 a 👌🔥 maximum range of 💦🈸 1-2 distance away 🙅 from 👉👊 your 👉 target. 
    • As 👦 such, 😲🤤 it 🍆 is 💦👌 inherently more ✔😭 difficult to 👍👉 deal with certain boss 👨💼 mechanics 💰 at such 😩 a 💰👨 close ↔ range. 🤤🤤

.
⬥ The ⏪ trade-off, 📜📜 and 👅 many 💯👧 players 📱 find this 😣💯 trade-off 📜📜 worth 💵💵 the 🏿 disadvantages, is 🍅💦 that Melee is 🅱 unquestionably the highest 🤑 DPS style 😂👏 of 🔉 the 👉 three 💁💁 combat styles. 

.
⬥ Melee can 💦 reach 🤝🤠 a 🍂 ceiling of 💦🍆 220k DPM whereas Mage and 👏👏 Range cap out 💦🏍 at around 🕦🔄 200k DPM.

.
⬥ Melee is ❌ also ☹ unique in that to 👉 achieve such 😲 a 🐶 high ☝ DPM benchmark a variety 🥓🥑 of weapon 🚮 switches are 🙏👏 needed 🤒🤒 - more so ‼💒 than 👉 the 👏👏 other 🏾👪 styles. 
    • Since 👨👨 obtaining weapon switches is *not* ❌🙅 a linear 💨💨 path 🛣 (ie. players ☹ likely choose weapon ⚔ switches based on 😂 cost), the progression path of 👯 melee makes less 〽 sense 💰💰 in 👈🛌 DPM thresholds and 💰👏 more sense in terms of 🐲 gradual incorporation of 👌 weapon 🚮🚮 switches.

.
⬥ Having said that, 👏 PVME recommends upgrading your ➡ melee kit in ➡ this 🚙 order 📑 (ordering is 💦 based 😲 off 🏾🤤 of most 🐶 useful upgrade descending to 👸💦 the 👏💯 least 🔻💯 useful upgrade - NOT 🚫🚫 based 👌 on 😛💩 cost). 🤤💲

.
**__Choosing a Drygore__**
⬥ It ♂ is 😂 recommended to 💦💦 use a 🔥 Drygore Mace and 📎 either ♂ a 💩 Off-hand ♂ Drygore Longsword or Off-hand 💦 Drygore Rapier. 
    • Note 📝🎵 that 👨🔍 all 🗿🌚 Drygores have 👏 tier 👑👑 90 💯❌ ability 👉👉 damage, ☄☄ and if 🎅 only 🤣 using abilities, the choice 👐 of 🚋🅱 Drygores would make no difference.

.
⬥ If 👏🤔 considering auto attacks, maces have 🤜 the 😫 fastest attack ⚔🤼 speed, and a 🅰 lower 😎🙅 auto 🤖 attack ⚔⚔ damage, whereas longswords and 🙏👏 rapiers have 😤 a 💰 slower 😩 attack speed for 🍆 a slightly higher ✅✅ auto 🤖 attack ⚔ damage. ☠ 
    • The above 👆🆙 combination 🔃🔃 of 👏💦 Drygores is optimal because you 👨👊 should 💘 never need mainhand autos, as 🏿😰 2h autos are always preferable, 👏 and the 💩 faster 🚀🔥 attack ⚔⚔ speeds allows for 🎁🙃 5 tick auto attacking. ♂ 
        - However, 🖐 when 🕕💦 making use 🏾 of 💦💦 freedom autos, then off-hand attack ⚔🤼 speed ⏩⏩ is considered.

**__What to Pack for Your Camping Trip__**
⬥ Camping in 🌝 this ☝👈 context 😎 refers to 💦 the 💻 exclusive usage of either DW or 🕍 2H without taking 💅 advantage of 👏🐣 the 💞👏 benefits from 😲↘ switching. 🔥🔥 

.
⬥ Most 😤 players 💰💰 will start 🔘🆕 learning 🤗 melee by grabbing a 2h or 😇🍆 DW and 💰〰 camping with 😍 said 🏿 weapon. 

.
⬥ While 💯👱 you 🕯👂 are 🔢 limited to 👀 what 😱 rotations you can ☺ do 👌 while camping 2h or DW, it 💋 is 😯 still important ✅❌ to 💯 optimize with what 😡 you 👈 have. 🌈

.
⬥ Your rotation will be generally built around either Lesser Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> or Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527>, depending on availability.
    • High damage basics such as Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> (2h exclusive), Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> (DW exclusive), and Sever <:sever:535532879577612298> should be used as often as possible following Fury. 

.
⬥ Rotations will follow a simple scheme: Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> → Ability → Ability → Repeat.

.
⬥ The general idea is to build to your Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, and then within Berserk, use Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, then either Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (DW) or Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> (2h), and then if you have the adrenaline to spare, use either Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (DW) or Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> (2h).

    • Two-Handed 💏💏
Build to 100% → Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> → Repeat

.
    • Dual 🔫🔫 Wield
Build to 100% → Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> → Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → Repeat

.
⬥ Note 🎵 that for 😤 1v1 situations, DW is 👩👉 more damage. In 1vMany situations, 2h deals more ➕ damage. ☠

> **__Weapon Switch Invention Perks__**
.tag:SwitchPerks
**__Flanking 4__**
⬥ Flanking is a 🚓👬 perk ⏫ unlocked via 💰💰 Invention at 💯🍆 level 🍒 55. 
    • The effect states 👌👌 `Backhand, Impact and 👏 Binding Shot 😰🔫 no 🚫♂ longer stun and 🙏🏳 deal 40% more 🙅🤦 damage per 👼 rank to targets that 💀 are 🔢💩 not facing 😫😫 you. 😘 Forceful Backhand, Deep Impact and 👏 Tight 😩🔝 Bindings no ♂🏻 longer stun and ➕ deal 15% 🔟 more damage per 👼👼 rank to 😘🔭 targets that 💵🏻 are 💯💯 not 😠 facing 😫 you` and goes 💦 up 👎 to rank 4. ✌😭

.
⬥ Should 👌😫 the 🌎 opportunity 📊 arise at 💦💋 group bosses flanking can be 😝😠 incredibly powerful. 
    • Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> becomes your 2nd most powerful basic inside of Berserk while Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> becomes your 4th best threshold in Berserk. 
        - The basic 🚂 ability Backhand should 😀😎 be 🐝 used 🚟 as 🍑🏿 often 😵😵 as 🍑 possible and ➕ the 👭 threshold 🤝🤝 Forceful Backhand should be used 🚟😏 either 😤🤷 in Berserk or 💁 in-between 👇👌 Berserk cooldowns. 

.
**__Example Rotations with Flanking:__**
⬥ 2h Camping 
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Forceful Backhand-Flanking <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → Repeat

.
⬥ DW Camping
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> → Forceful Backhand-Flanking <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → Repeat

.
*Note that for DW, once you have Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> unlocked it should be used as your 3rd threshold inside Berserk. Flanking would be downgraded to a threshold used in-between Berserk cooldowns.*

.
⬥ This perk should be placed on a Dual Wield Off-hand switch and upgraded to your highest tier available (Drygore <:drygorelongmh:513190158900658180> t90 or dyed-Khopesh <:barrowskhopeshmh:580176857144492042> t92). 

.
⬥ Example bosses to bring flanking to include: Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082>, Angel of Death <:aod:580167371365548042>, group ED1-3 <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>, Solak <:solak:580167371310891029>, and any other group bossing.

.
**__Lunging 4__**
⬥ Lunging is 😂 a perk ⏫ unlocked 🔓 via 💰 Invention ❗ at level 🎚 89.
    • The 🥁 effect 📣🐆 states `The maximum damage ☄ of 😏💦 Combust, Dismember and Fragmentation shot 🔫 is 😄😩 incrased by 20% 🔳🔳 weapon damage per 👼 rank, but 🍑🍑 enemies that 👌😳 move 🏼 will only 👃🏼 take 👦✋ 1.5x ⚖💪 increased ➕➕ damage.` and 🔝 goes 🙊 up to 👏🔨 rank 4. 😭 

.
⬥ The only basic bleed in melee affected by Lunging is Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>. 
    • Since Dismember cannot be 🅱 walked 🏽 to gain bonus damage, ☄☄ the effects of Lunging will 🍆 always activate for Dismember, thus 👌🕵 it ➡😂 is 🔮🙈 **strictly** an 🐎🍆 upgrade over non-lunging 🏆 Dismember. 
    • In 👠 fact, 👏 the 🤜👏 effect 🐆🐆 of Lunging is 🔪 extra 😜 strong 💪 on Dismember *because* ♂🤔 Dismember cannot be 🐝 walked (the 👏 same 😯 applies to the 👏 99 💵🤑 Strength 💪 Cape effect). 
        - With Lunging 4 and Strength Cape effect combined, Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> becomes the **strongest basic ability** for melee outside of Berserk.

.
⬥ Dismember should 👌💦 be 😒 used outside Berserk as 🍑 bleeds do 👌🏻 not 🚫 get boosted damage (Dismember has 👉👏 a 🍆 15s cooldown so 🆗 you 👈🤣 should 💦 plan to use 👏 Dismember before 😲🕰 a 🐶🐖 Berserk, then 🍆 20s later, use 👏🏾 Dismember after 👀 a 😼 Berserk).

.
⬥ The goal ⬆ is 💦 to ✌ have 💰🐵 100% 💯 uptime of the 🍆👏 Dismember effect 🐆 when 👆🍑 using 📤🤳 Lunging4 + Strength Cape.

.
⬥ A Dual Wield Off-hand switch should be used for this perk and later upgraded to a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:masterworkspearofannihilation:694566917456789554> due to it further extending the duration of Dismember.

**__DW and 2H Weapon Switching__**
⬥ The 🗣💦 biggest 🏻 jump 🏻 in 👉 DPM will 🏿 come 🍆💦 from 😲 incorporating weapon 🚮 juggling of 😤💦 DW and 2h weapons. 

.
⬥ Having both weapon styles gives access to both DW Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> and 2h Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> basic abilities, each sporting a strong 188% ability damage and a low 7s cooldown. 
    • Even ☎ if you ☝ have to 🔧 pair a high 🙏 tier 👑👑 weapon 🗡⚔ with 👀 a 🅰🎮 lower tier weapon, 🏹🗡 the 👏 ability to 🙅💦 access 🚪🚪 both 👩 Deci/Cleave is worth 💵💰 it 😂 (eg. Drygores with 👏↔ Dragon 🐉 Rider Lance). 

.
⬥ With 😭 DW/2h Switching, 🔥🔥 it is 👍 possible to break beyond the 👏👩 170k DPM barrier that ✔😧 Camping generally 😄 struggles to overcome. 💦💦

**__2h vs DW Assault__**
⬥ Assault hit splats will 🐼👏 land 💯 at different 💰 times ⏲ depending on whether ☂📊 it 🅱 is 💦🏻 cast with ↔💰 2h or 💯 DW. 
    • The timing to cancel it ❓💁 remains ♂♂ unchanged.
```2 4 6 🕕 8 🤔👊 for 🎅⌛ 2h
3 👏😘 5 😂 7 9 ✝😉 for 🐻🍆 dw```

> **__Auto Attacks__**
.tag:AutoAttacks
**__What They are and When to Use Them__**
⬥ Once 💯 you've incorporated DW/2h Switching, auto 🤖🤖 attacks become 🤦 more 🅱🙅 prevelant as 🍑🖕 a 👏👌 dps tool. 🛠

.
⬥ When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: DW <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> = 4t, 2h <:zgs:626465964325601290> = 6t.

.
⬥ We will be using 🤳🤳 2h auto 🤖🤖 attacks as 💰😅 they 😢👬 deal more 👉 damage.

⬥ There are 🙏♀ two 🎄 specific instances of 🛢 when ⏰ you 👏 want 💁🙄 to 💯 incorporate auto 🤖 attacks into your rotation; one 😅😣 is 'passive', the 👨 other 👈👪 will 💰♀ is 💦👏 5taa.

.
**__'Passive' Auto Attacks__**
⬥ By performing a 👌😝 non-damaging 🏆 ability with DW equipped, the auto 🤖🤖 attack ⚔ cooldown is 🅱 initiated and begins ✔👉 counting 🔢 down; 5t cooldown, a 🌎🏿 GCD is 🍊🔥 3t. 

.
⬥ After 🍊 GCD, waiting 🚼⌚ an additional 2t would mean 👍☝ your auto 🤖🤖 attack 🤼⚔ becomes 📉 available again. 😬😸 

.
⬥ By swapping to 💦💦 a 👌🏽 2h, an auto attack ⚔ can be 🤔🎮 used 📅👨 by 😀 clicking on your target (click BEFORE inputting an 😯😘 ability). 👉👉

.
⬥ Auto attacks can 😜 deal up to 🌬💰 5k damage, ☠ 8k in 👉 a Berserk and 👏👏 in 👆👏 most ☺🦁 cases 💼💼 is worth 🌐 the 😬 2t wait. 

.
⬥ You can perform an auto attack on every Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> activation by doing the following:
Equip DW → Berserk → Swap to 2h and 👏💦 wait ✋✋ 2t → Click 🖱🖱 target (Auto 🤖 Attack) 🤼🤼 → Continue with 👏😣 Zerk rotation

.
*Note: This technique becomes more prevelant with the introduction of Greater Barge, which is discussed later in this channel.* 
*Note: I call this section 'passive' auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. I would call this section 'loseless' though that is not technically true.*

.
**__5TAA__**
⬥ Auto attacks can 😧 be used 😏📅 'actively' in 👇 what's known 👁👀 as 😰😎 5taa. 

.
⬥ Similar 💯👱 to mage, the idea 👌💡 is 😍💦 to 🌈💦 use ⚒💁 a ❔ 2h auto 🤖🤖 attack ⚔ every other ability, 👉 in 🙌👏 a 🚨 pattern of: 😂 
Auto 🤖 Attack ⚔⚔ → Ability1 → Ability2 → Repeat. 🔂 
.
https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 🐕😮
.
⬥ Ability2 must be 🐝 a DW ability 👉👉 and 🍇⚡ must 😡 not be 📖👶 a 💬🙄 channeled ability. 

.
⬥ Input 🚾 Ability1 as soon ⌛⌛ as 🖕 you see 👁👁 the 💰👏 sword swing animation 💦🍆 from 🅱🍆 the 👏 Auto 🤖 attack. 
    • Timing will 😳 take 🐤 practice. 
    • There ✔👉 are 🔢🔢 no 🚫 restrictions on what 👏 Ability1 can be. 🐝 

.
⬥ This 😞 rotation has a 👌🏻 similar 💯👱 damage ☠ output compared to 🎉 the Deci/Cleave rotation and 🌚 is 🌇☝ **situationally** utilized when you 👉😕 run out 🏎 of 💦😫 'good' 😇😊 abilities. 
    • Remember, Auto 🤖 attacks are not abilities so ‼👬 they 👥💥 are always 👏⏳ available. ✔💢
.
https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ
.
**__Major Downsides of 5TAA to Consider:__**

⬥ Slower 😩😩 adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 🎁🙅 3% 💦💵 adrenaline. 💉 
    • Since 👨👨 you 🏾🏿 are 🏻 doing 🏿😧 an 😅😘 auto 🤖 every ⓜ🏼 other 👪👦 ability, coupled with standing 🏿🏿 idle for 2 💦🍆 ticks every 👏 other ability, you gain adrenaline 💉💉 at 🕛💁 a ❌ much slower pace 🏿 than 💰 with 👀😠 traditional 📵📵 rotations.

⬥ There is no button 💯🔥 to 👶😓 force 👊♀ melee auto 🤖🤖 attacks.
    • This means you ⁉🏻 have 💪 to stand 👫 idle for 2 ticks after Ability2 and *wait* ✋🙅 for 💯🍆 the auto 🤖 attack to 💦🅱 come 💦💺 out, 🤣💦 before 🤔 inputting your 👈📃 next ▶ ability. 
    • Proper timing will require 📜 practice. 🍆 
        - Input 📫 an 😮🏻 ability too fast and you 🙇 lose 😱🚫 the 💞⭐ Auto attack. 🤼🤼 
        - Input 📫➡ an ability too 💦 slow 😳👏 and you 🤛👉 lose DPS. 

⬥ These 🚱 two ✌ reasons are 😎 why ❓❓ 5taa is 🤔🈶 a situational technique though it ❔ is 🤚😩 still worth 💰 mentioning.

.tag:DeviatingUpgradePath
**__Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood__**
*Note: As with any upgrade path, feel free to ask any questions you have in <#656898197561802760>*

.
⬥The 🏕 prioritization of 🔝💦 upgrades can 🔫 vary depending on 😆 what your 👅🍎 focus 🅱😩 is with 🤝❌ PvM. 
    • The remaining upgrades are also ➕ very ✅📈 expensive, 💵💵 varying from 💋💩 100m to 💦💦 1b.

.
⬥ If you will be primarily doing Vorago or Solak, it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.     • Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds.

.
⬥ If you're more interested 💦 in 😛🚫 bosses such 👌 as 👂 Angel 👼 of 😤😱 Death, Raids 🔛🔛 - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, or faster 🔥 kills ☠ at Araxxor, it is 🏻 recommended to buy a Zaros Godsword. 
    • Its extremely 🏆 powerful 💪💪 special attack ⚔⚔ greatly improves your 😄 sustained DPM.

.
⬥ At 🏠 high 😍 defense bosses such 🤤❤ as Vorago, Angel 👼 of Death, 💀 and ➕💩 Raids 🔛👈 - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is 👏🤔 recommended to 😔 pick 🆙⛏ up a 🚬 Statius' Warhammer. 
    • It 🤔😽 has a special 👾🎁 attack which significantly lowers defences for 🍆 1 🏫🌅 minute. ⏰⌚ 

.
⬥ In the end 😂🔜 you 😐😩 should 😫💘 aim to 🎖 grab 👐 all 😍✊ three 🏫🏾 of 😤♂ these 😍 upgrades.

.
**__Zaros Godsword__**
⬥ The Zaros Godsword <:zgs:626465964325601290> is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'. 
    • Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792>), buffs damage by 25% and lasts for 20 seconds. 
    • It 💯🏼 should be 💄 used 👨 in 🌍👏 rotation with 👏 Berserk (ie. 🅱 use Blackhole when Berserk is on 👍➡ cooldown) OR 🍆💰 when 🍑 the 🌧 situation ✊👊 is 💦😤 too 🍆 dangerous 😱🔥 to 💦 Berserk in. 👉 

.
*Note that you do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range.*

.
⬥ ZGS rotations are 🐙 similar 💯 to Berserk rotations but 🤔🏾 vary based 💯👌 on 🏿 the 🙌🎊 boss. 🏽😎 

.
⬥ As for 💰 adrenaline potions, it ❔ is 😤💦 recommended to 🏽✡ save adrenaline 💉💉 potions for 👥 Berserk as 👦🍑 it is 🤔 more valuable in 🏼 Berserk with 👏🙀 its higher ✅✅ damage modifier.

.
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + Adrenaline Potion <:replenpot:641337470491033600> / Limitless Sigil <:limitless:641339233638023179> → Berserk Cooldown → ZGS Special → ZGS Cooldown → Repeat

.
**__Statius' Warhammer__**<:swh:641670143197446182>
⬥ One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability <:ingen:641339234111848463>. 

.
⬥ If you intend to ⚖👈 do 😂👌 group 🅱 PvM it 🙌 is 👶❌ recommended to 💰🎲 buy a SWH and 😩 use 😂👏 its special 😂🏽 attack at 👉😤 high 🆙 defence bosses (eg. 🅾🅱 Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast 😋 Master, Angel 😇 of 🚋 Death). 👻 

.
⬥ Usage of 💦😕 the SWH varies from 🌎 boss 👨 to 💦 boss 💼 and 🐟💦 will be 🐝👏 covered more 💵🚫 specifically in 👏🏡 our 🔥🔥 boss 🏽☝ guides.

.
**__Greater Barge__** 
⬥ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex and transforms your lesser Barge ability to Greater Barge. 

.
⬥ The description 👿 of 💦🚑 Greater 👅 Barge is 🅰 as follows: 🏃🚗
`Greater 👅 barge requires the 🏆😃 player to stop 👏👍 attacking their ⬅💯 target for 👅👍 3 💵👏 seconds 😫 (5 🌺 ticks, roughly 2 🔅 GCD). At this point, the 👑🎅 greater 👅 barge icon 🔔 will show up 🔺 on 🔛 your ⛵🏡 buff bar. This 🌈🎊 indicates that 👊 the 🌈 gbarge buff 💪 is ready ✔😍 to ✌💦 be activated. Barge your 💍👉 target, and a 💬 Provoke icon 🔔 will 👏 appear ‼⁉ on ➡😖 your 👃 buff bar with 😣😣 a 🖼👌 10 🔟 tick (roughly 3 💵 GCD) timer. At any point ⬆📌 during these 👈 10 🔟 ticks any ❌🍵 channeled ability 👉 you 🙀 cast will 🏻👻 become a damage-over-time bleed 💉 instead.` 🤷 
.
https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw 😮
.
⬥ This 👉 effect 🐆🐆 is 👏 **EXTREMELY** 😝 powerful 💪💡 and can 💰👍 create 📲 lots ✅ of burst DPS. 

.
⬥ It 😂😍 is also extremely useful in 👇👇 any scenarios where 😾👏 you are forced to 💦 stop ❌ attacking 🤼♂ due to ♂ a 💰✝ mechanic (eg. 🅱🅾 reflecting Web at 🏾💁 Araxxor, phasing at 😝 Yakamaru pools, ♂ reflects at 💰 Vorago, phasing at Solak, etc) as 😖🍑 these 👈 downtimes allow for 🍆 Greater 👅👅 Barge to 💦🙌 proc its 👉🆗 waiting initial 💰 effect.

.
⬥ The 👏🏡 applications of this 👏👈 are 🚟 explored moreso in 😩 our specific boss 👴 guides but generally 😄 it 💯☔ is ⚠👏 used 📅📅 as 🍑 follows: ♀
Wait 5 ticks to proc Greater Barge → Barge Target → Activate channeled threshold (eg. Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, or Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>) → Continue DPS rotation within next GCD.

⬥ Greater 👅 Barge is 🤔 also often 💰 used 🚟 in 👏 tandom with Berserk and 👏 Greater 👅 Flurry for 🕒 even more burst DPS. Starting the ✝🔑 rotation at ❤ 92% adrenaline: 💉
Anticipate <:anti:535541306475151390> → Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → gBarge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> → Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (bleed) → Continue with DPS

.
⬥ Using 🤳 greater flurry as 🍑 gBarge's bleed will ⚽ allow its full 💯 duration to take ✍ effect thereby lowering Berserk's cooldown. 
    • In this rotation, Anticipate can be replaced with Resonance <:res:535541258844635148> if you think you will have a hard time surviving after you Berserk. 

.
**__Notes on gBarge__**
⬥ Multiple people can stack a gBarge 'bleed' 💉💉 on the 👏 same 🤷🏆 target and they will 👙 not 🚫🚫 override each 👏👏 other. 

.
⬥ Equipping a ⛄🅱 different 🈯 tier 👑👑 weapon 🏹 *after* 🍆 you 👉 apply 🤔😤 the bleed will 🚫 change 💰 the ♀ bleed's damage ☠ according 🔛🔛 to 🙌💦 the 👩 latter weapon 🔫 tier. 👑👑 
    • For 🔜🎅 example, if you 👈 apply the 🤔 gBarge bleed 😳 with 😍👏 Drygores (t90) equipped, then 👱 switch 💑 to 😣😱 ZGS (t92) the ⏰🏻 damage ☠ will be 👏 calculated as 😅🎨 a 👏 t92 weapon. ⚔🔫

.
⬥ If 🔎 the 👨 initial 💵💰 weapon has ❌👩 a 🐭🌇 special effect 🐆📣 against ✊🔫 a 🎟😂 target, the 👏🐕 effect can 🔫💦 activate *after* ❌ you ⁉ switch 🎚🎚 to ✌ another 🏊👣 weapon. ⚔⚔ 
    • For example, apply a gBarge bleed with Terrasaur Maul<:terramaul:602561894829522954> then switching to Khopeshes will apply its special buff against Ranged monsters during its bleed calculations, to give T92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5%.

.
⬥ During Yakamaru's Stun Pool, 🌊🌊 mbarging a 👀 Destroy ability 👉 will still 🍺🙄 apply 🤔🤔 its 🙅 stun effect for 💰❤ the 👏 entire 4 💦🙏 hits. 🎯🎯 This 👈 can 👄 be 😎 a costly 💵💰 mistake.

.
⬥ Akin to note 👋 2, 💕 switching 🔥 to 💦 a flanking weapon 🗡🗡 during 🏃 the 👏 gBarge bleed 😳 effect will 🙋👏 null the stun effect. 🐆 

.
⬥ Normally Vorago will ✊ clear 📝 bleeds at 😩 the start 🔘 of 💦💦 its 🆗 Reflect mechanic. 
    • Since 💦 gBarge is ✔ not a true 💯⭐ bleed, 😳😳 it will 💰😬 not 😖 clear the bleed 😳 effect. 🐆 
    • This 😎😂 makes 💘💘 it 👊🍆 very 😔 easy to 👍 PK teammates if you have 👏 miscounted auto 🤖 attacks. 
    • Use 🖐👏 with caution ✋ at 🎖♂ Vorago.

.
⬥ There is ☝⁉ currently ⌚⌚ a ⏰👌 glitch that 😐 prevents ♀ the gBarge bleed 😳 effect 🐆 from 🔛👉 procing, despite ♂ having 👉😋 been outside 🚪🚭 of 😤 combat 🏹 for the 🏻 required ✅✅ duration. 
    • It 👏 is 💦 currently 🚟 thought 😢 to 👏 be ➡👌 caused by 😈😈 being 🔜🔥 out 🏍 of 😰 combat 🗡🗡 for 👥👦 10 seconds 😫 with 👏🍨 no 🙅 target, then 🏿🅱 re-entering combat 🔫 with 👏👯 gBarge, though 💥💭 the 🛩😶 causes of this 😆 glitch is 😦 still unclear.

.
**__Greater Fury__**
⬥ Greater 👅 Fury can be ➡➡ unlocked 🔓 through 🗺 consuming a ☢🦆 Greater 👅 Fury 😡 Ability 👉👉 Codex. 

.
⬥ This does 😈😻 two 💏 things: 💍 1) ♀ Fury 😡 is no longer 😏 a 📣👤 channeled ability 👉 and 😏 instead 👍👍 only hits 🎯👊 once ☝ dealing 🏾 157% ability 👉 damage, and 👏👴 2) 💯👑 gains 💪💪 an 😯📯 extra 🗣 effect 🐆📣 where 🌵🤷 getting 🍆😡 a 🌉🏻 critical hit 👏 with 👦 Fury 😡 will 👏👏 guarentee your 👈👉 next hit to be 👬 a 🅱 crit as 🏿🅰 well. 🤷🕳

.
⬥ The main benefit 😩😩 to this 😂⬆ upgrade is 💦 transforming this ⁉😍 ability from 👉 a 🅱 channeled ability to 💦👁 a 👌🔥 gcd ability. 👉👉 
    • This 👇🙎 allows fury 😡 to 👉♂ be used 📅🏭 in revo++ and 🔝🙇 revolution 🔫🔫 set ups without ❌ needing a 👍👌 manual input ➡ to 😄💦 cancel ❌❌ on 💪🎅 gcd. 

.
⬥ The 💤👏 crit effect 🐆 can also ➕ be ❌👶 beneficial to overall DPS though 🤗💭 it 🤐🤤 is random. 🔀

.
**__Greater Flurry__**
⬥ Greater 👅👅 Flurry can 🔫🔫 be 🏻 unlocked 🔓 through ☄▶ consuming a 👌 Greater 👅 Flurry Ability Codex. 

.
⬥ The 🍆🏻 effect 📣 states: 👌👌 
`Perform 👌 a 👌 flurry of 💦 blows against your 💦😩 surrounding targets, dealing 🚬 up 👭😍 to 94% weapon ⚔🗡 damage ☄☠ per 👼 hit 👊👊 over 💦 3.6 🗣🏼 seconds. If 👏👏 only one target is 👉😂 nearby, up 👀 to 157% weapon damage ☠☠ per hit 👊😪 will 😩 be 😎🐝 dealt instead. Additionally ➕ if 👏 an attack hits 🎯💥 any 🤔🍵 target per 👼 swing, the 🎁📖 cooldown of 👌 Berserk will 🅱 be 😱 reduced by 😈😈 1.2 👱💪 seconds 🕚 each 👏👏 swing.`

.
⬥ Once 🔥😩 you've 🤜 unlocked 🔓🔓 this 👇 threshold, 🤝 it 🍝✋ becomes your 🏼💦 3rd 👀👀 best 👌 threshold 🤝🤝 in 👈🙌 Berserk. 

.
⬥ In 📥👏 addition, ➕ its ⚜ unique 👰👰 effect of 👏💦 reducing Berserk cooldown is 👉 very 🙌📈 useful in 🔥👏 overall Melee rotations. 

.
⬥ There are several ways 😉😉 of 🔥💦 using 🤳🤳 GFlurry. 
    • You 👈 can 🔫🔫 either 😤😙 cancel ❌ it 😅😠 on 🏽♂ GCD (ie. 2 😍❌ hits) 👊💥 for 🐻🎄 burst damage, ☄ or ➕💰 use 👏👏 it for 👀 its 🙅 entire 👑 duration for ✋💘 its Berserk reduction effect. 
    • If 🏾 you bleed 💉 this threshold 🤝🤝 using 🤳📤 gBarge, all 💯🤞 bleed 💉😳 hits 👊🎯 will 👏🙏 contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. 
        - This 🆕 is 😤😩 used 🎶🏭 extensively at Aod and 👆 Solak where players 💰📱 want 👨 to 🏼🅱 Berserk as 🍑 often 😵 as possible 🔝🔝 through 👌▶ out 👀 the 👏🤔 fight.

.
**__Remaining Upgrades__**
⬥ At 👏😂 this 🏻🅱 stage, all 💦💯 important upgrades have 🈶 been 💴 obtained and all that remains is to get 👏✊ inherent DPM boosting upgrades. 
    • Following this, 😂😂 buy 🛍 either Khopeshes or 🅱💁 a 👌💍 T99 Codex, depending on 🔥➖ which one 💓☝ is 🈁🗑 cheaper. 
    • Then 🔙👱 it is 👶 encouraged ☺ to 🤣😷 start 🆕▶ picking up 🙌 things 💰💍 such 💦🔝 as 🏿🍑 Trimmed Masterwork (which 😩 is 👏🙀 very useful due 👅 to 💦⚫ its 🙅✊ set effect, 🐆🐆 and ✊ can 💦 save your ass 😩🍆 at 😩 times), ⏰⏰ and 🔛 dyed Lunging or Flanking switches.
