> **__Introduction__**
.tag:Intro
In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

> **__Revolution__**
.tag:Revo
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline.

⬥ While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance.

⬥ Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++. Using this recommended ability bar with zero player input you can achieve a DPM of roughly 130k.
    • DW revo++ bar

⬥ To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar:

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
⬥ Revolution (not revo++) is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated.

⬥ Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities.

.
⬥ Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution.
    • DW revolution bar
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/w0sVzOo.png
.
    • 2h revolution bar
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1zvgPM9.png
.
*Note: The thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar − you will be manually activating them.*

.
⬥ If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you.
    • Activate Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> once you reach 100% adrenaline. From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>). Repeat.

.
⬥ Following this simple repeating pattern of *Build to 100% -> Berserk - > Thresholds -> Repeat*, one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player.
    • No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player.

⬥ The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario.

⬥ Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate.
    • Refer to the revolution bars as examples.

⬥ Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice.

⬥ Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates.
    • The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe.
        - Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution.

.
⬥ An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy.
    • Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough.

⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta).

*Note: There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Overview - Melee DPS__**
.tag:Overview
**__Why to Return to Your Cave Man Roots__**
⬥ Compared to the other two combat styles, Melee is unique in that it is the only combat style that restricts you to a maximum range of 1-2 distance away from your target.
    • As such, it is inherently more difficult to deal with certain boss mechanics at such a close range.

⬥ The benefit is that Melee has the capability of dealing both great burst and sustained damage as central parts of its kits.

.
⬥ Melee can reach a ceiling of 220k DPM whereas Mage and Range cap out at around 200k DPM.

⬥ Melee is also unique in that to achieve such a high DPM benchmark a variety of weapon switches are needed - more so than the other styles.
    • Since obtaining weapon switches is *not* a linear path (ie. players likely choose weapon switches based on cost), the progression path of melee makes less sense in DPM thresholds and more sense in terms of gradual incorporation of weapon switches.

.
> **__Camping a Weapon__**
.tag:Camping
**__What to Pack for Your Camping Trip__**
⬥ Camping in this context refers to the exclusive usage of either DW or 2H without taking advantage of the benefits from switching.

⬥ Most players will start learning melee by grabbing a 2h or DW and camping with said weapon.

⬥ While you are limited to what rotations you can do while camping 2h or DW, it is still important to optimize with what you have.

.
⬥ Your rotation will be generally built around either Lesser Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> or Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527>, depending on availability.
    • High damage basics such as Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> (2h exclusive), Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> (DW exclusive), and Sever <:sever:535532879577612298> should be used as often as possible following Fury.

⬥ Rotations will follow a simple scheme: Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> → Ability → Ability → Repeat.

.
⬥ The general idea is to build to your Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, and then within Berserk, use Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, then either Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> (DW) or Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> (2h), and then if you have the adrenaline to spare, use either Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> (DW) or Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> (2h).

    • Two-Handed
Build to 100% → Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Quake <:quake:535532879506309150> → Repeat

.
    • Dual Wield
Build to 100% → Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> → Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → Repeat

*Note: For 1v1 situations, DW is more damage. In 1vMany situations, 2h deals more damage.*

.
> **__Intermediate and Advanced Tactics__**
.tag:IntAdvTactics
**__DW and 2H Weapon Switching__**
⬥ The biggest jump in DPM will come from incorporating weapon juggling of DW and 2h weapons.

⬥ Having both weapon styles gives access to both DW Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> and 2h Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> basic abilities, each sporting a strong 188% ability damage and a low 7s cooldown.
    • Even if you have to pair a high tier weapon with a lower tier weapon, the ability to access both Deci/Cleave is worth it (eg. Drygores with Dragon Rider Lance).

.
⬥ With DW/2h Switching, it is possible to break beyond the 170k DPM barrier that Camping generally struggles to overcome.

⬥ Example pairings of DW and 2h weapons:
    • t70 Abyssal Whip + Enhanced Excalibur
    • t80 Avaryss and Nymora Blades
    • t90 Elder Rune
    • t90 Drygores <:drygorelongmh:513190158900658180>
    • t92 Khopeshes <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> <:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>

    • t70 Any GWD1 Godsword
    • t80 Dragon Rider Lance <:dragonriderlance:643161541931171872>
    • t90 Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>
    • t92 Zaros Godsword <:zgs:626465964325601290>

.
⬥ Here we will abandon camping rotations built around Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> <:gfury:535532879334080527>
Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> <:gfury:535532879334080527> → Basic → Basic → Repeat.

⬥ Your new DW/2h rotations will be built around Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> and Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>
Deci <:deci:535532879325822986> → Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Ability → Ability → Repeat.
OR
Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Deci <:deci:535532879325822986> → Ability → Ability → Repeat.

⬥ Substitute 'Ability' with other strong basic abilities such as Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>, Sever <:sever:535532879577612298>, Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527>, Backhand-Flanking <:backhand:535532854302605333>, etc.
    • We use Deci/Cleave as often as possible as they each have a 7s cooldown and deal great damage at 188% ability damage.

.
**__Berserk Rotations with DW/2h Switching__**
*Note: These are different than the weapon camping rotations*
⬥ **With Adrenaline Pot**
Berserk<:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault<:assault:535532855191928842> → Destroy<:destroy:535532879330148352> → Forceful Backhand<:fbackhand:535532879346794516>

OR

Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> → Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>

⬥ **Without Adrenaline Pot**
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516>

OR

Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532855191928842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>

*Note: Use Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> over Forceful Backhand-Flanking <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> if you have it available*

.
**__2h vs DW Assault__**
⬥ Assault hit splats will land at different times depending on whether it is cast with 2h or DW.
    • The timing to cancel it remains unchanged.
```2 4 6 8 for 2h
3 5 7 9 for dw```

> **__Greater Barge__** <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
.tag:Gbarge
**__The Basics__**
⬥ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> can be unlocked by consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex, which then transforms your normal Barge <:barge:535532853916860437> ability into <:gbarge:535532879250456578>

.
⬥ Greater Barge works as follows:
    • It will break you free of binds, and where applicable bind a target for 11 ticks (6.6sec)
    • By default has a damage range of 25%-125%
        - However, for each tick (0.6sec) since the player stopped attacking their target, Greater Barge gains +10% to its max damage range, and +2% to its min, capping at 10 tick (6s) for +100% and +20%, for a final range of 45%-225%
    • If it has been atleast 8 ticks (4.8sec) since you stopped attacking it gains another effect, indicated by the Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> icon appearing on your Buff Bar, then it gains an additional effect:
        - Any melee channeled ability used within 10 ticks (6sec) of casting Greater Barge, indicated by the a Provoke-like <:voke:535541259465392143> icon appearing on your Buff Bar, will be turned into a damage-over-time (DoT) instead
        - For the sake of simplicity converting a channeled ability into a DoT is referred to as "bleeding" it, or having "bled" it, or you are going to "bleed" that threshold; however, these should not be confused with normal bleeds (e.g. <:dismember:535532879376023572>), as they are different.
        - Further, this is the actual reason Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> is so strong

.
⬥ Greater Barge is commonly used as follows, in the following cases:
    • First is simply at the start of a fight, as you should not have attacked anything long enough and thus can freely Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> and then convert a channeled ability into a DoT
    • Secondly is after any mechanic that forces you to off, such as Vorago's Reflect mechanic, as you again should not have attacked anything long enough allowing you to then Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> freely
    • The third case is stalling your rotation mid-combat before you <:zerk:535532854004678657> to get the effect within it, which is done as follows:

.
**__Exploring How to Execute the Third Case Properly__**
⬥ Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) → click off atleast 1 tick (0.6sec) before your Defensive → Defensive (e.g. <:anti:535541306475151390>) → Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    • It is important to click off atleast 1 tick prior otherwise you will not get the effect
        - This is thought to be because the game thinks you have tried to cast an auto as a result of the Defensive, and so resets the Greater Barge effect timer
    • Also, as seen here, there are 9 ticks (5.4sec) between the the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge, which is 1 more tick (0.6sec) than required
        - So, if said Ability gets you the adrenaline to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, then it is a tick (0.6s) more efficient to do as follows:
⬥ Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) → wait 2 ticks (1.2sec) → Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    • As seen here, there are now 8 ticks (4.8sec) between the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>

.
⬥ Here is a demonstration:
.
https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw
.
**__The Cost of Using Greater Barge__**
⬥ In general the cost of utilizing Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> is an Auto in say your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, but in the third case the cost is a Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) + your Auto
    • Though the benefit is an extra 4 ticks in say your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> which is large enough to be worth said cost

.
**__Notes on Greater Barge__**
*Note: bullets marked with ★ are likely bugs, or at the very least unintended*

⬥ Multiple people can stack their Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> bled abilities, unlike what would be possible with normal bleed abilities

.
⬥ If you bleed Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> all the hits will reduce your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> cooldown, as you allow its full duration to channel now

.
⬥ If you bleed Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> you need to be careful for a couple reasons: ★
    • If you are out of melee distance, it does the equivalent of its AoE (i.e., normal Flurry's) damage, which is far weaker than Greater Flurry's damage per hit
    • Similarly, this occurs if you are adjacent to other targets

.
⬥ If you using queuing, if you have no target, ensure to not queue your Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> before TCing and using it, otherwise you will not get the buff to bleed a channeled ability ★
    • Similar issues occur when clicking over TCing, though likely not a bug, but important to be aware of nonetheless

.
⬥ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> also does not give adrenaline if you still have a target that is dead ★

.
⬥ If for whatever reason you were to bleed Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581>, it only does 180% hits ★

.
⬥ Equipping a different tier of weapon *after* bleeding will change the damage of the weapon according to the latter weapon tier
    • This occurs as it is still attempting to cast each hit separately, like a normal channel
        - This also means each hit has its own chance to hit
    • For example, of you bleed with a t90 weapon equipped, then switch to t92 the damage will be calculated as t92 damage for any remaining hits
    • This has some odd interactions with weapons such as Terassaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> which will be explored momentarily ★

⬥ Vorago will not clear these DoTs on reflect

.
⬥ The hit timings of Greater Barge bleeds follow a fixed pattern:
    • The first hit's hit timing corresponds with the time it would normally hit as a channeled ability
        - For example, 2H Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> hit 1 would be 2t (1.2sec) delayed, whereas DW Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> hit 1 would be 3t (1.8sec) delayed
    • Hits 2-4 will always hit 5t, 7t, and 9t (3sec, 4.2sec, 5.4sec) delayed respectively

.
⬥ Further if you stall a barge bleed the following will occur: ★
    • Hits 2-4 will hit as normal on the target you casted the ability on to stall
    • Hit 1 will be the only hit that gets stalled, and when released will hit the same time as it would normally hit if it were the first hit of its channeled ability
        - Furthermore, what this means is you can far-cast your barge bleed on a target to make hits 2-4 hit it from a large distance technically

.
**__Greater Barge Interation with Weapon Effects__**
⬥ For sake of example, Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and Terassaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> will be used; however, this affects any barge bleed and, as far as is known, is caused by the following weapons as well:
    • Bane Weaponry
    • Keris
    • Darklight

.
⬥ Essentially what happens is that *after* you apply a bleed with one of these weapons, such as a Terassaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, and then you swap weapons, for instance to a T92 weapon (e.g. <:zgs:626465964325601290>), the effect is applied ontop of the t92 weapon's damage for the remaining hits
    • As in, with the Terassaur Maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954> example, if you bleed Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> against a Ranged monster, and then swap to a t92 weapon, for each bleed hit casted with t92 on it will result in t92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5% damage, which is quite a large increase.
        - However, if you bleed with t92, and then swap to the maul <:terramaul:602561894829522954>, it will just do its normal damage without the modifier being applied

> **__Deviating Upgrade Paths__**
.tag:DeviatingUpgradePath
**__Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood__**
*Note: As with any upgrade path, feel free to ask any questions you have in <#656898197561802760>*

⬥ The prioritization of upgrades can vary depending on what your focus is with PvM.
    • This is largely due to the fact the costs of each upgrade is relatively high

.
⬥ Generally speaking it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex first <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.
    • Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds.

.
⬥ Further, it is worth aiming to get Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> as well
    • Largely because it can be nice for utilizing all your Berserk-boosted ticks during you Berserk

.
⬥ That being said, Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> is pretty minor and should be delayed until much later
    • Though it may be nice if you are planning to do a lot of afk-based revolution-using content

.
⬥ Afterwards, if you will benefit from the special attack, it is generally recommended to get a Zaros Godsword <:zgs:626465964325601290>
    • Its extremely powerful special attack greatly improves your sustained DPM.

.
⬥ Alternatively, you could pick up a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> if you can bleed at the encounter you are doing
    • It increases the duration of bleeds, which is a relatively decent DPS increase
    • Further it can be a good weapon to bridge the gap between t90 weaponry and Zaros Godsword, given it is far cheaper

.
⬥ At high defense bosses such as Vorago, Angel of Death, and Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is recommended to pick up a Statius' Warhammer <:swh:641670143197446182>.
    • It has a special attack which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute.
    • It also increases your affinity against said target

.
⬥ In the end you should aim to grab all three of these upgrades.

.
**__Zaros Godsword__**
⬥ The Zaros Godsword <:zgs:626465964325601290> is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'.
    • Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for Melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour <:vigour:615613235512737792>), buffs damage by 25% and lasts for 35 ticks (t0-t34, 21 sec).
    • It should be used in rotation with Berserk (ie. use Blackhole when Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> is on cooldown) OR when the situation is too dangerous to Berserk in.

.
*Note: You do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range.*

⬥ ZGS rotations are similar to Berserk rotations but vary based on the boss.

⬥ As for adrenaline potions, it is recommended to save adrenaline potions for Berserk as it is more valuable in Berserk with its higher damage modifier.

.
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> + Adrenaline Potion <:replenpot:641337470491033600> / Limitless Sigil <:limitless:641339233638023179> → Berserk Cooldown → ZGS Special → ZGS Cooldown → Repeat

.
**__Masterwork Spear of Annihilation__** <:mwspear:694566917456789554>
⬥ A fairly powerful weapon in its own right if you are able to bleed.

.
⬥ Its effect is that it adds two additional hits to the following abilities:
    • Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits, and up to 10 with the Strength Cape effect)
        - Further, because of this, the spear becomes your Lunging <:lunge4:736522494315593759> switch eventually
    • Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)
    • Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)

.
**__Statius' Warhammer__** <:swh:641670143197446182>
⬥ One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability <:ingen:641339234111848463>.

.
⬥ If you intend to do group PvM it is recommended to buy a SWH and use its special attack at high defence bosses (eg. Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast Master, Angel of Death).

.
⬥ Usage of the SWH varies from boss to boss and will be covered more specifically in our boss guides.

.
**__Greater Fury__** <:gfury:535532879334080527>
⬥ Greater Fury can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Fury Ability Codex.

.
⬥ This does a few things things:
    • Firstly, Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> is no longer a 3-hit channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage (the same as the first two hits of the channeled version)
    • Secondly, the passive 5% critical hit chance increase per channelled hit changes to a single 10% critical hit chance increase on the next hit
    • Thirdly, it gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit on Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> gives you a buff which guarantees the first hit of your next ability will crit

.
⬥ The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a 3-hit (5t/3.0s) channeled ability to a 1-hit non-channeled ability, and so it only requires a GCD to fully use.
    • This allows Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> to be used in Revolution++ and Revolution setups without needing to manually cancel the channel after 2 hits.

.
⬥ Due to the guaranteed crit effect, it is possible for <:gfury:535532879334080527> to be stronger (on average) than a 188% ability (<:deci:535532879325822986>/<:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:sever:535532879577612298>)
    • This is only possible when the crit chance of <:gfury:535532879334080527> and the ability damage of the following ability are sufficiently high.
        - Currently, the only cases where these requirements are met are when you are under the effects of an active Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385> (and have Biting perk <:biting4:712073087809617931>), and the ability following <:gfury:535532879334080527> is either a flanked ability or a charged Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.
        - Another niche consideration is when under the effects of Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> (and <:grim:568262896375824385>), there is almost no damage difference between <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:assault:535532853979512842> and 188% → <:assault:535532853979512842>.
    • Without the active effects of <:grim:568262896375824385>, <:gfury:535532879334080527> is basically always weaker than a 188% ability.
        - Despite this, if you are put into a position where you have no 188% abilities available and need to use <:gfury:535532879334080527>, you should consider following it up with a >188% ability to still maximise your damage.
*Note: A sheet comparing <:gfury:535532879334080527> to <:deci:535532879325822986>/<:cleave:535532878616985610>/<:sever:535532879577612298> before various abilities can be found here:

.
**__Greater Flurry__** <:gflurry:535532879283879977>
⬥ Greater Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability Codex.

.
⬥ The effect is as follows:
    • Perform a flurry of blows against your surrounding targets, dealing up to 94% weapon damage per hit over 3.6 seconds
    • If only one target is nearby, up to 157% weapon damage per hit will be dealt instead
    • Additionally if an attack hits any target per swing, the cooldown of Berserk will be reduced by 1.2 seconds each swing
        - It is these last two bullets which make it worthwhile

.
⬥ Once you've unlocked this threshold, it becomes your 3rd best threshold in Berserk.

.
⬥ In addition, its unique effect of reducing Berserk cooldown is very useful in overall Melee rotations.

.
⬥ There are several ways of using GFlurry.
    • You can either cancel it on GCD (ie. 2 hits) for burst damage, or use it for its entire duration for its Berserk reduction effect.
        - Further you can 5t it (3 hit/3 sec), primarily used to align your ticks in Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> after using a full channel like Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> to still use all ticks of your ultimate
    • If you bleed this threshold using gBarge, all bleed hits will contribute towards reducing Berserk's <:zerk:535532854004678657> cooldown.
        - This is used extensively at places like AoD and Solak where players want to Berserk as often as possible through out the fight.

.
**__Remaining Upgrades__**
⬥ At this stage, all important upgrades have been obtained and all that remains is to get inherent DPM boosting upgrades.
    • Following this, a T99 Codex <:pcodex:643166740833894400> for Malevolence <:Malevolence:513190159416557573>, then something like Trimmed Masterwork <:tmwbody:536966366272552960> (which is very useful due to its set effect, which delays damage)
    • Then it is encouraged to start picking up things such as Khopeshes <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858><:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>.

.
> **__Weapon Switch Invention Perks__**
.tag:SwitchPerks
**__Flanking 4__**
⬥ Flanking is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 55.
    • The effect is as follows:
        - Backhand, Impact and Binding Shot no longer stun and have their max increased by 40% and min increased by 8% per rank to targets that are not facing you. Forceful Backhand, Deep Impact and Tight Bindings no longer stun and have their max increased by 30% and min by 6% per rank to targets that are not facing you
        - This goes up to rank 4.

.
⬥ Should the opportunity arise at group bosses flanking can be incredibly powerful.
    • Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> becomes your 2nd most powerful basic inside of Berserk while Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> becomes your 4th best threshold in Berserk.
        - The basic ability Backhand should be used as often as possible and the threshold Forceful Backhand should be used either in Berserk or in-between Berserk cooldowns.

.
**__Example Rotations with Flanking__**
⬥ 2h Camping
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210> → Forceful Backhand-Flanking <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → Repeat

.
⬥ DW Camping
Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> → Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> → Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> → Forceful Backhand-Flanking <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> → Repeat

.
*Note: For DW, once you have Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> unlocked it should be used as your 3rd threshold inside Berserk. Flanking would be downgraded to a threshold used in-between Berserk cooldowns.*

.
⬥ This perk should be placed on a Dual Wield Off-hand switch and upgraded to your highest tier available (Drygore <:drygorelongmh:513190158900658180> t90 or dyed-Khopesh <:barrowskhopeshmh:580176857144492042> t92).

.
⬥ Example bosses to bring flanking to include: Vorago <:vorago:572867742613635082>, Angel of Death <:aod:580167371365548042>, group ED1-3 <:Seiryu:583430543321071626> <:BSD:583430542326759435> <:Ambassador:583430542809235458>, Solak <:solak:580167371310891029>, and any other group bossing.

.
**__Lunging 4__**
⬥ Lunging is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 89.
    • The effect is as follows:
        - The maximum damage of Combust, Dismember and Fragmentation shot is incrased by 20% weapon damage per rank, but enemies that move will only take 1.5x increased damage.         - This goes up to rank 4.

.
⬥ The only basic bleed in melee affected by Lunging is Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>.
    • Since Dismember cannot be walked to gain bonus damage, the effects of Lunging will always activate for Dismember, thus it is **strictly** an upgrade over non-lunging Dismember.
    • In fact, the effect of Lunging is extra strong on Dismember *because* Dismember cannot be walked (the same applies to the 99 Strength Cape effect).
        - With Lunging 4 and Strength Cape effect combined, Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> becomes the **strongest basic ability** for melee outside of Berserk.

.
⬥ Dismember should be used outside Berserk as bleeds do not get boosted damage (Dismember has a 15s cooldown so you should plan to use Dismember before a Berserk, then 20s later, use Dismember after a Berserk).

⬥ The goal is to have near 100% uptime of the Dismember effect when using Lunging4 + Strength Cape.

⬥ A Dual Wield Off-hand switch should be used for this perk and later upgraded to a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation <:masterworkspearofannihilation:694566917456789554> due to it further extending the duration of Dismember.

.
> **__Auto Attacks__**
.tag:AutoAttacks
**__What They are and When to Use Them__**
⬥ Once you've incorporated DW/2h Switching, auto attacks become more prevelant as a dps tool.

⬥ When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: Fastest (e.g. drygore mainhand <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902>) = 4t, Average (e.g. <:zgs:626465964325601290>) = 6t.
    • Each time you do a Damaging Ability, it resets this cooldown.

.
⬥ We will be using 2H auto attacks as they deal more damage.

.
⬥ There are two specific instances of when you want to incorporate auto attacks into your rotation; one is 'passive', the other will is 5taa.

.
**__'Passive' Auto Attacks__**
⬥ By performing a non-damaging ability, the auto attack cooldown is not reset, yet a GCD is 3t.

⬥ So, during the GCD, assuming the ability before was non-channeled and cast with either Fast or Fastest speed weapons you will get an auto attack during your GCD.
    • This is because the respective cooldowns are 5t (3 sec) and 4t (2.4 sec), yet the GCD of the ability prior to the non-damaging ability will cover the first 3t of the cooldown, so the cooldown will end during the GCD caused by the non-damaging ability
        - Further, you will have to click the boss if you somehow "offed" (e.g., by clicking under you) from it to get the auto

.
⬥ Auto attacks can deal up to 5k damage, 8k in a Berserk and in most cases is worth the 2t wait.

.
⬥ You can perform an auto attack on every Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> activation by doing the following:
Fast/Fastest weapon speed non-channeled ability → Berserk → Swap to 2H → Click target if you offed + (Auto Attack) → Continue with Zerk rotation

*Note: this section is called "passive" auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. Though, it is not technically "loseless."*

.
**__5TAA__**
⬥ Auto attacks can be used "actively" in what's known as 5taa.

⬥ Similar to mage, the idea is to use a 2H auto attack every other ability, in a pattern of:
Auto Attack → Ability1 → Ability2 → Repeat.
    • However, you DO NOT weave them in as regularly as 4TAA autos with Magic
.
https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0
.
⬥ Ability2 must be a Fastest weapon-speed casted ability, and must not be a channeled ability.

⬥ Input Ability1 as soon as you see the sword swing animation from the Auto attack.
    • Timing will take practice.
    • The only restriction on what the Ability one can be is a less than slower than Fastest weapon-speed channeled ability

.
⬥ Here is a video by <@162317885044293632> going more in depth of 5TAA and when you would use it, and why you would use it:
.
https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ
.
**__Major Downsides of 5TAA to Consider:__**
⬥ Slower adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 3% adrenaline.
    • Since you are doing an auto every other ability, coupled with standing idle for 2 ticks every other ability, you gain adrenaline at a much slower pace than with traditional rotations.

⬥ There is no button to force melee auto attacks.
    • This means you have to stand idle for 1 ticks after Ability2 and *wait* for the auto attack to come out, and then wait 1 additional tick afterwards before inputting your next ability (thus overall there being a 2t delay between Ability2 and the ability after).
    • Proper timing will require practice.
        - Input an ability too fast and you lose the Auto attack.
        - Input an ability too slow and you lose DPS.

.
⬥ These two reasons are why 5taa is a situational technique, though it is still worth mentioning.

.
> **__Choosing a Drygore__**
.tag:dryg
**__Ideal Choice__**
⬥ It is recommended to use a Drygore Mace and either a Off-hand Drygore Longsword or Off-hand Drygore Rapier.

*Note: All Drygores have tier 90 ability damage, and if only using abilities, the choice of Drygores would make no difference.*

.
**__Reasoning__**
⬥ If considering auto attacks, maces have the fastest attack speed, and a lower auto attack damage, whereas longswords and rapiers have a slower attack speed for a slightly higher auto attack damage.
    • The above combination of Drygores is optimal because you should never need mainhand autos, as 2h autos are always preferable, and the faster attack speeds allows for 5 tick auto attacking.
        - However, when making use of freedom autos, then off-hand attack speed is considered.
