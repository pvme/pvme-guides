⬥ In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

**__Ability Prioritization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns.
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again – during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities.

⬥ To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities'.
    • For Melee these are just strong basics with short cooldowns, which will be used between your other high damaging but longer cooldowned abilities in order to pace your cooldowns.

*Note: You will have to use weak abilities like Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> as a filler ability should you be weapon camping*

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum):

.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind.

⬥ You want to make sure to prioritize usage of Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and Destroy / Cane <:destroy:535532879330148352> / <:cane:535532878969438210> as these are your strongest thresholds, where ideally they are used your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and generally the first couple thresholds you use.
    • Also, if cooldowns and adrenaline permit outside of <:zerk:535532854004678657> they are of high priority too, such as using them in <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • Outside of <:zerk:535532854004678657>, especially the Masterwork Spear of Annilihation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> you would want to prioritize bleed thresholds such as Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> too.

⬥ Blood Tendrils has 45s cd so you can only use it once per zerk cycle (i.e., per 1 minute cycle)
    • This means you have a great deal of flexibility with when you use it so should balance it around maximising other thresholds
        - This is not to say that you should ignore Blood Tendril usage, it is just to say you have greater flexibility of when to slot it into your rotation

.
⬥ There are certain thresholds that your focus should be cooldown management
    • These include Slaughter, Assault, and sometimes Cane/Destroy
        - These are your strongest thresholds, but also have the tightest cooldowns in terms of maximizing usage/minute
    • In contrast, there are abilities that would not define your ability rotation as strictly such as Cleave, which is what is considered filler in between these

⬥ Filler abilities such as Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> should be used in-between other high damage but longer cooldowned ability such as Sever <:sever:535532879577612298>, Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>, and flank Backhand <:backhandflank:867678153854025779>

⬥ Any basic ability with equal-or-lower damage than 2-hit Fury / Greater Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> would be considered a weak ability (Barge <:barge:535532853916860437>, Smash <:smash:535532879820619786>, Havoc <:havoc:535532879300526080>, Slice <:slice:535532879594258432>, and Punish <:punish:535532879439069184>).
    • Generally speaking, these should be avoided.
        - There are cases and conditions where <:gfury:535532879334080527> is on average better than what are referred to as 188 abilities (<:sever:535532879577612298> / <:cleave:535532878616985610> / <:deci:535532879325822986>), this will be discussed later.
    • If you are DW or 2H camping you will likely have to regularly weave in (2-hit) <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> more often as your weakest ability.

.
⬥ If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one strong filler ability (Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> or Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> or Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> as often as possible in your rotation.
    • <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> becomes another one of your filler abilities, albeit it is weaker than what is typically a melee filler ability
        - A basic pattern of (2-hit) <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> as your filler abilities.
    • This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> → Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> → Ability → Ability → Repeat will work.

> **__When to Cancel Channels__**
.tag:cancel
**__Desired Channel Lengths__**
⬥ In almost all scenarios, you will cancel Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

⬥ Typically you will cancel your Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • To cancel on 3rd hit you would cancel on t5 (3s)
    • To cancel on 2nd hit you would cancel on t3 (1.8s)
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Flurry <:flurry:864492981763702834>, Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, and Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581>

.
**__2H vs Dual Wield Assault__**
⬥ Assault hit splats will land at different times depending on whether it is cast with 2h or DW.
    • The timing to cancel it remains unchanged.
```
Assuming a T0 Assault cast, it hits on ticks:
2 4 6 8 for 2H
3 5 7 9 for DW
```

**__When to Cancel Greater Flurry__**
Unlike other Melee channels, <:gflurry:535532879283879977> sees regular use of both 2-hit and 3-hit versions of itself, as well as some cases for 4-hitting it, this section will give a general idea of when each is used:

⬥ **__2-hit__**
    • No Relentless <:relentless5:712244800920748092> Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> Berserks <:zerk:535532854004678657>
        - E.g.: Bled <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:assault:535532855191928842> → (2-hit) <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → Basic → <:destroy:535532879330148352>

⬥ **__3-hit__**
    • General Apot <:adrenrenewal:736298121704767538> Berserks <:zerk:535532854004678657> (where only 1 7t channel is used)
        - This is done to realign ticks so you can get an ability on the last tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657>
    • Relentless <:relentless5:712244800920748092> Limitless <:limitless:641339233638023179> Berserks <:zerk:535532854004678657>
        - E.g.: Bled <:limitless:641339233638023179> <:assault:535532855191928842> → (3-hit) <:gflurry:535532879283879977> → <:destroy:535532879330148352>, where the <:relentless5:712244800920748092> proc is on <:assault:535532855191928842> or <:gflurry:535532879283879977>

⬥ **__4-hit__**
    • When Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> cooldown is important
    • If your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> will not end so the tick offset is not an issue

> **__Dual Wield vs 2H Camp__**
.tag:2hvsDW
This section is meant to list the benefits of camping one over the other though it is strongly recommended to just juggle, as it gives access to all the following benefits, and more.

.
**__2H Benefits__** <:noxscythe:513190159341322240>
⬥ Better AoE capabilities
    • This due to access to Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610>, Hurricane <:cane:535532878969438210>, and Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>

.
**__Dual Wield Camp Benefits__** <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>
⬥ Easier swapping
    • You can swap to Shield <:malevkite:513190159412625411> or Flanks <:flankicon:841419289755385866> more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap

*Note: The reason why offhand swaps are used can be read by doing !ohswitches in <#534563158304620564>*

.
> **__Switches__**
.tag:switches
This section will detail several switches that are useful for magic, and should be incorporated as comfortable and when relevant.

.
**__Juggling__** <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> / <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>
⬥ This is simply referring to either adding a Dual Wield swap or 2H swap depending on if you currently 2H camp or Dual Wield Camp.

⬥ This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> or Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> respectively.
    • Thus, it gives you a new filler ability to make use of and so you can manage cooldowns more effectively and also increase your average damage overall.
    • Moreover, it gives you all the benefits that 2H camping and Dual Wield camping alone provides.
    • Furthermore, you are now able to get lossless 2H autos with non-damaging abilities (i.e., defensive autos) such as <:zerk:535532854004678657> and <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>

.
**__Flanking__** <:flankicon:841419289755385866>
⬥ This is a simple, yet strongly recommend switch to incorporate, especially for those doing group-based content.

⬥ This turns Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> and Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant
    • It increases Minimum of <:backhand:535532854302605333> by 8% per Flanking rank and its Max by 40% per Flanking rank
    • It increases Minimum of <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> by 6% per Flanking rank and its Max by 30% per Flanking rank

⬥ It is recommended to put this perk on an off-hand switch
    • Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Khopesh MH <:khopeshmh:513206794844110858> + Drygore OH <:drygorelongoh:852939843767369783> > Drygore MH <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> + Khopesh OH <:khopeshoh:513206794752098327>)

.
**__Masterwork Spear of Annilihation__** <:mwspear:694566917456789554>
⬥ Its effect is that it adds two additional hits to the following abilities:
    • Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits, and up to 10 with the Strength Cape <:strcape:689503815296352308> effect)
    • Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)
    • Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)

⬥ While this weapon could used as your primary t92 2H weapon, it is better to use it as a switch for the above 3 abilities as you can perk it to have <:lunge4:736522494315593759> to boost <:dismember:535532879376023572> damage and getting full benefit of normal DPS perks on your remaining abilities.

.
> **__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:defAutos
*Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as "Defensive Autos", it is more technical to say they are non-damaging abilities, and so includes things like Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and the Zaros Godsword spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>.*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Typically, when you cast an auto or ability it put your Auto on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with
    • Cooldowns for various weapon speeds are as follows:
```
Speed (cooldown in ticks/seconds)
Slowest (12t/7.2s)
Average (6t/3.6s)
Fast (5t/3.0s)
Fastest (4t/2.4s)
```
*Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., "Average Ability") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it*

⬥ Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you cast one it will not put your auto on cooldown

.
**__What This Means__**
⬥ If you cast a fast/fastest ability into a defensive ability, your auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • For Melee this will just be your default auto, though you can alter it to a debuff spell like <:ent:567727987274022924> still by doing <:ent:567727987274022924> → Defensive
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
.
```
T0: Fast/Fastest Ability
T3: Defensive
T4/5: Auto is cast
T6: Ability
```
⬥ Video Demonstration (Courtesy of <@184952892422094848>):
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:cleave:535532878616985610>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/hlw4KFW.mp4
.
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H auto, as the cooldown for any auto ends on t4
        - So, you would simply swap to a 2H weapon between the Fast/Fastest Ability cast to before the Auto would be cast

.
**__Freedom__**
It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2H auto
⬥ You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by doing auto → <:freedom:535541258240786434> on the same tick.
    • To do this with Melee you will need an off-hand magic weapon on (e.g., Ancient Lantern <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781>), and to have an offhand autocast spell set (Polypore Strike <:polyporestrike:859483781487394826> recommended)
⬥ An example of getting both offhand and 2H auto can be seen in this clip by <@425520655920791553>: <https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8>
    • It is important to stress that you should not swap to 2H too early, otherwise you will lose the offhand auto. You should swap 1t after you cast <:freedom:535541258240786434>

> **__Greater Barge__** <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
.tag:Gbarge
**__The Basics__**
Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> can be unlocked by consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex.

.
Greater Barge works as follows:
⬥ It will break you free of binds, and where applicable bind a target for 11 ticks (6.6sec)

⬥ By default has a damage range of 25%-125%

⬥ For each tick (0.6sec) since the player stopped attacking their target, Greater Barge gains +10% to its max damage range, and +2% to its min
    • This caps at 10 tick (6s) for +100% and +20%, for a final range of 45%-225%

⬥ If it has been atleast 8 ticks (4.8sec) since you stopped attacking it gains another effect, indicated by the Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> icon appearing on your Buff Bar, then it gains an additional effect:
    • Any melee channeled ability used within 10 ticks (6sec) of casting Greater Barge, indicated by the a Provoke-like <:voke:535541259465392143> icon appearing on your Buff Bar, will be turned into a damage-over-time (DoT) instead
        - For the sake of simplicity converting a channeled ability into a DoT is referred to as "bleeding" it, or having "bled" it, or you are going to "bleed" that threshold; however, these should not be confused with normal bleeds (e.g. <:dismember:535532879376023572>), as they are different.
    • Further, this is the actual reason Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> is so strong

.
**__When It Is Used__**
Greater Barge is commonly used as follows, in the following cases:
⬥ First is simply at the start of a fight, as you should not have attacked anything long enough and thus can freely Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> and then convert a channeled ability into a DoT

⬥ Secondly is after any mechanic that forces you to off, such as Vorago's Reflect mechanic, as you again should not have attacked anything long enough allowing you to then Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> freely

⬥ The third case is stalling your rotation mid-combat before you <:zerk:535532854004678657> to get the effect within it, which is done as follows:

.
**__Exploring How to Execute the Third Case Properly__**
⬥ Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) → click off atleast 1 tick (0.6sec) before your Defensive → Defensive (e.g. <:anti:535541306475151390>) → Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    • It is important to click off atleast 1 tick prior otherwise you will not get the effect
        - This is thought to be because the game thinks you have tried to cast an auto as a result of the Defensive, and so resets the Greater Barge effect timer
    • Also, as seen here, there are 9 ticks (5.4sec) between the the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge, which is 1 more tick (0.6sec) than required
        - So, if said Ability gets you the adrenaline to Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, then it is a tick (0.6s) more efficient to do as follows:

⬥ Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) → wait 2 ticks (1.2sec) → Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> → Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    • As seen here, there are now 8 ticks (4.8sec) between the Damaging Ability and Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>

.
⬥ Here is a demonstration:
.
https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw
.
**__The Cost of Using Greater Barge__**
In general the cost of utilizing Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> is an Auto in say your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, but in the third case the cost is a Damaging Ability (e.g. <:deci:535532879325822986>) + your Auto.

Though the benefit is an extra 4 ticks in say your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> which is large enough to be worth said cost.

.
**__Notes on Greater Barge__**
*Note: bullets marked with ★ are likely bugs, or at the very least unintended*

⬥ Unlike normal non-damaging abilities, while ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> will not incur the auto cooldown, it will still try to drag you in to auto
    • Therefore, if you want to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> mid combat, you need to click off again as you <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> to not auto and lose the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> buff

⬥ Multiple people can stack their Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> bled abilities, unlike what would be possible with normal bleed abilities

.
⬥ If you bleed Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> all the hits will reduce your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> cooldown, as you allow its full duration to channel now

.
⬥ ★ If you using queuing, if you have no target, ensure to not queue your Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> before TCing and using it, otherwise you will not get the buff to bleed a channeled ability
    • Similar issues occur when clicking over TCing, though likely not a bug, but important to be aware of nonetheless

⬥ ★ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> also does not give adrenaline if you still have a target that is dead

.
⬥ ★ If for whatever reason you were to bleed Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581>, it only does 180% hits

⬥ Equipping a different tier of weapon *after* bleeding will change the damage of the weapon according to the latter weapon tier
    • This occurs as it is still attempting to cast each hit separately, like a normal channel
        - This also means each hit has its own chance to hit
    • For example, of you bleed with a t90 weapon equipped, then switch to t92 the damage will be calculated as t92 damage for any remaining hits

⬥ Vorago will not clear these DoTs on reflect

.
⬥ The hit timings of Greater Barge bleeds follow a fixed pattern:
    • The first hit's hit timing corresponds with the time it would normally hit as a channeled ability
        - For example, 2H Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> hit 1 would be 2t (1.2sec) delayed, whereas DW Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> hit 1 would be 3t (1.8sec) delayed
    • Hits 2-4 will always hit 5t, 7t, and 9t (3sec, 4.2sec, 5.4sec) delayed respectively

⬥ ★ Further if you stall a barge bleed the following will occur:
    • Hits 2-4 will hit as normal on the target you casted the ability on to stall
    • Hit 1 will be the only hit that gets stalled, and when released will hit the same time as it would normally hit if it were the first hit of its channeled ability
        - Furthermore, what this means is you can far-cast your barge bleed on a target to make hits 2-4 hit it from a large distance technically

This does a few things things:
⬥ Firstly, Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> is no longer a 3-hit channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage (the same as the first two hits of the channeled version)

⬥ Secondly, the passive 5% critical hit chance increase per channelled hit changes to a single 10% critical hit chance increase on the next hit

.
⬥ Thirdly, it gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit on Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> gives you a buff which guarantees the first hit of your next ability will crit

⬥ The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a 3-hit (5t/3.0s) channeled ability to a 1-hit non-channeled ability, and so it only requires a GCD to fully use.
    • This allows Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> to be used in Revolution++ and Revolution setups without needing to manually cancel the channel after 2 hits.

.
⬥ Due to the guaranteed crit effect, it is possible for <:gfury:535532879334080527> to be stronger (on average) than a 188% ability (<:deci:535532879325822986> / <:cleave:535532878616985610> / <:sever:535532879577612298>)
    • This is only possible when the crit chance of <:gfury:535532879334080527> and the ability damage of the following ability are sufficiently high.
        - Currently, the only cases where these requirements are met are when you are under the effects of an active Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385> (and have Biting perk <:biting4:712073087809617931>), and the ability following <:gfury:535532879334080527> is either a flanked ability or a charged Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.
        - Another niche consideration is when under the effects of Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> (and <:grim:568262896375824385>), there is almost no damage difference between <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:assault:535532853979512842> and 188% → <:assault:535532853979512842>.
    • Without the active effects of <:grim:568262896375824385>, <:gfury:535532879334080527> is basically always weaker than a 188% ability.
        - Despite this, if you are put into a position where you have no 188% abilities available and need to use <:gfury:535532879334080527>, you should consider following it up with a >188% ability to still maximise your damage.

> **__Choosing a Drygore__**
.tag:drygore
*Note: 99% of the time it will be MH Mace, OH Non-Mace <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902> <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>, this section just goes in more depth of varying scenarios*

.
**__Disclaimer__**
It is important to initially make clear that ***all*** Drygore weaponry does the same ability damage, and the differences in choices occur due to other properties they have, such as side-effects due to their weapon speeds.

.
**__Weapon Camping__**
Assuming you camp dual-wield, then it largely does not matter - though you should ideally pick up a MH Non-Mace <:drygorelongmh:513190158900658180> due to higher auto damage, which you will make use of as you Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> assuming you are not going to use Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578>.

.
**__Weapon Juggling__**
When it comes to juggling (i.e., making use of both 2H and dual-wield weaponry), the choice is a bit more important:
⬥ You want a MH Mace <:augdrygoremacemh:697485495684431902>, due to its fastest weapon speed:
    • This allows you to 5-tick Auto Attack (5TAA) if need be.
        - This also means you can 4-tick Auto Attack (4TAA) debuff spells such as Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> too.

⬥ You also want an OH non-Mace <:augdrygorerapieroh:697485495718117536>, due to its fast weapon speed:
    • This results in your offhand auto damage in being a bit higher, which only sees use when you Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434>.

.
**__Other Considerations__**
There are cases where you may want to choose a mainhand based on being able to exploit weaknesses (e.g., Drygore Rapier for the Rex Matriarch Rathis), but these are more niche, the above is more general.

.
> **__5TAA__**
.tag:5TAA
*Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., "Average Ability") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it*

.
**__What It is__**
⬥ This is pretty similar to 4TAA, but for Melee, in that you are essentially delaying your next ability to get an auto in; however, a key difference is that Melee does not have an auto bind, and so must wait an additonal tick before casting their ability

.
⬥ So, instead of doing:
```
T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T4: Auto + Ability
```
⬥ You do
```
T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T4: Auto auto-casts
T5: Ability
```
⬥ Video Demonstration (Courtesy of <@184952892422094848>):
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:sever:535532879577612298> → (wait 4t) auto fires → (wait 1t) <:cleave:535532878616985610>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1KJ1v9d.mp4
.
⬥ The reason for this is because Autos normally are executed after abilities in a tick, so using an ability on the same tick it is casted will override it as it incurs the auto cooldown, hence the need to delay the ability an additional tick to get the auto in

.
**__5TAA with revolution__**
⬥ With Revolution active, after casting a fastest non-channeled ability, you will have to use Cease <:cease:864235458464186418> (or off by other means) before Revolution triggers your next ability. Then, click on your target 4t after your initial ability casted, which is 1t after the GCD ends (i.e., when your ability bar flashes), to force an auto attack. Follow it up with your next ability 1t after the auto.

⬥ Video Demonstration:
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:deci:535532879325822986> + <:cease:864235458464186418> → (wait 4t) click on target → (wait 1t) <:sever:535532879577612298>

**__When It is Used__**
⬥ 5TAA is primarily done to align ticks, this is most notably seen in Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotations that use one 7t channel (e.g., 4-hit Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>) without the ability to use a 5t channel (e.g., 3-hit Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>) to align ticks, as can be seen below:
```
T0: Zerk
T3: Ability
T6: Ability
T9: 7t channeled Ability
T16: Ability
T19: Ability
T22: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T26: Auto auto-casts
T27: Ability
T30: Ability
T33: Ability + Zerk ends
```
.
⬥  As you can see in the above table, by using a 5TAA it was possible to get an ability on the last tick of <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, this then allows any ability to hit outside of <:Berserk:513190158468907012> and thus get both <:Berserk:513190158468907012> and Berserker Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> damage modifiers
*Note: You can read more on this interaction in <#689206023675838471>*

⬥ It is important to note that the ability before must be a fastest non-channeled ability or your auto will be on cooldown
    • Further the ability before that cannot be a slower-than-fastest channeled ability otherwise your auto would still be on cooldown

**__Difference in the Above Clips__**
As seen, they both follow the same ability order, except the first has an auto, and the other has a non-boosted Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> after Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>

⬥ In the clip where 5TAA is used, <:quake:535532879506309150> does more damage (8451 vs 7644)

⬥ This is because by making using of 5TAA it was possible to realign the Zerk rotation to get an ability on the last tick of <:Berserk:513190158468907012> to get the Ultimate <:Berserk:513190158468907012> and Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> buff
    • Doing a 7t (4.2s) channel will require you to do this to realign to last tick of <:Berserk:513190158468907012>
        - An alternate way to realign is to use a 5t (3.0s) channel

⬥ The <:deci:535532879325822986> after the <:quake:535532879506309150> was used to display how you cannot fit another ability by skipping the auto anyway, so to make full use of <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ticks you want to 5TAA
    • The benefits of this is gone in more in depth in this video by <@162317885044293632>: <https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ>

> **__Applying Smoke Cloud__**
.tag:smoke
**__How to Apply It__**
There are two ways to go about applying Smoke Cloud with Melee:

⬥ **Using Freedom** <:freedom:535541258240786434>
    • Replacing the offhand <:freedom:535541258240786434> auto for Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> by doing <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - It is worth noting this requires an offhand autocast spell like Polypore Strike <:polyporestrike:859483781487394826> to be set beforehand, as well as an offhand Magic weapon being equipped

.
⬥ **4-ticking it**
    • Similar to doing 5TAA, except you will do <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + Ability on the 4th tick, instead of doing an ability on the 5th tick
        - 4th/5th tick are in relation to the ability before it being on tick 0
    • This costs an additional tick compared to using <:freedom:535541258240786434>. So, if done in Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, it is important to be wary of the following to ensure you realign back to final tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657>:
        - If a 7t channel is done in <:zerk:535532854004678657> then you will have to do another 7t channel, or somehow drop a tick somewhere (e.g., <:zerk:535532854004678657> 1t earlier before a fight starts)
        - If a 7t channel is not done then you will have to 5TAA or do a 5t channel

.
**__Issues with Melee Using Smoke Cloud__**
While it is still worth applying, Melee struggles the most with applying the spell due to having a shorter ultimate than the other styles, as well as the fact that with Greater Barge you cannot just use Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> as you start the fight, it would have to be casted mid-Zerk after your Barge.

.tag:zerkRots
**__Notes__**
⬥ These are NOT boss rotations, so it may be worse to do at times, but these rotations are a solid general rotation to go off of

⬥ Smoke cloud is not included in the damage numbers and also not included in the rotations themselves (with exception of the Smoke Cloud Zerk where it is applied, but damage is not included)
    • Melee is by far the worst style for actually applying smoke cloud.

⬥ All numbers assume maxed gear (as of 22/07/2021)
    • Also assumes Zerk Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290>, Grim <:grim:568262896375824385>, Reavers <:reaverring:839903943018283050>, and standard YARB settings
        - YARB: <https://ryyhen.github.io/yarb>

⬥ Assumes no Relentless <:relentless5:712244800920748092> procs and minimal Impatient <:imp4:712073088204013640> procs

⬥ These rotations do not loop 100% perfectly, though it should be easy to adapt if longer duration rotations are required
