 **__Introduction__**
.tag:Intro
⬥ Melee is a style designed around big bursts and damage over time. It tries to balance high hitting abilities in Berserk and bleeding outside of it.

**__Ability Prioritisation__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritised and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns.
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again – during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities.

⬥ To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities'.
    • For Melee these are just strong basics with short cooldowns, which will be used between your other high damaging but longer cooldowned abilities in order to pace your cooldowns.]

*Note: You will have to use weak abilities like Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> as a filler ability should you be weapon camping*

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritised based on damage (in a vacuum):

.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritisations AND cooldowns should be on your mind.

⬥ You want to make sure to prioritise usage of Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>, Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>, and Cane <:cane:535532878969438210> as these are your strongest thresholds, where ideally they are used in your <:Berserk:513190158468907012> zerk and generally the first couple thresholds you use.
    • Outside of <:zerk:535532854004678657>, especially with the Masterwork Spear of Annilihation <:mwspear:694566917456789554> you would want to prioritise bleed thresholds such as Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> and Blood Tendrils <:BloodTend:513190158431158274>, too.

.
⬥ There are certain thresholds that your focus should be cooldown management
    • These include <:slaughter:535532879237873666>, <:assault:535532853979512842>, and sometimes <:cane:535532878969438210> / <:destroy:535532879330148352>
        - These are your strongest thresholds, but also have the tightest cooldowns in terms of maximising usage/minute
    • In contrast, there are abilities that would not define your ability rotation as strictly such as Cleave, which is what is considered filler in between these

⬥ Filler abilities such as Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> should be used in-between other high damage but longer cooldowned ability such as Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>, and flank Backhand <:backhandflank:867678153854025779>

⬥ Any basic ability with equal-or-lower damage than 2-hit Fury / Greater Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> would be considered a weak ability (Barge <:barge:535532853916860437>, Smash <:smash:535532879820619786>, Havoc <:havoc:535532879300526080>, Slice <:slice:535532879594258432>, and Punish <:punish:535532879439069184>).
    • Generally speaking, these should be avoided.
        - There are cases and conditions where <:gfury:535532879334080527> is on average better than what are referred to as 188 abilities (<:sever:535532879577612298> / <:cleave:535532878616985610> / <:deci:535532879325822986>), this will be discussed later.
    • If you are DW or 2H camping you will likely have to regularly weave in (2-hit) <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> more often as your weakest ability.

.
⬥ If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one strong filler ability (Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> or Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986>, respectively). Thus, try to utilise Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> or Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> as often as possible in your rotation.
    • <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> becomes another one of your filler abilities, albeit it is weaker than what is typically a melee filler ability
        - A basic pattern of (2-hit) <:fury:535532879510372352> / <:gfury:535532879334080527> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Cleave <:cleave:535532878616985610> and Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> as your filler abilities.
    • This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.

⬥ Used interchangibly with the term "damage over time (DoT)"
    • The distinction between these is important for melee:
        - A DoT does its damage in multiple hits (e.g. Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572>)
        - A bleed is a subsection of DoTs

**__Using Abyssal Scourge__**
⬥ It is currently the BIS mainhand weapon
    • The T95 leng MH <:lengmh:883134308146098227> should be used as a main weapon in the following scenarios:
        - Accuracy is important
        - The phases are too short to stack Parasite stacks
        - You are hybridding
    • Only require 3 hits of the Parasites before a T93 (<:abyssalscourge:947871842469834832> + <:lengoh:883134308070604870>) ability has outdamaged a T95 (<:lengmh:883134308146098227> + <:lengoh:883134308070604870>) ability

> **__When to Cancel Channels__**
.tag:cancel
**__Desired Channel Lengths__**
⬥ You will always cancel Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s)

⬥ Typically you will cancel your Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> and Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s)
    • To cancel on 3rd hit you would cancel on t5 (3s)
    • To cancel on 2nd hit you would cancel on t3 (1.8s)
        - The above cancel timings are the same for Flurry <:flurry:864492981763702834>, Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>, and Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581>

⬥ When you want to cancel <:gflurry:535532879283879977> differs according to the following
    • If ult cooldown is important you should 4 hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977>
    • If the cooldown is not important you should do as many hits as you need to properly realign your rotation to get an ability on the last tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657>

**__How Greater Barge Works__** <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
⬥ Breaks you free of binds, and where applicable bind a target for 11 ticks (6.6sec)
⬥ For each tick (0.6sec) since the player stopped attacking their target, Greater Barge gains +10% to its max damage range, and +2% to its min
    • This caps at 10 tick (6s) for +100% and +20%, for a final range of 45%-225%

⬥ If it has been atleast 8 ticks (4.8sec) since you stopped attacking it gains another effect:
    • This is indicated by the Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> icon appearing on your Buff Bar
    • Any melee channeled ability used within 10 ticks (6sec) of casting <:gbarge:535532879250456578>, indicated by the <:voke:535541259465392143> icon appearing on your Buff Bar, will be turned into a damage-over-time (DoT) instead
        - Converted channels are typically called barge "bleeds"; however, these should not be confused with normal bleeds (e.g. <:dismember:535532879376023572>) as they are different.
    • This is the reason Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> is so strong

.
**__When Greater Barge Is Used__** <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
⬥ At the start of a fight
⬥ After any mechanic that forces you to not attack (e.g. Vorago's reflect)
⬥ During a <:zerk:535532854004678657> mid-combat

.
**__Using Greater Barge Mid-Combat__**
1) Ability → click away → Defensive → <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    a) It is important to click off atleast 1 tick prior otherwise you will not get the effect

2) Ability → wait 2 ticks → <:zerk:535532854004678657> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578>
    a) Doing it this way saves 1 tick (8 ticks vs 9 ticks)

**__Notes on Greater Barge__**
*Note: bullets marked with ★ are likely unintended / bugs*

⬥ Unlike normal non-damaging abilities, ZGS spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> will try to drag you in to auto
    • Therefore, if you want to <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:gbarge:535532879250456578> mid combat, you need to click off again as you <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028> to not auto and lose the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> buff

⬥ Greater Barge channels DoTs can stack

.
⬥ If you bleed Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977> all the hits will reduce your Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> cooldown

.
⬥ ★ If you use queuing and have no target, ensure to not queue your Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> before TCing and using it, otherwise you will not get the <:gbarge:535532879250456578> buff
    • Similar issues occur when clicking over TCing

⬥ ★ Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> also does not give adrenaline if you still have a target that is dead

.
⬥ ★ Bleed Frenzy <:frenzy:535532879279554581> only does 180% hits

⬥ Equipping a different tier of weapon *after* bleeding will change the damage of the weapon according to the latter weapon tier
    • For example, if you bleed with a t90 weapon equipped then switch to t92, the damage will be calculated as t92 damage for any remaining hits

⬥ Each hit has its own chance to hit

⬥ ★ If you stall a barge bleed the following will occur:
    • Hits 2-4 will hit as normal on the target you casted the ability on to stall
    • Hit 1 will be the only hit that gets stalled, and when released will hit the same time as it would normally hit if it were the first hit of its channeled ability
        - This also means is you can far-cast your barge bleed on a target to make hits 2-4 hit it from a large distance

**__What Greater Fury Does__** <:gfury:535532879334080527>
.tag:Gfury
*Note: due to regular's fury interaction with the Abyssal Scourge and <:gfury:535532879334080527>'s need to use <:grim:568262896375824385>, <:gfury:535532879334080527> is generally considered a downgrade.*

.
⬥ Greater Fury :<:gfury:535532879334080527> hits once dealing 157% ability damage

⬥ The next ability cast after Greater Fury has an added 10% chance to critically strike
    • This is lost upon swapping mainhands
.
⬥ If Greater Fury <:gfury:535532879334080527> crits, it guarantees the first hit of the next ability crits

⬥ The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a 3-hit (5t/3.0s) channeled ability to a 1-hit non-channeled ability
    • This makes <:gfury:535532879334080527> more friendly in Revolution++ and Revolution setups
.
⬥ Due to the guaranteed crit effect, it is possible for <:gfury:535532879334080527> to be stronger (on average) than a 188% ability (<:deci:535532879325822986> / <:cleave:535532878616985610> / <:sever:535532879577612298>)
    • This is when the crit chance of <:gfury:535532879334080527> and the ability damage of the following ability are sufficiently high.
        - Currently some successful Greater Fury complements, under an active Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385> and Biting perk <:biting4:712073087809617931>, are flanking abilities, charged Greater Barge <:gbarge:535532879250456578> or Igneous Overpower.
        - Another niche consideration is when under the effects of Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> (and <:grim:568262896375824385>), there is almost no damage difference between <:gfury:535532879334080527> → <:assault:535532853979512842> and 188% → <:assault:535532853979512842>.

**__2H swap__**
⬥ Using a 2H weapon you can use <:cleave:535532878616985610> as a filler ability as well as <:quake:535532879506309150> or <:cane:535532878969438210> (if no lengs) as thresholds
⬥ The tier of the 2H does not matter if stalling abilities with it and then releasing with dual wield

.
**__Gloves of Passage__** <:Glovesofpassage:556588694862037012>
⬥ After casting <:havoc:535532879300526080> or <:smash:535532879820619786> with Gloves of Passage equipped:
    • The target will take 20% increased damage from bleeds for 17t (10.2s).
        - This also applies to existing bleeds and non-melee bleeds.
    • The next ability cast within 6s/10t will do 10% more damage.

.
⬥ The 10% damage boost works as follows when stalling abilities (if an Essence of Finality <:eof:787526151978614824> is worn):
    • All abilities released on the same tick will be boosted (if cast with the same mainhand weapon).
    • If you cast <:havoc:535532879300526080> / <:smash:535532879820619786> → stall ability 1 → release ability 1 + cast ability 2, both abilities will get buffed
    • If you stall <:havoc:535532879300526080> / <:smash:535532879820619786> and release it with another ability, the other ability will consume the buff.
    • How to boost 2 hits of a barge bleed + next ability:
        - Barge bleed has to be released on tick 3 (tick 0 stall).
        - The next ability cast on tick 4.
        - This allows you to boost 4 hits when stalling a barge bleed into <:cane:535532878969438210> / <:overpower:535532879334080517>.

.
⬥ The 10% damage boost works as follows when stalling abilities (if an <:eof:787526151978614824> isn't worn) [*requires further testing*].
    • Instead of boosting all abilities on just 1 tick, the following tick will also be boosted.
    • This allows you to 5TAA → ability and get both boosted.
    • Alternatively the first ability can be click or walk-in released 2 ticks after stalling it and the following ability can be cast on tick 3 as normal.
    • If click releasing an ability on tick 2, an <:eof:787526151978614824> can be equipped tick 3 along with casting an ability and both abilities will still be boosted. This will not work if the abilities are 2H, channeled, or weapon special attacks.*

Note: * Requires further testing.

**__Flanking__** <:flankicon:841419289755385866>
⬥ This turns Backhand <:backhand:535532854302605333> and Forceful Backhand <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun
    • It increases Minimum of <:backhand:535532854302605333> by 8% per Flanking rank and its Max by 40% per Flanking rank
    • It increases Minimum of <:fbackhand:535532879346794516> by 6% per Flanking rank and its Max by 30% per Flanking rank

⬥ It is recommended to put this perk on an off-hand switch
    • Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switches

⬥ In order to get 2 <:backhand:535532854302605333> in one <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotation, the first <:backhand:535532854302605333> must be at the latest the second ability after <:zerk:535532854004678657>.

    • Dismember <:dismember:535532879376023572> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits, and up to 10 with the Strength Cape <:strcape:689503815296352308> effect)
    • Slaughter <:slaughter:535532879237873666> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)
    • Blood Tendrils <:bloodtendrils:535532854327640064> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)
    • Ez-Zekkil spec <:zekkil:903244090953588787> <:spec:537340400273195028> (bringing it to 9 from 6 hits)
    • Massacre <:massacre:535532879384543253> (bringing it to 7 from 5 hits)
⬥ It is better to use it as a switch for the above 3 abilities as you can perk it to have <:lunge4:736522494315593759> to boost <:dismember:535532879376023572> damage and get full benefit of normal DPS perks on your remaining abilities.

**__Laniakea Spear__** <:lanispear:839903893177106454>
⬥ T82 weapon with T90 damage and T75 accuracy
⬥ Passive effect: poison does +5% damage and procs 5% more often
    • This make it better than the Noxious Scythe <:noxscythe:513190159341322240> on poisonable targets where you have 100% accuracy
⬥ It is normally not worth using over higher tier weapons, but the following can make it whorwhile:
    • If Bik arrows are applied to your target
    • If using a Blood Reaver alongside Scrimshaw of Vampyrism <:VampScrim:513201294262009874> and/or Vampyrism aura <:vamp:643505653079343144>
    • If Lani flicking
        - Lani flicking is the act of casting abilities with your higher tier weapons, and then equipping the Laniakea spear inbetween during the GCD
        - This is extremely click intensive and prone to mistakes

> **__Autos__**
.tag:autos
**__Defensive Autos__**
.tag:defAutos
*Note: in this context "defensives" refer to any non-damaging abilities, and so includes things like Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657> and the Zaros Godsword spec <:zgs:626465964325601290> <:spec:537340400273195028>.*

.
**__Why Defensive Autos Exist__**
⬥ Typically, when you cast an auto or ability it put your Auto on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with
    • Cooldowns for various weapon speeds are as follows:
```
Speed (cooldown in ticks/seconds)
Slowest (12t/7.2s)
Average (6t/3.6s)
Fast (5t/3.0s)
Fastest (4t/2.4s)
```
*Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., "Average Ability") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it*

⬥ Non-damaging abilities are the exception to this rule, so if you cast one it will not put your auto on cooldown

.
**__What This Means__**
⬥ If you cast a fast/fastest ability into a defensive ability, your auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD)
    • For Melee this will just be your default auto, though you can alter it to a debuff spell like <:ent:567727987274022924> still by doing <:ent:567727987274022924> → Defensive
    • The following table will break down the ticks of this:
.
```
T0: Fast/Fastest Ability
T3: Defensive
T4/5: Auto is cast
T6: Ability
```
⬥ Video Demonstration (Courtesy of <@184952892422094848>):
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:sever:535532879577612298> → <:freedom:535541258240786434> → <:cleave:535532878616985610>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/hlw4KFW.mp4
.
    • Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H auto, as the cooldown for any auto ends on t4
        - So, you would simply swap to a 2H weapon between the Fast/Fastest Ability cast to before the Auto would be cast

.
**__Freedom__**
It is important to note that Freedom <:freedom:535541258240786434> works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a mainhand/2H auto
⬥ You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by doing auto → <:freedom:535541258240786434> on the same tick.
    • To do this with Melee you will need an off-hand magic weapon on (e.g., Ancient Lantern <:ancientlantern:580177522503712781>), and to have an offhand autocast spell set (Polypore Strike <:polyporestrike:859483781487394826> recommended)
⬥ An example of getting both offhand and 2H auto can be seen in this clip by @Wh#4119: <https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8>
    • It is important to stress that you should not swap to 2H too early, otherwise you will lose the offhand auto. You should swap 1t after you cast <:freedom:535541258240786434>

.
**__5TAA__**
.tag:5TAA
*Note: Any time a speed is before an auto/ability (e.g., "Average Ability") this simply refers to the weapon speed used to cast it*

.
**__What It is__**
⬥ This is pretty similar to 4TAA, but Melee does not have an auto bind, and so must wait an additonal tick before casting their ability.
    • With Revolution, some extra effort must be done to 5TAA
        - First, use Cease <:cease:864235458464186418> after casting your ability
        - Second, click the target 1t after the GCD ends
        - Finally, use an ability 1t after that
.
⬥ So, instead of doing:
```
T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T4: Auto + Ability
```
⬥ You do
```
T0: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T4: Auto auto-casts
T5: Ability
```
⬥ It is important to note that the ability before must be a fastest non-channeled ability
    • Further the ability before that cannot be a slow/fast/average-speed channeled ability

⬥ Video Demonstration (Courtesy of <@184952892422094848>):
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:sever:535532879577612298> → (wait 4t) auto fires → (wait 1t) <:cleave:535532878616985610>
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/1KJ1v9d.mp4
.
⬥ This is because Autos normally are executed after abilities in a tick, so using an ability on the same tick it is casted will override it as it incurs the auto cooldown, hence the need to delay the ability an additional tick to get the auto in

.
⬥ Video Demonstration For Revolution:
    • Abilities used in clip:
        - <:deci:535532879325822986> + <:cease:864235458464186418> → (wait 4t) click on target → (wait 1t) <:sever:535532879577612298>

**__When It is Used__**
⬥ When using the Abyssal Scourge <:abyssalscourge:947871842469834832> with the Jaws of the Abyss <:jawsoftheabyss:947871842595639306>, 5TAA is rarely used as a 3 hit <:gflurry:535532879283879977> gives the same result.
⬥ 5TAA is primarily done to align ticks so you can cast an ability on the last tick of Berserk, this is typical in Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012> rotations that use one 7t channel (e.g., 4-hit Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>) without the ability to use a 5t channel (e.g., 3-hit Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>) to align ticks, as can be seen below:
```
T0: Zerk
T3-6: 2x Ability
T9: 7t channeled Ability
T16-19: 2x Ability
T22: Fastest non-channeled Ability
T26: Auto auto-casts
T27-30: 2x Ability
T33: Ability + Zerk ends
```
.
⬥ By using a 5TAA it was possible to get an ability on the last tick of <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, so it hits after <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ends and thus get both <:Berserk:513190158468907012> and Berserker Aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> damage modifiers

**__Difference in the Above Clips__**
As seen, they both follow the same ability order, except the first has an auto, and the other has a non-boosted Decimate <:deci:535532879325822986> after Quake <:quake:535532879506309150>

⬥ In the clip where 5TAA is used, <:quake:535532879506309150> does more damage (8451 vs 7644)

⬥ The <:deci:535532879325822986> after the <:quake:535532879506309150> was used to display how you cannot fit another ability by skipping the auto anyway, so to make full use of <:Berserk:513190158468907012> ticks you want to 5TAA

**__Applying Smoke Cloud__** <:smokecloud:856635090641879050>
.tag:smoke
**__How to Apply It__**
There are two ways to go about applying Smoke Cloud with Melee:
⬥ **4-ticking it**
    • Similar to doing 5TAA, except you will do <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> + Ability on the 4th tick, instead of doing an ability on the 5th tick
        - 4th/5th tick are in relation to the ability before it being on tick 0
    • This costs an additional tick compared to using <:freedom:535541258240786434>. So, if done in Berserk <:zerk:535532854004678657>, to ensure you realign back to final tick of <:zerk:535532854004678657>:
        - If a 7t channel is done in <:zerk:535532854004678657> then you will have to do another 7t channel, or drop a tick somewhere (e.g., <:zerk:535532854004678657> 1t earlier before a fight starts)
        - If a 7t channel is not done then you will have to 5TAA or do a 5t channel

⬥ **Using Freedom** <:freedom:535541258240786434>
    • Replacing the offhand <:freedom:535541258240786434> auto for Smoke Cloud <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> by doing <:smokecloud:856635090641879050> → <:freedom:535541258240786434>
        - It is worth noting this requires an offhand autocast spell like Polypore Strike <:polyporestrike:859483781487394826> to be set beforehand, as well as an offhand Magic weapon being equipped

.
⬥ **Target Cycling**
    • If starting an encounter without wanting to get Greater Barge off, Smoke Cloud can be applied by using Target Cycle + smoke cloud + ability in the same tick.
    • Here's a clip showing it off (courtesy of <@920182208508088320>
