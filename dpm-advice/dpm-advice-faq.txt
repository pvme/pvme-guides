.
**__Why it’s important:__** 
Depending on 👎 what 💦 ability 👉 you cancelled late, you will lose 🚫 anywhere from 👑👉 1 🤜👆 to 🎶 3 ticks every channeled ability 👉 you 👈 don’t cancel properly. 

As an example, in a 5 minute gem you will use up to 12 Asphyx's <:asphyx:535533833072672778> , assuming you don't cancel them, it will add up to 21.6 seconds that you’re standing idle for. That’s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

**__Why it’s important:__** 
With Magic <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Ranged <:ds:535541258924326912>, the expected number of thresholds with an Adrenaline Potion is 6. with Melee <:Berserk:513190158468907012> using up to 3. These numbers may vary depending on your adrenaline gained with other sources.

**__How to fix:__** 
Take a look in <#534567464370044928> <#563917498169425930> <#534912860711550989> to see the optimal threshold order.

**__Why it’s important:__** 
Some thresholds have different damage values when used inside a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>, and Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, it is thus necessary to understand their differences for proper priorization.

As silly 😤😂 as 🅰 it 😩😢 may 🏻 sound, 🔊🎶 pressing stronger 💪 buttons will 👊📌 greatly increase 💳 your 📕 DPM moreso than 🙅👉 any other 💦👪 gear upgrade.

> __**Lossless Auto Attack at the start of your ultimate**__
.tag:uauto
.
**__Cause__**
Not ❌🚫 releasing the 👹 auto 🤖 attack, 🤼🤼 or 💀 releasing a dual 🏏 wield auto attack. 🤼⚔

**__Why it’s important:__** 
It’s 💯 a lossless attack ⚔ (no lost ticks). 

**__How to fix:__** 
Use a 👌 dual-wield 🏏🔫 ability before activating your 🏻👄 ultimate, and 💰💯 immediately after 👀👀 activating your 👏💦 ultimate switch to 💦👆 a 👌💰 2h and 👏🕋 click 🖱 on 💦🏻 the target to 💣💰 obtain a 📢👉 free auto 🤖 attack ⚔ before 🍑 the GCD is over. 😩😢 

Clicking the target is only ❗ necessary if you ☝ clicked your Planted Feet/2h 👣 switch from 💩👈 your inventory. If 👏👏 you keybound everything, disregard clicking the 👏⛓ target; the auto 🤖 will 🏻 come with ⛹🅱 no 🚫🚫 extra 🗣 input needed. 🤒😫

> __**Utilizing Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> in your rotation**__
.tag:flank
.
**__Why it’s important:__** 
Your basic Flanking is 🈶😈 a 🎹 260% ability and 👏👮 is better 🏿 than nearly any 🌐🚸 other 🕹👈 basic 🌑🌑 ability 👉 in 📅 terms of 💦 damage. 

**__How to fix:__** 
Practice. 🍆 Make an 👌👏 effort 💯🙁 to 🙍💦 use it 🏼 as 👦🕐 often 💰 as 🅰🍑 possible. 🔝🔝

.
**__Why it's important:__** 
Prioritizing strong abilities over weaker 👎👎 abilities.

**__How to fix__** 
For 🖋👉 Revolution, 👺 take a look 🕊👁 at 💰❓ the 👉 official RuneScape Wiki and set 👌 up an 〰👹 optimized revolution 💥🔫 bar. 

For full manual, take a look at this spreadsheet to understand which abilities are stronger. **<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>**

.
> __**Managing cooldowns of good abilities**__
.tag:managing
.
**__Why it’s important:__** 
Your 💦👗 good 👍 abilities often 💰 come with a 💰👏 long 🍆 cooldown, using 📤 them 👹 first all 👇🏳 at once will leave 🤔👏 you 🅱 with 👩👀 weaker 👎👎 abilities for a 💨 large 🏔🏔 period of 💦💦 time 🕜

**__How to fix:__** 
By using filler abilities such as Sonic Wave <:Sonic:535533809924571136>, Concentrated Blast <:Conc:535533833106489365>, Dazing Shot <:Dazing:535541307142307860> <:mds:535541259033378827>, Needle Strike <:Needle_Strike:535541259108876293>, Fury <:Fury:535532879510372352> <:Mut_Fury:535532879334080527>, Cleave <:Cleave:535532878616985610>, and Decimate <:Deci:535532879325822986> (abilities that have decent damage with a short cooldown) in-between the strong abilities, you can craft a rotation where you will never run into a scenario where you have to resort to weaker abilities.

.
> __**Losing ticks**__
.tag:losing
.
**__Cause__**
Not ❌ inputting the 👏👏 next ⏩ ability 👉👉 fast 🚀🏃 enough, 💦 having 👉🍽 trouble determining what is 🔥🤔 the 🏻 next ▶ ability, 👉👉 or 💰 clicking and 💦😍 being 😥 slow 👏⏳ on 🏿 weapon switches

**__Why it’s important:__** 
Same rationale as canceling channels. This 👁😷 adds 🚫 up 👆👆 overtime to 🚓🖇 lost 🤔🍆 abilities.

**__How to fix:__** 
Practice, try 😥🏃 and 😍 think 💭🤔 2 💕👙 abilities ahead and 👅🤷 plan 🔊👏 out 💯 your rotation. 

.
> __**Changing weapons mid-channel ability**__
.tag:changing
.
**__Why it’s important:__** 
Changing your weapon mid-Conc <:conc:535533833106489365> will cancel it. Thus this requires precise timing to make sure you’re still getting 2 hits from your conc blast. Further, changing your main-hand mid-Conc <:conc:535533833106489365> will lose you the crit bonus from the ability. 

**__How to fix:__** 
Practice 🍆🍆 the 👏👮 timing.
