> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over fundamental terminology, combat modes, and ways that you as a player can avoid making common mistakes while trying to improve your own damage output

.
> **__Terminology__**
.tag:Abb
**__Common Abbreviations in PvM__**
⬥ **DPM** - damage per minute, a measure of how much damage is done over a minute time
⬥ **DPS** – damage per second, or in-general referring to damage
⬥ **DW** – dual wield weapon
⬥ **2H** – two handed weapon
⬥ **Juggling/Swapping** – generally referring to switching between DW and 2H weapons to gain access to more damaging abilities
⬥ **Camping** – refers to using only one type of weapon, ie. 2H camping or DW camping
⬥ **Rotation** – refers to the usage of abilities and managing ability cooldowns
⬥ **Switch** – refers to a weapon or gear item that is equipped and use temporarily for its effects
⬥ **Auto** – an auto attack, NOT an ability
⬥ **Tick** – a unit of time in which a game action can occur. Runescape's tick is 0.6 seconds in duration
⬥ **Lossless** - meaning no ticks are lost in performing an action
⬥ **GCD** - global cooldown. An innate cooldown built into every ability. Lasts for 3 ticks (1.8 seconds)
*Note: For more abbreviations, see Evil Lucario's list of common PVM Lingo and Abbreviations: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZmDhx-SJsrVo0iTNwgMN3YsuJ9CrHcySd3hptvz3Ds/>*

> **__Revolution++__**
.tag:revo++
⬥ Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline

.
⬥ We do not encourage using Revo++ as it is severely limiting; however, it can be desirable for low-input play such as AFKing or Slayer

.
⬥ To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar:

> **__Basic Revolution__**
.tag:revo
⬥ Basic Revolution (commonly referred to as simply "Revolution") is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated

.
⬥ Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities

.
⬥ Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar − you will be manually activating them

.
⬥ With revolution activating all basic abilities, the following strategy is recommended:
    • Activate your damage boosting Ultimate <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> / <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> / <:Berserk:513190158468907012> once you reach 100% adrenaline
        - From there, use your thresholds and modified ultimates whenever you reach the requisite amount of adrenaline, and repeat

.
⬥ Following this simple repeating pattern of *Build to 100% → Damage-Boosting Ultimate → Thresholds and Modified Ultimates → Repeat*, one can expect to reach a moderate level of DPM with low-medium player input

> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player
    • No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player

.
⬥ The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario

.
⬥ Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimates

.
⬥ Transitioning from revolution to full manual can seem intimidating, but all it takes is practice

.
⬥ Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates
    • The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe
        - Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution

.
⬥ An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy
    • Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta)

.
⬥ There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!

>  __**Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them**__
.tag:mistakes
The following list notes some of the common mistakes made by players in PvM. It is likely that as you work towards improving your DPM, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then working on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, everything just takes practice

**__Channeled Abilities__**
⬥ Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>: 2hit (3t/1.8s)
⬥ Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>: 3hit (3t/1.8s)

⬥ Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>: 2-hit (3t/1.8s), or 3-hit (5t/3.0s)
*Note: The listed cancel timings are standard, depending on overall rotation the cancel time you use may vary*

.
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ It is important to properly cancel abilities in order to not lose any ticks, or damage potential
    • Animations can be unreliable, and longer than the actual duration of the ability
    • It can be higher damage-per-tick, or net you more adrenaline, to cancel long channels early
    • Greater Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107>, and Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> may suffer a 1t delay when revolution is enabled

.

> __**Ability Prioritisation**__
.tag:prio
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ As silly as it may sound, pressing stronger buttons will greatly increase your DPM moreso than any other gear upgrade
    • In other words, you should know which abilities are strong in which scenarios, and use that to your advantage

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Take a look in <#534567464370044928>, <#563917498169425930>, and <#534912860711550989> to get an idea of how to prioritize each ability under certain conditions
    • The numbers behind these can be found here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>
    • Note how the same ability can be prioritized differently depending on the scenario; for example:
        - Bleeds (including <:comb:535533833098100745> <:corruptblast:513190159194259467> <:frag:535541273755385885> <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> <:dismember:535532879376023572> <:BloodTend:513190158431158274> <:slaughter:535532879237873666>) are lower priority when under the effects of damage-boosting ultimates <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> / <:deathsswift:535541258924326912> / <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, because their damage is not boosted by these abilities. In fact, if using a Berserker-variant aura <:berserker:643505116347105290> <:reckless:643505179378974748> <:mani:643505153709965322>, these abilities will actually be worse than if used outside these ultimates, as the direct damage boost from these auras is lost

.
> __**Managing Cooldowns**__
.tag:cooldowns
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ Strong abilities often come with long cooldowns. This poses an inherent problem: if you use all your strong abilities at once, you'll be left with only weak abilities until they are available again

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Your goal should be to make use of "filler" abilities, ones with decent damage and short cooldowns, in-between your strong abilities in order to "manage" their cooldowns
⬥ Managing your cooldowns effectively will translate to a direct DPM increase, as you will be using fewer weak abilities overall
    • Examples of such abilities are Sonic Wave <:Sonic:535533809924571136>, (Greater) Concentrated Blast <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:Conc:535533833106489365>, (Greater) Dazing Shot <:mds:535541259033378827> / <:Dazing:535541307142307860>, Needle Strike <:Needle_Strike:535541259108876293>, (Greater) Fury <:Mut_Fury:535532879334080527> / <:Fury:535532879510372352>, Cleave <:Cleave:535532878616985610>, and Decimate <:Deci:535532879325822986>

.
> __**Losing Ticks**__
.tag:losing
**__Cause__**
⬥ Not inputting the next ability fast enough, having trouble determining what is the next ability, or clicking and being slow on weapon switches

.
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ Same rationale as canceling channels. These losses add up over time to a large amount of wasted damage potential

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Practice lots. Try and think 2 abilities ahead and plan out your rotation

.
> __**Auto Attacks with Ultimates**__
.tag:uauto
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ They are lossless, which means "free" damage with your ultimate! However, mistakes can result in them being outright lost, or its damage being significantly reduced, notably:
    • Not releasing the auto attack, or releasing a dual wield auto attack instead of a 2H auto attack

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Use a non-channelled dual-wield ability before activating your ultimate, and immediately after activating your ultimate switch to a 2H and click on the target to obtain a free auto attack before the GCD is over
    • Clicking the target is only necessary if you clicked your Planted Feet/2H switch from your inventory. If you keybound everything, disregard clicking the target; the auto will come with no extra input needed

.
> __**Utilizing Flanking**__ <:flank4:712073088296157185>
.tag:flank
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ Your basic flanking (<:impactflank:867678154369400862>, <:bindingshotflank:867678153400647701>, <:backhandflank:867678153854025779>) are 260% abilities and are better than nearly any other basic ability in terms of damage

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Practice. Understand where it is feasible to use, how to do so, and make an effort to incorporate it into your rotation

.
> __**Changing Weapons Mid-Channel Ability**__
.tag:changing
**__Why it’s Important__**
⬥ Changing your weapon mid-chanel, for example, <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365>, will cancel the ability
⬥ Therefore, precise timing is required to ensure you’re still getting all hits from your channel
    • There are further implications as well, for example, changing your main-hand during or after <:gconc:869285393223254107> / <:conc:535533833106489365> will lose you the crit bonus from the ability

.
**__How to Fix__**
⬥ Practice the timing as described earlier
