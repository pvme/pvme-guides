>  __**Common Mistakes Made in Combat and How to Fix Them**__
.tag:intro
The following list notes some of the common mistakes made by players in PvM. It is likely that if you're working on upping your DPM, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then work on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, everything takes practice.

**__Channeled Abilities__**
⬥ Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>: 2hit (3t/1.8s)

⬥ Rapid fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>: 8 hit (8t/4.8s)
⬥ Assault <:assault:535532853979512842>: 4hit (7t/4.2s)
⬥ Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352>: 4hit (7t/4.2s)
⬥ Greater Flurry <:gflurry:535532879283879977>: 2 or 3 hit(3t/1.8s or 5t/3.0s)

*Note: The listed cancel timings are standard, depending on overall rotation the cancel time you use may differ.*

.
**__Why it’s Important__**
Depending on what ability you cancelled late, you will lose anywhere from 1 to 3 ticks every channeled ability you don’t cancel properly.

As an example, in a 5 minute gem you will use up to 12 Asphyx's <:asphyx:535533833072672778> , assuming you don't cancel them, it will add up to 21.6 seconds that you’re standing idle for. That’s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

.

> __**Threshold Prioritisation During Your Ultimate**__
.tag:tdu
**__Why it’s Important__**
With Magic <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Ranged <:ds:535541258924326912>, the expected number of thresholds with an Adrenaline Potion is 6. with Melee <:Berserk:513190158468907012> using up to 3. These numbers may vary depending on your adrenaline gained with other sources.

.
**__How to Fix__**
Take a look in <#534567464370044928> <#563917498169425930> <#534912860711550989> to see the optimal threshold order.

.
> __**Threshold Prioritisation Outside Your Ultimate**__
.tag:tou
**__Why it’s Important__**
Some thresholds have different damage values when used inside a Sunshine <:Sunshine:583430011948630016>, Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>, and Berserk <:Berserk:513190158468907012>, it is thus necessary to understand their differences for proper priorization.

.
> __**Ability Prioritisation During Your Ultimate**__
.tag:uprio
**__Why it’s Important__**
As silly as it may sound, pressing stronger buttons will greatly increase your DPM moreso than any other gear upgrade.

.
**__How to Fix__**
Familiarize yourself with which abilities you should prioritise at any given time: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>

.
> __**Lossless Auto Attack at the Start of Your Ultimate**__
.tag:uauto
**__Cause__**
Not releasing the auto attack, or releasing a dual wield auto attack.

.
**__Why it’s Important__**
It’s a lossless attack (no lost ticks).

.
**__How to Fix__**
Use a dual-wield ability before activating your ultimate, and immediately after activating your ultimate switch to a 2h and click on the target to obtain a free auto attack before the GCD is over.

Clicking the target is only necessary if you clicked your Planted Feet/2h switch from your inventory. If you keybound everything, disregard clicking the target; the auto will come with no extra input needed.

.
> __**Utilizing Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> in Your Rotation**__
.tag:flank
**__Why it’s Important__**
Your basic Flanking is a 260% ability and is better than nearly any other basic ability in terms of damage.

.
**__How to Fix__**
Practice. Make an effort to use it as often as possible.

.
> __**Ability Prioritisation in Your Rotation**__
.tag:prio
.
**__Why it's Important__**
Prioritizing strong abilities over weaker abilities.

.
**__How to Fix__**
For Revolution, take a look at the official RuneScape Wiki and set up an optimized revolution bar.

For full manual, take a look at this spreadsheet to understand which abilities are stronger. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>

.
> __**Managing Cooldowns of Good Abilities**__
.tag:managing
**__Why it’s Important__**
Your good abilities often come with a long cooldown, using them first all at once will leave you with weaker abilities for a large period of time

.
**__How to Fix__**
By using filler abilities such as Sonic Wave <:Sonic:535533809924571136>, Concentrated Blast <:Conc:535533833106489365>, Dazing Shot <:Dazing:535541307142307860> <:mds:535541259033378827>, Needle Strike <:Needle_Strike:535541259108876293>, Fury <:Fury:535532879510372352> <:Mut_Fury:535532879334080527>, Cleave <:Cleave:535532878616985610>, and Decimate <:Deci:535532879325822986> (abilities that have decent damage with a short cooldown) in-between the strong abilities, you can craft a rotation where you will never run into a scenario where you have to resort to weaker abilities.

.
> __**Losing Ticks**__
.tag:losing
**__Cause__**
Not inputting the next ability fast enough, having trouble determining what is the next ability, or clicking and being slow on weapon switches

.
**__Why it’s Important__**
Same rationale as canceling channels. This adds up overtime to lost abilities.

.
**__How to Fix__**
Practice, try and think 2 abilities ahead and plan out your rotation.

.
> __**Changing Weapons Mid-Channel Ability**__
.tag:changing
**__Why it’s Important__**
Changing your weapon mid-Conc <:conc:535533833106489365> will cancel it. Thus this requires precise timing to make sure you’re still getting 2 hits from your conc blast. Further, changing your main-hand mid-Conc <:conc:535533833106489365> will lose you the crit bonus from the ability.

.
**__How to Fix__**
Practice the timing.
