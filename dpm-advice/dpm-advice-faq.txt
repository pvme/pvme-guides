>  __**Common mistakes made in combat and on gems and to fix them:**__
.tag:intro
.
The following list notes some of the common mistakes made by players in PvM. It is likely that if you're working on upping your DPM, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then work on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, __everything takes practice.__

⬥ Asphyxiate <:asphyx:535533833072672778>
⬥ Rapid fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>
⬥ Assault <:assault:535532853979512842> 
⬥ Destroy <:destroy:535532879330148352> 
⬥ Concentrated Blast <:conc:535533833106489365>

⬥ Fury <:fury:535532879510372352> 

**Why it’s important:** Depending on what ability you cancelled late, you will lose anywhere from 1 to 3 ticks every channeled ability you don’t cancel properly. 

As an example, in a 5 minute gem you will use up to 12 Asphyx's <:asphyx:535533833072672778> , assuming you don't cancel them, it will add up to __21.6__ seconds that you’re standing idle for. That’s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

**Why it’s important:** With Magic <:Sunshine:583430011948630016> and Ranged <:ds:535541258924326912>, the expected number of thresholds with an Adrenaline Potion is 6. with Melee <:Berserk:513190158468907012> using up to 3. These numbers may vary depending on your adrenaline gained with other sources.

**How to fix:** Take a look in <#534567464370044928> <#563917498169425930> <#534912860711550989> to see the optimal threshold order.

.tag:uprio

    • **Why it’s important:** As silly as it may sound, pressing stronger buttons will greatly increase your DPM moreso than any other gear upgrade.

    •**How to fix:** Familiarize yourself with which abilities you should prioritise at any given time: **<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>**

.
> __**Lossless Auto Attack at the start of your ultimate**__
.tag:uauto
.
*Scenarios: No auto is released | Dual wield auto is released*
    • **Why it’s important:** It’s a lossless attack (no lost ticks). 

    • **How to fix:** Use a dual-wield ability before activating your ultimate, and immediately after activating your ultimate switch to a 2h and click on the target to obtain a free auto attack before the GCD is over. 

Clicking the target is only necessary if you clicked your Planted Feet/2h switch from your inventory. If you keybound everything, disregard clicking the target; the auto will come with no extra input needed.

.
> __**Utilizing Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> in your rotation**__
.tag:flank
.
    • **Why it’s important:** Your basic Flanking is a 260% ability and is __better than nearly any other basic ability__ in terms of damage. 

    • **How to fix:** Practice. Make an effort to use it as often as possible.

.
> __**Ability prioritization in your rotation**__
.tag:prio
.
    • **Why it's important:** Prioritizing strong abilities over weaker abilities.

    • **How to fix:** For Revolution, take a look at the official RuneScape Wiki and set up an optimized revolution bar. 

For full manual, take a look at this spreadsheet to understand which abilities are stronger. **<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OetEUz4xU5sg7pqmJBkkafmZIye8qoPOXprUPGhin14/edit?usp=sharing>**

.
> __**Managing cooldowns of good abilities**__
.tag:managing
.
    • **Why it’s important:** Your good abilities often come with a long cooldown, using them first all at once will leave you with weaker abilities for a large period of time

    • **How to fix:** by using __filler__ abilities such as Sonic Wave <:Sonic:535533809924571136>, Concentrated Blast <:Conc:535533833106489365>, Dazing Shot <:Dazing:535541307142307860>, Needle Strike <:Needle_Strike:535541259108876293>, Fury <:Fury:535532879510372352> <:Mut_Fury:535532879334080527>, Cleave <:Cleave:535532878616985610>, and Decimate <:Deci:535532879325822986> (abilities that have decent damage with a short cooldown) in-between the strong abilities, you can craft a rotation where you will never run into a scenario where you have to resort to weaker abilities.

.
> __**Losing ticks**__
.tag:losing
.
*Caused by: Not inputting the next ability fast enough | Having trouble determining what is the next ability | Clicking and/or being slow on weapon switches*

    • **Why it’s important:** Same rationale as canceling channels. This adds up overtime to lost abilities.

    • **How to fix:** Practice, try and think 2 abilities ahead and plan out your rotation. 

.
> __**Changing weapons mid-channel ability**__
.tag:changing
.
    • **Why it’s important:** Changing from DW to 2H mid-Conc <:conc:535533833106489365>  will lose you the crit bonus from the ability. This requires precise timing to make sure you’re still getting 2 hits from your conc blast. Moreover, this resets your auto cooldown which is bad for 4TAA.

    • **How to fix:** Practice the timing.
