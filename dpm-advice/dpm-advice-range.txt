> **__Introduction__**
.tag:intro
In RuneScape PvM, the meta at the time of writing is about pushing out as much damage in as little time as possible. It is important to understand that good and efficient PvM, especially at the higher tiers, is about squeezing out as much damage as possible in between mechanics. This channel will go over general damage output lessons, ability prioritizations, crafting a rotation, a learning path, common mistakes, and tips and tricks.

> **__Revolution__**
.tag:revo++
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ is a combat mode wherein you can toggle the game to automatically activate basic, threshold, and ultimate abilities automatically upon reaching the required adrenaline.

.
⬥ While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance.

.
⬥ Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks.

.
⬥ Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++, using this bar with 0 player input will yield ~130k DPM:
.

.
⬥ To toggle on Revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the clog icon on your ability bar:

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
Basic Revolution (commonly referred to as simply "Revolution") is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated.

.
⬥ Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities.

.
⬥ Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution:
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ZKwiC3l.png
.
    • Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar − you will be manually activating them.

.
⬥ If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you.
    • Activate Death Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> once you reach 100% adrenaline.
        - From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088>, Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, etc). Repeat.

⬥ Follow this simple repeating pattern as a standard base to follow in Combat Dummies to reach 150k DPM:
    • Build to 100% → Death Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> → Thresholds → Repeat. One can expect to reach around 150k DPM with low to medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player.
    • No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player.

.
⬥ The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario.

.
⬥ Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate.
    • Refer to the revolution bars as examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice.

.
⬥ Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates.
    • The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe.
        - Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution.

.
⬥ An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy.
    • Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough.

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta).

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation__**
.tag:prioritization
**__Ability Priorization__**
⬥ Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities
    • However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns.
        - If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again – during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities.

.
⬥ To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND short cooldowns, in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns.

.
⬥ See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum):
.
.img:https://i.imgur.com/4zBiGNb.png
.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind.

⬥ Filler abilities such as Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> and Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770>, Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, Binding Shot-Flanking <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, and Fragmentation Shot-Walk <:frag:535541273755385885>.

⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability, such as Piercing Shot<:piercing:535541258538450944>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> without Flanking, Richochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> on a single target.
    • Generally speaking, these should be avoided

.
⬥ If you are 2h or dual wield camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> / <:mds:535541259033378827> or Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> or Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> as often as possible in your rotations.
    • A basic pattern of Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle <:needle:535541259108876293> and Dazing <:dazing:535541307142307860> / <:mds:535541259033378827> as filler abilities. Giving you access to stronger rotations.
    • This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> → Ability → Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> → Ability → Repeat will give you strong dps.

.
> **__Bakriminel Bolts__**
.tag:bakrbolts
Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using bolt carrying weapons, it is highly recommended that you bring these bolts for increased DPM.

*Note: If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta*.

**__Ruby Bolts__** <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
Overall the best bolts for general PvM. A 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups.

The HP to switch at varies per target, and it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt once the overriden hits are lower than expected.

*Note: Rubies are banned from combat dummy gems as its difficult to accurately measure your DPM with their effects.*

.
**__Onyx Bolts__** <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>
A 10% chance to activate, increasing damage by 25% on activation and healing for the same amount. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after Rubies <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> are no longer effective.

.
**__Hydrix Bolts__** <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>
A 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>.

.
> **__130k/140k DPM__**
.tag:one
**__Priorizing Thresholds__**
⬥ At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Death's Swiftness, if you haven't already, you should get a Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Death's Swiftness.

⬥ Learning which thresholds to prioritize and use in an Ultimate is extremely important to maximize your dpm. It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Swiftness with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion. Not having a planted feet switch will also cut your ultimates short by 1 threshold, generally speaking. Its heavily recommended to familiarize yourself with the strength of your abilities in: <#562827048914124800>.

*Note: This section assumes no Flanking Switches*

Your threshold order in Death's Swiftness should be:
⬥ **With Adrenaline Potion:**
Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>

⬥ **Without Adrenaline Potion:**
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284>

.
> **__150k/160k DPM__**
.tag:two
**__Invention Perks__**
At this stage, pushing to the next will almost certainly require the usage of a Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch, as well as a Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> switch. Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows:

⬥ **With Adrenaline Potion:**
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>  > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> > Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> > Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> > Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>


⬥ **Without Adrenaline Potion:**
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> > Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600>

⬥ **Notes:**
    • We remove Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> from our threshold rotations as they are all replaced with Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185>.
    • Remember to use your Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> switch for basics, not just for thresholds. Using it on Binding Shot<:bindingshot:535541306563231790> improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 260% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players.

.
**__Weapon Switching__**
⬥ Once you're at 160k DPM, reaching higher levels of DPM will require either lots of min-max optimizations, or incorporating weapon switching.

⬥ Assuming you have been DW camping until this point, obtaining an SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> or a Decimation <:decimation:643848618477879328> bow will allow you to DW/2H switch without switching ammo.
    • Start focusing on never using an ability worse than 157% ability damage. Any Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> or Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880> in your rotation should be swapped for a Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860>.

⬥ Maintain the same threshold order in Death's Swiftness and remember to Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> before Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> for higher damage.

⬥ From this point onwards we will also incorporate ways to force auto attacks.
    • For Death's Swiftness, using a dw MH for Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> then switching to 2H will also force an auto attack, which can contribute significant damage. Sometimes clicking your target is necessary to force the auto attack. The sequence of actions goes as follows:
        - Equip DW PF → Activate Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> → Equip 2h within GCD → Click target (auto attack will come out here) → Activate Ability.

⬥ Using Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> with 2H after using a DW ability with a 'fastest' speed weapon allows for stacking an auto on top of the tendrils.

.
> **__170/180k+ DPM__**
.tag:three
**__Bakriminel Switching__**
⬥ If you would like to progress further up you will have to learn Bakriminel Bolt switching.

⬥ Various bolts provide a variety of effects which can be useful under different circumstances . Since Rubies are our primary bolt and have an innate cooldown, we can bypass any downtime by switching to another bolt to get the most out of their effects at any given time.
    • Bolt switches are usually done between the three meta bolts: Ruby, Onyx, and Hydrix.
        - The idea is to pick two or three bolts for a given scenario to minimize downtime between bolt cooldowns and to maximize their effects.

⬥ For example, the most effective bolt when fighting <#534612663523737619> <:Nex:513213159071547395> are Ruby bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> as they are the best dps bolts.
    • However, when attacking minions the most effective bolt becomes Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> as minions have a soft hitcap of 1000 so any Ruby procs are wasted.
        - During the last phase, the most effective bolt on Nex becomes Onyx <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> as she is lower than 100k hp thus reducing Ruby's effectiveness.

> **__Weapon Overrides__**
.tag:overrides
Certain weapon types for Ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage with a 2H Cbow/Bow or DW Cbow to only take 1 tick to deal damage depending on your distance from your target's true centre instead. Slow abilities which are unaffected by overrides include: Needle <:needle:535541259108876293>, Binding <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, and Tight Binding <:tight:535541275957657600>

.
**__Override Types__**
*Note: The system used here is such that MD = Tile 1 from True Centre, and MD → x means MD to Tile x from True Centre, so MD → 2 = MD to Tile 2 from True Centre*

⬥ **Javelins** (only mainhand required)
    • Unload <:unload:535541258664411169> hits fast at MD → 3

.
**__Notable benefits__**
Included but not limited to:

⬥ **Nex** <:Nex:513213159071547395>
    • Each phase will be a tick faster, up to 6s faster for the whole kill.
    • Phasing faster will reduce the danger from some of her special attacks, including but not limited to Embrace the Shadows, Blood Siphon, and Die in a Prison of Ice.

⬥ **Raksha** <:raksha:789813907706478603>
    • Faster hitting abilities can mean phasing before an auto, saving several ticks.
    • Faster hitting abilities can mean you get a mind poison skip when you otherwise would have not, saving several seconds.

⬥ **Vorago** <:vorago:572867742613635082>
    • Allows you better choices of what to Target Cycle on Phase 1, and Teamsplit and The End P3s.
    • Can allow you to fit an extra ability's hit in before reflect.
    • Allows consistent 0-speccing

⬥ **Eldritch Crossbow** <:ecb:615618531937222657>
    • Split Soul damage is only applied if your hit would've healed you from Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> within the duration of your special attack, this can have a substantial impact on your rotations by allowing you to fit in more abilities on the given window.

.
> **__Shadow Tendrils__**
.tag:Tendril
**__What Makes It Special__**
Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, despite deal damage, acts as a non-damaging ability with a couple caveats.
⬥ This allows you to use what is colloqually referred to as "Defensive Autos" with it.
    • These are simply lossless autos that fire during non-damaging abilities as they do not reset your Auto cooldown.

.
**__How It Works__**
⬥ To get your Auto with Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> you must perform a non-channeled fastest speed weapon ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.
    • For example, Needle <:needle:535541259108876293> with Blightbound Crossbows <:bbc:626714879218155521> <:bbcoh:626714879230738434>.

.
⬥ To further make use of this interaction, you want to ensure that this Auto is a 2h-Auto, such as SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> or ECB <:ecb:615618531937222657>, or Dbow <:dbow:643848618553507843> (where accuracy permits).
    • To do this, simply swap to your 2h after your ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, or swap to your 2h directly as you or after you cast Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.
.

.
**__Differences From Typical Non-Damaging Abilities__**
As mentioned prior, there are some caveats to this ability and they are as follows:
⬥ You cannot delay the Auto with Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> like other Defensive Autos.

⬥ Fast speed weapons do not work like with other Defensive Autos.
    • Thus, the non-channeled ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> must be fastest.

⬥ You have to spam click if you want to get Auto after Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> if you offed for some reason before it, though clicking once before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> works too.
