## > __Ability Prioritisation__
.tag:priority
⬥ Generally, high damaging abilities should be prioritised and used more often than low damaging abilities.
⬥ To compare abilities, use [RS Analysis' Ranged Page](<https://rs-analysis.xyz/ranged.html>), and add your gear.
.
*Note: This does **not** give an ability rotation, only a damage comparison chart. It does not consider Ability Cooldowns, Adrenaline, or any specific PvM encounter.*

## > __Bows vs Dual Wield__ <:noxbow:513190159425208342>
.tag:camping
**Bows are the current recommended weapons of choice** due to having access to arrows that provide better effects than crossbow bolts and most best-in-slot ranged gear having effects designed for bows.

Certain types of arrows like Wen <:wenarrow:971025697046925362>, Ful <:fularrow:971025696958853180>, and Deathspores <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> provide better damage and utility than what bolts such as Ruby Bakriminels <:rubybakri:565726489413287956> have to offer.

One point of concern for Ranged <:range:580168050121113623> is **adrenaline** - Hydrix Bakriminel bolts <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> provide *incredible* adrenaline gain, and Ranged <:range:580168050121113623> is a style that heavily benefits from excess adrenaline. However, the effect of Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> used in tandem with other critical hit buffs such as Erethdor's Grimoire <:grim:568262896375824385>, Elite Dracolich Armour <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168>, and Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> can easily provide this adrenaline while bow camping.

*See **__Related Channels__** at the bottom of this guide for recommended gearing upgrade order, Essence of Finality setups, and more.*

## > __Building a Ranged Rotation__ <:mds:535541259033378827>
.tag:rotation
.
⬥ Similar to other styles, a typical Ranged rotation uses the strongest basics available to build adrenaline, and spends it on the strongest available thresholds, ultimates, or special attacks.
    • To achieve this, we must think about the following **key considerations:**
        ⬩ Ability Cooldowns
        ⬩ Adrenaline
        ⬩ Ammo effects <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>
        ⬩ Boss HP and phases
    • If these considerations are well accounted for, you will be able to improvise rotations effectively.

*Note 1: This section does not go over the use of Bow of the Last Guardian <:bolg:994189289623662702> or Elite Dracolich Armour <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168>
Note 2: Replace any mentions of Greater Dazing Shot <:mds:535541259033378827> with Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> or Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> if not owned or camping dual-wield.
See __**Advanced Rotations**__ section further down for info on ranged rotations with best-in-slot gear.*

.
### Basic Pattern
⬥ Greater Dazing Shot <:mds:535541259033378827> should form the foundation of your rotation early on.
⬥ **The basic pattern uses <:mds:535541259033378827> often, in 'blocks' of 3 abilities**:
    • [<:mds:535541259033378827> → Ability → Ability ] → Repeat
.
⬥ **Prioritise Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> as often as possible if it is owned, and use the earlier pattern in-between.**
.
⬥ When building adrenaline, fill the empty slots with strong basics like the following, prioritising those that can crit:
    • Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238>
    • Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770>
    • Binding Shot (Flanking) <:bindingshotflank:867678153400647701>
    • Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944>
    • Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>
    • Frag Shot (Walked) <:frag:535541273755385885>
*Note: <:frag:535541273755385885> and <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> cannot crit but are still strong abilities.*
⬥ Once your rotation gets going, you can start using abilities like thresholds or better to fill in the blanks.

.
### Death's Swiftness
*Note: It is assumed that either the Planted Feet perk <:deathsswiftpf:994921597813137518> or Greater Death's Swiftness unlock has been obtained <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> for the purposes of this guide.*
.
⬥ Death's Swiftness <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> lasts 38.4 seconds, but only has a 60 second cooldown. **We want to prioritise building to 100% adrenaline and using it often, as it boosts damage by 50%.**
    • The exception to this is when the fight would end too quickly, or mechanics occur, and you can't benefit from the full duration.
    • Ideally, enter boss fights with 100% adrenaline so you can activate it immediately at the start.
.
⬥ Both in and out of Death's Swiftness <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121>, you will want to prioritise your strong thresholds, special attacks, and modified ultimates.
    • Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>
    • Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>
    • Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>
    • Tight Bindings (Flanking) <:tightbindingsflank:867678154096640010>
    • Igneous Deadshot <:deadshotigneous:959089455283728386>
    • Dark Bow (EoF) <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>
    • SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • BoLG <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028>
    • etc.
        ⬩ While under the effect of a crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> the use of basic abilities during <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> to build adrenaline can be greatly reduced.
⬥ **While waiting for <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> cooldown, you can use a few more thresholds, set up Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>, etc.**
    • You do not want to needlessly camp 100% adrenaline, and can start building when <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> is nearly ready to use again.
.
### Tips

⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than <:mds:535541259033378827> / <:piercing:535541258538450944> is considered a weak ability and should be avoided when possible. Sometimes you may be forced to use them. Don't sweat it too much.
    • Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>
    • Ricochet (non-greater) <:ricochet:535541259566186521>
    • Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>
    • Binding Shot (no Flank) <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>
    • Frag Shot (no Walking) <:frag:535541273755385885>
⬥ Keep in mind that Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770> and Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> are channelled abilities and should be cancelled with the next ability after 4 ticks and 8 ticks respectively, or **during the last segment of their channel bars.**
⬥ The damage buff gained through <:needle:535541259108876293> is wasted if the follow-up ability is a damage-over-time ability <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> / <:frag:535541273755385885> but sometimes it may be unavoidable.

It should be noted that all of the above rotations have stretches of filler globals, such as <:piercing:535541258538450944>, <:grico:787904334812807238>, <:snipe:535541258425204770>, or <:mds:535541259033378827>, intended to build adrenaline and fill the space between stronger cooldowns. With a crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>, such as Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215>, many of these globals can potentially be replaced by stronger adrenaline dumps such as <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> <:zammybow:1215929540908679208> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>, while leaving much of the adrenaline-building to <:grico:787904334812807238> / <:piercing:535541258538450944> and the crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>
*See __**Advanced Rotations**__ for examples of such rotations.*
.
## > __Ammo Information__ <:pernixsquiver:902209626450296892>
.tag:whatammo
Ranged weapons can use multiple types of ammo - bows consume *arrows*, and crossbows use *bolts*. While the choice of weapon (bow vs. crossbow) can be affected by the gear available, **your DPS can significantly improve if proper ammo is used**. In general, a bow will be preferred over a similarly tiered crossbow setup due to its ammo options.

**For a full list of what ammo to use at what bosses, use the `!ammo` command.**

.
__**Elder God Arrows**__

**Elder god arrows are T95 ammunition** made by charging dinarrows with resonant anima from GWD3, providing a variety of useful effects.
All Elder God arrows have a 33% of being consumed per ability (even if the ability does not benefit from them, e.g. Ful arrows <:fularrow:971025696958853180> on <:frag:535541273755385885>).

.
⬥ **Ful arrows** <:fularrow:971025696958853180>
    • All non-bleed abilities deal 15% more damage but have -10% hit chance.
    • **The most simple arrow to use when camped**, providing consistent damage bonuses with minor hit chance issues.
        ⬩ Hit chance issues are usually solved using an aura <:reckless:643505179378974748>, defence debuffs like black stone arrows <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617>, or affinity debuffs like <:swh:641670143197446182> <:spec:537340400273195028>

.
⬥ **Wen arrows** <:wenarrow:971025697046925362>
    • Basic abilities add a stack of *Icy Chill* <:icychill:1240756221024403526> per hit (capping at 15 stacks) that can be consumed by the next threshold or ultimate used to provide *Icy Precision* <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419>
    • *Icy Precision* <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> gives +3% damage and accuracy per stack for all threshold, ultimate, and special attack abilities, with the effect lasting 0.6s per consumed stack (Up to +45% damage for 9 seconds).
    • Stacks vanish after 30 seconds if not re-applied.
    • **The strongest damage boosting arrow when used properly**, but requires time to stack and planning within your rotation to use properly.

.
⬥ **Jas arrows** <:jasdragonbanearrow:971025697042755584>
    • Provides +30% damage and +20% hit chance against dragons.
    • **Best-in-slot ammunition for susceptible content** such as Queen Black Dragon, ED2 dragons + bosses, etc.
    • Jas arrows come in two variants - *dragonbane* and *demonbane*, that apply to the monsters implied by their names.

.
⬥ **Bik arrows** <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>
    • All abilities add a stack of *Evolving Toxin*, increasing poison damage <:poisonicon:944649693500154006> taken by 2% per stack, capping at 200 stacks (400% increased damage).
    • Stacks vanish after 30 seconds if not re-applied.
    • **Very strong in sustained, poisonable encounters.**
        ⬩ Examples include Solak, high enrage Arch-Glacor, Kerapac, etc.
    • See __**Poison Build Rotations**__ further below for optimizations involving Bik arrows.

.
__**Other Arrows**__

⬥ **Deathspore Arrows** <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>
    • T95 arrows that have the following effects:
        ⬩ +3% critical hit chance.
        ⬩ Critical hits give 1 stack of *Feasting Spores*.
        ⬩ At 5 stacks, the next ranged ability that would cost adrenaline is free (9s window to use it). **You must still have the required adrenaline to use the ability.**
        ⬩ This effect has a cooldown of 100t/60s, but each critical hit lowers it by 3t/1.8s.
    • **They can be used to guarantee a free ultimate**, and is commonly used to set up Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> or Death's Swiftness <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> and maintain full adrenaline to make use of their respective buffs.

⬥ **Black stone arrows** <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617>
    • T92 arrows with a passive effect where **each ability used with <:blackstonearrow:785031580149743617> lowers the target's defence** by 0.75% (up to 22 armour), capping at 15% (454 armour).
        ⬩ Arrows are not consumed past max stacks.
        ⬩ Abilities that hit multiple times (like Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> will apply one stack per hitsplat).
    • This is an easy way for rangers <:range:580168050121113623> **to increase hitchance** at encounters like Nex, Vorago (P5/10/11), Telos, etc.

.
__**Bakriminel Bolts**__

⬥ **Ruby Bakriminel bolts** <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956>
    • Has a **5% chance to trigger its effect, dealing an extra 25-125% additional ability damage hit** to the enemy at the expense of some lifepoints.
    • The effect weakens as the target drops to lower health.

.
⬥ **Onyx Bakriminel bolts** <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>
    • Has a **10% chance to increase damage dealt by 25% and heal 25% of damage dealt** in a hit.
    • Can give a reasonable amount of sustain in encounters, lowering the requirement for food.

⬥ **Hydrix Bakriminel bolts** <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822>
    • Has a **10% chance of granting 10% adrenaline instantly** and refreshing a buff that makes **basics give +1% adrenaline for 15 seconds**.
    • This makes them incredibly good for building adrenaline.
    • Often used as a bolt switch when camping dual-wield.

*Note: The proc chance on bakriminel bolts increases with Ranged cape perk <:rangedcape:1043953722633498754> and Elite Seers Village achievements completed.*

.
__**Pernix's Quiver**__ <:pernixsquiver:902209626450296892>

⬥ **Pernix's Quiver** is an ammo slot unlock that allows two different ammo types to be stored, saving an inventory slot and giving access to multiple keybinds that can make ammo swapping easier.
    • Unlocks **Quiver ammo slot 1** and **Quiver ammo slot 2** abilities in the ranged spellbook, allowing **swapping to the ammo in the respective slot.**
    • Acts as **Cycle Ammo** ability when the quiver itself is dragged onto the ability bar, allowing **swapping to the ammo that is not currently active.**
.img:https://img.pvme.io/images/DKjsxOkobI.png
    • Having multiple dyed quivers is possible <:pernixsquiverblue:923269339203903488> <:pernixsquivergreen:923269339325554688> and the active ammo will be remembered for each quiver individually.

## > __Important Ability Mechanics__
.tag:importantabil
Certain Ranged abilities are worth noting in particular, due to their behaviour and how they can be used. Here, we cover some of these abilities.

.
### __Greater Ricochet__ <:grico:787904334812807238>
*Note: Use `!grico` for a summary on how it works.*

⬥ Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> is an upgraded version of regular Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> that hits the target, as well 2 additional targets within a 6 tile radius. **Any hits not dealt to an additional target are instead dealt to the primary target at reduced effect**.
    • With Caroming 4 <:caroming4:791281588792590336>, the number of additional hits on the main target from <:gricocaroming:867678153966878740> can be increased up to 6, for **a total of 7 hits on the primary target**.
    • On a single target, the initial hit deals 65-75% damage, followed by two hits of 30-40%, and any extra hits from <:caroming4:791281588792590336> deal 10-15% damage each.

.
⬥ **This is the strongest ranged basic ability available**.
⬥ **It synergises well with multiple other ranged tools**:
    • Can build stacks faster when using arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513> <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> etc.
    • Provides many chances to critically strike when under a crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166>
    • Creates far more hitsplats when using weapon poison (and cinderbanes) <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812> <:weppoison:689525476158472288> due to increased hits per minute.
    • Can proc Perfect Equilibrium <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> twice in one cast, providing even more hitsplats.
    • Can greatly increase the chance of ammo procs <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> etc.
    • Deals great damage under ECB spec <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> due to how Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> healing works.

.
### __Greater Dazing Shot (GDS)__ <:mds:535541259033378827>
⬥ Greater Dazing Shot <:mds:535541259033378827> **deals the same damage as Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> but also applies a *Puncture* stack.**
    • *Puncture* deals bleed damage every 1.8s for 9s (4 times), with damage increasing per stack (caps at 10 stacks).
    • Using <:mds:535541259033378827> or <:stw:535541259109138463> refreshes this duration.
    • Splintering arrows <:splinteringarrows:900758234246299649> can be used to maintain stacks and increase the cap from 10 to 13 stacks.
    • The **extra hits from *Puncture* can trigger poison** <:poisonicon:944649693500154006> and so synergises well with poison-stacking methods.
    • It **can also help phase bosses**, saving time by not having to use an extra ability, a prominent example of this is Nex.
.
⬥ **Salt the Wound** <:stw:535541259109138463> deals damage based on the number of *Puncture* stacks.
    • The damage caps at 220-295% damage at 10 stacks, or 240-325% at 13 stacks with Splintering arrows.
    • **Can be strong early on**, but its usefulness begins to drop once you get access to more weapons' special attacks and abilities (<:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> / <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> / <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>). **It is not often used in end-game PvM scenarios.**

.
### __Shadow Tendrils__ <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>
⬥ Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> is a threshold **that deals a large amount of damage to the target in exchange for dealing some damage to yourself**.
    • Deals a total of 100-135% ability damage to the player → results in **200-270% ability damage** on target.
⬥ **The attack is guaranteed to crit, dealing extremely strong consistent damage**
⬥ The high ability damage **pairs very well with the Bow of the Last Guardian** <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> if lined up on a proc <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957>
⬥ The guaranteed crit can be used to get adrenaline if used after <:incend:535541258429661215> or <:tsunami:535533809995874304> or any other critical hit adrenaline buff.
⬥ The self-damage is not too significant, as it can be healed back with Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> very quickly.

.
### __Incendiary Shot__ <:incend:535541258429661215>
⬥ Incendiary Shot <:incend:535541258429661215> fires an arrow that explodes after 3 seconds, dealing **270-330% weapon damage to all targets in a 3x3 area,** also granting a critical hit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> - **all critical hits for 30s afterwards will give +8% adrenaline.**
    • If the main target dies before <:incend:535541258429661215> triggers, the effect will be lost.
⬥ **It can be used to setup pre-fight to execute stronger rotations**.
    • e.g. Use War's Retreat adrenaline crystals and Invention combat dummies to <:incend:535541258429661215> before the start of a fight like Raksha or Kerapac to have plenty of adrenaline in your opening ultimate rotation <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121>
⬥ **It can be set up mid-fight using Deathspore arrows <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>**, allowing for high uptime on the buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> without having to spend adrenaline to use it.
⬥ Deals a massive amount of damage on a single hit, making it a highly effective Perfect Equilibrium proc <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957>

.
### __Greater Death's Swiftness <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121>__
⬥ Greater Death's Swiftness <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> is an upgraded version of regular Death's Swiftness <:deathsswift:994921434633744455> that **increases the duration from 52t/31.2s to 65t/39s**, and **retains the damage-over-time effect**.
    • This effect may be replicated using the Planted Feet perk <:pf:689501925770919981> However, this loses the damage-over-time component and requires an extra inventory space.
⬥ The damage-over-time component can deal a moderate amount of damage, but it can also trigger other on-hit effects such as weapon poison <:weppoison:689525476158472288> <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812> making it stronger than it appears.

### __Seren Godbow (SGB) Special Attack__ <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>
*Note: See `!sgb` command for a list of boss sizes. For a full breakdown on how SGB special attack calculations work, and boss sizes, also see <#1020550599248466050>*
.
⬥ **The Seren Godbow <:sgb:626466665848242186> is primarily used for its strong special attack, which hits up to 5 times for large damage**.
    • Synergises well with <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>
⬥ The damage calculation for how <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> works can be summarised into the following scenarios:
    • Camping ranged: use it on **3x3 or bigger** targets.
    • Off-style switch: use it on **5x5 or bigger** targets.
⬥ Scales extremely well with target size, making it highly effective at bosses such as Zamorak <:zamorak:994914159969976440> and Arch Glacor <:archglacor:891948878583189514>
⬥ **On 5x5 or bigger targets, prioritise getting 2x <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028> under <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121>** where possible.
    • On 3x3 targets, it may be beneficial to only use it once and adjust rotation accordingly.

.
### __Eldritch Crossbow (ECB) Special Attack__ <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>
*Note: For a full breakdown on Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> healing works, see <#1020550599248466050>*
⬥ **The Eldritch Crossbow <:ecb:615618531937222657> is primarily used for its strong special attack, which causes all Soul Split healing <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> to instead damage the target for 4 times the amount it would have healed for 15 seconds.**
    • During this period, <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> will not heal.
⬥ The effect is tied to your main hand weapon - if you change weapons, the effect is lost.
⬥ An Amulet of Souls <:aos:513190158359724056> or EoF <:eof:787526151978614824> will boost the damage from Split Soul.
⬥ <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> adds a significant amount of 'free' damage that scales well with strong ability rotations.
⬥ **Prioritise abilities that hit for many (smaller) hits in <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>**:
    • Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>
    • Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> (can fit twice within 15s).
    • SGB special attack <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:spec:537340400273195028>
⬥ The Bow of the Last Guardian <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> benefits from <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028> as <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> adds a **lot** of frequent extra hits.
.
## > __Poison Build Rotations__ <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>
.tag:poison
Bik Arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>are extremely strong against poisonable targets with large HP pools (Solo Kerapac <:kerapac:875443920673337344> Solak <:solak:580167371310891029> 1-4k Arch-Glacor <:glacor:1004107344935923743>). At 200 stacks of Evolving Toxin <:evolvingtoxin:1240756218012893244> (400%), poison hit splats can output massive damage. This section covers tips and strategies to maximise the potential poison damage when using Bik Arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513>

.
### Preset and Synergy Considerations
.
⬥ Cinderbane Gloves <:cinderbanes:513190158355660812>, Weapon Poison (+++) <:weppoison:689525476158472288>, and Kwuarm Incense Sticks <:KwuarmSticks:565726489341984779> should all be used as standard poison damage buffs.
⬥ Blood Reaver <:reaverpouch:839903693837959228> synergises with Vampyrism Aura <:vampaura:643505653079343144> by proccing many extra reaver hits from the healing of Vampyrism, which in turn provides many additional chances to proc poison <:poisonicon:944649693500154006>
.
⬥ Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940> with Emerald Bakriminel bolts <:emeraldbakri:866551637714665484> performs very well when the target has 200 Evolving Toxin <:evolvingtoxin:1240756218012893244> stacks. It is slightly worse than using a Bow of the Last Guardian <:bolg:994189289623662702>, but is much less expensive.
⬥ Hitsplats of Split Soul, the Eldritch Crossbow special attack <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:spec:537340400273195028>, can also proc poison.
⬥ Scripture of Wen <:scriptureofwen:883134307902816297> hits can proc poison and is considered the best pocket slot item for poison builds.

.
### Ability Prioritisation
.
⬥ **At the start of a fight** the priority is to apply Bik Arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513> as often as possible to build to 200 stacks (400%) quickly.
    • <:grico:787904334812807238> / <:rapid:535541270521708566> / <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:piercing:535541258538450944> are all multi-hit abilities that will apply stacks rapidly.
    • Damage-over-time <:frag:535541273755385885> abilities only apply 1 stack of Evolving Toxin and should not be prioritised.
⬥ **Around 100** Evolving Toxin <:evolvingtoxin:1240756218012893244> stacks (200%), DoT abilities move up in priority for their ability to generate hitsplats to proc <:poisonicon:944649693500154006>
    • <:deadshot:535541307666595870> / <:corruptshot:535541306294796299> / <:frag:535541273755385885> are DoT abilities that can proc poison repeatedly.
⬥ **At maximum (200)** Evolving Toxin <:evolvingtoxin:1240756218012893244> stacks (400%) switch to an alternative ammo, only switching back to <:bikarrow:971025697235689513> to upkeep stacks.
    • You must land an ability with Bik Arrows <:bikarrow:971025697235689513> **at least once every 30 seconds** to upkeep stacks.
    • If continuing to camp a bow <:bolg:994189289623662702>, <:fularrow:971025696958853180> are generally used after max <:evolvingtoxin:1240756218012893244> stacks.
    • If utilising the Wyvern Crossbow <:wyverncrossbow:580177522587729940>, switch to Emerald Bakriminel Bolts <:emeraldbakri:866551637714665484>

.tag:advanced
This section is focused on best-in-slot rotations that make full use of all the tools that ranged <:range:580168050121113623> has to offer. Players looking to optimise around Bow of the Last Guardian <:bolg:994189289623662702>, Elite Dracolich Armour <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168>, and Wen arrows <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> in multi-ammo setups should navigate through this section.

### Bow of the Last Guardian <:bolg:994189289623662702>
Optimising Perfect Equilibrium <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> procs can result in some of the largest possible DPS increases for ranged <:range:580168050121113623>. To understand how to plan around this effect, it's important to keep in mind ranged ability hit-counts:

**Ordered in highest-to-lowest priority for lining up with a <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> proc:**
.
⬥ **Generates 1 stack:** <:incend:535541258429661215> / <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> / <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> / <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:deadshot:535541307666595870> / <:mds:535541259033378827>
⬥ **Generates 2 stacks:** <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:zammybow:1215929540908679208> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:piercing:535541258538450944>
⬥ **Generates 7 (3) stacks:** <:grico:787904334812807238>
    • It may be more helpful to think of <:grico:787904334812807238> as:
        ⬩ **generating -1 stacks** (first 4 hits proc <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> with 3 leftover)
        ⬩ **generating 3 stacks** (first 4 hits proc <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> with 3 leftover)
        ⬩ *Note: If outside of <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> thinking of it as 3 will **not work***
⬥ **Generates 8 (0) stacks: **<:rapid:535541270521708566>
    • Will put you back at the number of stacks you had before.
        ⬩ This is useful for keeping track of stacks post-rapid for <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> rotations.
        ⬩ Before <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> is obtained, can optionally be cancelled early to adjust stacks as desired.

.
It can be useful to think of your rotation as **blocks of abilities resulting in each <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> proc**, building up to 2-3 stacks with lower-damaging abilities such as <:grico:787904334812807238> / <:piercing:535541258538450944> / <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:mds:535541259033378827> and finishing off with a high damaging ability that also resets stack count.
⬥ **Example <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> blocks, starting from 0 stacks:**
    • <:piercing:535541258538450944> (2) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:zammybow:1215929540908679208> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:snap:535534127131394088> (4)

This is a simple method of thinking about <:bolg:994189289623662702> at first that may be easy to improvise around, but keep in mind **it's not always ideal to aim for exactly 4 hits at a time**. We may want to incorporate ability sequences such as <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> that leave us at 1 stack for the next block, but continuing to keep hit-counts in mind will allow us to continue proccing <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> on strong hitting abilities
⬥ Example: <:grico:787904334812807238> (3) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> (1) → <:piercing:535541258538450944> (3) → <:rapid:535541270521708566> (3) → <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> (4) → <:snap:535534127131394088> (2) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> (4) → <:grico:787904334812807238> (3) → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> (1)

.
**Tips**
⬥ When <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> is first used, **any number of stacks between 3-7** is adequate to proc the passive effect and be reset to 0 stacks.
⬥ <:incend:535541258429661215> **generates 1 stack on the tick it explodes**, meaning you have one global to adjust or stall stacks to line it up with a proc.
    • Examples:
        ⬩ (Starting from 1 stack)  <:incend:535541258429661215> → <:piercing:535541258538450944> → <:incend:535541258429661215> <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> explodes
        ⬩ (Starting from 2 stacks) <:incend:535541258429661215> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:incend:535541258429661215> <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> explodes
        ⬩ (Starting from 3 stacks) <:incend:535541258429661215> → <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> → <:incend:535541258429661215> <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> explodes.

*Any rotation examples from here on will also account for <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> stacks and so it is encouraged to pay attention to the hit-count of abilities on top of the relevant info from upcoming sections.*

### Elite Dracolich Armour <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168>
Elite Dracolich provides ranged <:range:580168050121113623> with a burst window to deal massive damage and generate adrenaline refunds with crit buffs <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> after full channelling <:rapid:535541270521708566>. With a well-planned rotation, this makes dealing damage to clear certain boss phases, such as at Zamorak <:zamorak:994914159969976440>, and generating Deathspore stacks <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> to highly reliably set up a free ultimate ability.

.
⬥ **With the full 5-set equipped, there will be a 4-global window** after <:rapid:535541270521708566> to make use of the buff, decreasing down to 2 globals with 3 pieces equipped.
⬥ A common use of this window is using **3 high damage adrenaline spenders <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> alongside <:grico:787904334812807238>** with an active crit buff <:critbuff:1279516151423963166> to regain the adrenaline to continue your rotation.
    • This <:grico:787904334812807238> has a very high chance of generating all 5 <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> stacks needed to use a free ultimate ability, typically <:incend:535541258429661215> if it isn't already active.
⬥ Prioritise using abilities such as <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:zammybow:1215929540908679208> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> / <:snap:535534127131394088> / <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> / <:grico:787904334812807238> during <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> buff.
⬥ It's generally expected to use **2x Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> per Death's Swiftness** <:gdeathsswift:994644354536837121> if boss mechanics and phasing allows it.
.
⬥ **Example <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> windows**:
    • <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:grico:787904334812807238>

### Wen Arrows <:wenarrow:971025697046925362>
Proper utilisation of the *Icy Precision* <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> buff from Wen arrows <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> is key to maximising the damage output of the style <:range:580168050121113623>. This section will go over how to smoothly build and spend Wen stacks <:icychill:1240756221024403526> within a rotation.

**Starting from 0 stacks:**
.
⬥ The most common way of building up Wen stacks <:icychill:1240756221024403526> is by using 2x <:grico:787904334812807238> with a basic such as <:mds:535541259033378827> or <:piercing:535541258538450944> in between the cooldown.
⬥ Wen stacks <:icychill:1240756221024403526> can be prevented from being consumed earlier than intended by swapping to a different ammo, such as <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> or <:fularrow:971025696958853180>, allowing us to continue using adrenaline spenders to fill the space.
    • Example: <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:grico:787904334812807238> (7) → <:fularrow:971025696958853180> <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:piercing:535541258538450944> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:mds:535541259033378827> (8) → <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:grico:787904334812807238> (15)
        ⬩ <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> and <:decimation:643848618477879328> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> do not consume stacks.

.
⬥ **The resulting buff <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> lasts for 6 globals (15 ticks)** upon consumption of max stacks. However, it's generally unfeasible to find the adrenaline for 6 back-to-back adrenaline spenders, so a <:grico:787904334812807238> during the buff may be necessary.
    • Example: <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099>

.
⬥ **With Elite Dracolich Armour** <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> the Wen stacks <:icychill:1240756221024403526> can be consumed by <:rapid:535541270521708566>, which will allow us to fully utilise the duration of the buff <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> since it will increase the damage of <:rapid:535541270521708566> as well.
⬥ **This will cause the buff <:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> to last for 3 globals after <:rapid:535541270521708566> ends.**
    • This combos well with the <:edracocoif:1179717359934640168> **window of 3 high-damage adrenaline spenders** followed by <:grico:787904334812807238>
    • Example: <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:sgb:626466665848242186> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> (<:icyprecision:1240756219187171419> ends) → <:grico:787904334812807238>
        ⬩ This then gives us another 7 Wen stacks <:icychill:1240756221024403526> to start building towards the next <:rapid:535541270521708566>
⬥ It may still be situationally useful to not consume stacks with <:rapid:535541270521708566>, in which case a swap to another ammo type during <:rapid:535541270521708566> is required.

.
**Wenspore** <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>
⬥ We may run into situations where we want to receive the effect of a certain ammo, such as <:wenarrow:971025697046925362>, **and** build <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> stacks on the same <:grico:787904334812807238>
⬥ By starting on <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> and inputting <:grico:787904334812807238> + <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> in that order on the same tick, we can build 7 <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> stacks and roll for chances at <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> stacks on hits 2-7 of <:grico:787904334812807238> and any ensuing <:perfectequilibrium:1006119102814887957> procs.
    • This works because any hits past the first on multi-hit abilities such as <:grico:787904334812807238> / <:piercing:535541258538450944> calculates their crit chance later than the initial cast
    • This can also be used to fish for the cooldown-reducing effect on <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642>
.
⬥ Example: <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:rapid:535541270521708566> → <:snap:535534127131394088> → <:dbow:643848618553507843> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:grico:787904334812807238> <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> → <:bolg:994189289623662702> <:spec:537340400273195028> → <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:piercing:535541258538450944> → <:mds:535541259033378827> → <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> <:incend:535541258429661215> → <:ecb:615618531937222657> <:eofspec:1257438999794946099> → <:wenarrow:971025697046925362> <:grico:787904334812807238> → <:rapid:535541270521708566>
    • This rotation is able to use the second <:rapid:535541270521708566> with 15 <:icychill:1240756221024403526> **and** proc <:deathsporearrows:900758234527301642> on <:incend:535541258429661215> in the same time frame

## __Weapon Overrides__
.tag:overrides
*Note: See `!override` for a summary.
**tl;dr - use Dart overrides for DW, blowpipe override for 2H**.*
.
### How It Works
⬥ Weapon overrides work by using a different weapon animation than the default one for your equipped weapon.
    • This can be done by keepsaking a different weapon type, or by using certain cosmetic overrides.
⬥ **Certain weapon overrides for Ranged can cause some abilities to hit 1 tick faster**, depending on 3 factors:
    • The distance between you and your target's NPC coordinate (also called 'true centre'). For targets ≥ 3x3 in size, this is their SW tile.
    • What weapon type you use to override.
    • What abilities are affected by that override.
⬥ This is **not** a general DPS increase, but can be used to get in an extra hit where otherwise not possible, due to mechanics.
    • It **can make Soul Split <:soulsplit:615613924506599497> flicking easier** to time.

.
### List of Overrides
*Note 1: The convention used here is that `MD` = `1 tile from target's true centre`, and `MD → X` means `from MD to X tiles from target's true centre` (e.g. `MD → 2` = `from MD to 2 tiles from target's true centre`)*
*Note 2: Greater Ricochet <:grico:787904334812807238> and Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> behave the same.*

⬥ **Javelins** (only main hand required):
    • Unload <:unload:535541258664411169> hits fast at MD → 3.
    • Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> and Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> hit fast at MD → 2.
    • Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> hit fast at MD.

.
⬥ **Darts** (only main hand required):

.
⬥ **Blowpipe** (2H override):
    • Dazing Shot <:mds:535541259033378827> and first hit of Deadshot <:deadshot:535541307666595870> hits fast at MD → 2.
    • Piercing Shot <:piercing:535541258538450944> and Ricochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> hit fast at MD → 5.
    • Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> and Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> hit fast at MD → 4.
