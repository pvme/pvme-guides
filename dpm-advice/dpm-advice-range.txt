.tag:revo++
**__Revo++__**
⬥ Revolution++ is 🔢😂 a combat mode wherein you can 💁 toggle the 💰 game 🎮 to automatically 🤖😩 activate basic, 🌑 threshold, 🤝🤝 and 👏👴 ultimate abilities automatically 😩 upon 😂👉 reaching the required adrenaline. 💉

.
⬥ While we 👥 do not encourage using 📤 Revo++ as 💑🍑 it limits the ⛓👏 amount 🔢📉 of 💦💦 control 🎮🏻 a 👌🏖 player 💰📅 has 👩🛒 over 😨⬆ their 🍆😂 own 😍 rotation, it is 🤚 low-input and 😤💼 low maintenance.

.
⬥ Revo++ can 🔫🔫 be ⚰ desirable for 🎅 afking, low-effort ⬇ pvm, or 💁 slayer 💦 tasks.

.
⬥ Here is 🅱 an ability 👉 bar 😫 we 👪 recommend for Revo++, using 🤳 this 🔜💻 bar 🥃🥃 with 👏 0 player 🤺👨 input will yield 🚫 ~130k DPM:
.img:https://i.imgur.com/6Fmy2MK.png

.
⬥ To toggle on Revolution++ 💥🔫 and 💆👉 highlight how ⚖ many 👧 abilities to 💰✌ trigger 😡 with it, 💦❔ click 🖱🖱 the 👏👀 clog icon on 👎🍆 your 🏻 ability 👉 bar: 😮🍻
.img:https://i.imgur.com/jCHwBgT.png

.
**__Basic Revolution__**
Basic Revolution 🔫🔫 (commonly 🅱 referred to 😯🙊 as 🅱😐 simply 😡 "Revolution") is a 💰👌 combat mode wherein basic 🌑🚂 abilities are used 🎶😏 automatically 🤖 by the game 🏈 but 🍑 threshold 🤝 and ultimate abilities are manually activated.

.
⬥ Newer players 🎮🎮 may 🏻 find 🔍 this 😂 combat 🗡 mode helpful 😲😁 starting 🍆🍆 out as 😰🍑 it 🏃 allows for 🍆😜 some 👨➕ control 🏻 over 😂🔚 your 👉 rotation but 🍑🍑 doesn't overburden you with managing basic 🌑😶 abilities.

.
⬥ Below ⬇ is 🅱😒 an ability bar 🥃😫 we 👥 recommend to use 📱 for revolution: 👺👺
.img:https://i.imgur.com/ZKwiC3l.png
.
    • Note 📝 that the 👏💰 thresholds and 💯➡ ultimate abilities can be 😱 placed in any order 🤜 as 👏👏 it does 👏 not ♂ matter 🌚 where 👏 they ♂👥 are 🍑💰 on 🅱 the 💬 bar 😮 − you ‼👧 will 🅱😘 be manually activating them. 👬 

.
⬥ If 💀👏 you 💯 are 😠 new ❓ to ✌ using 📤 revolution, 👺 simply 😡 let revo use basic 🌑🌑 abilities for you. 👈 
    • Activate Death Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> once you reach 100% adrenaline. 
        - From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088>, Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566>, Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, etc). Repeat.

⬥ Follow this 👈👇 simple 🌲 repeating pattern as a 🐝👌 standard base 🙄 to follow in 🔫🙅 Combat Dummies to 😫 reach 🤠 150k DPM: 
    • Build to 100% → Death Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912> → Thresholds → Repeat. One can expect to reach around 150k DPM with low to medium player input.

.
> **__Full Manual__**
.tag:Manual
**__Why to Use Full Manual__**
⬥ Full 😶 Manual is 👎🅱 a 🅰🔵 combat 🤼🏹 mode wherein all 💯🔎 abilities are manually activated by ⚡😈 the player.
    • No automatic inputs from 🏾 the 💞👧 game 🏀🎮 means no 😤 damaging abilities will ⚽ be 🚫 done, 🅱✔ therefore 👏🎉 this 🖖🏼 mode requires high ☝ input from 🛣😮 the 🎅😤 player.

.
⬥ The 👏 benefit 😩 of 💰 this ⬆ mode is that ❌👌 it allows for 🍆 the 📈👏 greatest ☺ degree 👅👅 of control over which abilities are used 🚟📅 in 😏 any ❌🤔 given ⤵ scenario.

.
⬥ Most high level 🔥👌 pvmers opt to use 😂 this combat ♂ mode.

.
**__How to Approach Using Full Manual__**
⬥ While 🤔♀ it 😩 does 😳🚫 not 🙅🙅 matter 🏻 where you 👈 place 😂🏡 your abilities on 🏽 your 👏👉 bar with full 👌💯 manual, you 🤓😫 may 💖 still 🙌 find 😱✔ it 😫😂 helpful to organize your 👨 bar 🍻 based on 👉 basics to 👏👱 thresholds to 👏💦 ultimate.
    • Refer to 🛑 the 🦃🥁 revolution 👺💥 bars 🔥⛓ as examples.

.
⬥ Transitioning from 🥃 revo to full 🌕💯 manual can ♂👀 seem intimidating but all 😂 it 🙅 takes 💜💜 is practice. 🎯🎯

.
⬥ Most 👥 players 📱 start 🕹💦 by letting ❌❌ revolution activate basics while 🏻 they 🏼 manually input thresholds and ultimates.
    • The 🐕 next step would 😜👪 be 🔹 to manually activate basic 😀😶 abilities too, 🍆 with 😂 revolution 💥 still active 🙌 as 🏃😴 a failsafe.
        - Once you 👉 feel 💞 confident in 🏡🌋 activating basic 😶 abilities manually, try turning 🙌 off 📴 revolution. 💥👺

.
⬥ An exercise 🤸♂ to ♀ help 💁💁 you 👍👆 here 🔥👉 is to only use ❌ basics for a 🚸 full minute ⌚ of 💦 combat on a 😪🎀 combat 🔫🤼 dummy.
    • Your goal ⬆🙍 is to 👌 not lose 😱 any 🤣💦 ticks between 👈🖕 basic 🌑 abilities, either 😗😤 due to cooldowns or 🏛 due 👅👅 to 😖 not manually activating the 👧👏 next ability fast ♂⚡ enough. 💦

.
⬥ Once you get comfortable at 🍆🤠 a combat 🗡🗡 dummy, ❤❤ try 😐 on 👇 a 🔫🎉 real 🎯💯 boss 😂🏽 such as 🅱 GWD1 (Graador/K'ril/Kree) or 🏛🍆 GWD2 (Vindicta).

.
*There is no easy "trick" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it!*

.
> **__Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation__**
.tag:prioritization
**__Ability Priorization__**
⬥ Generally 😄👀 speaking, 👏 high damaging abilities should 😤👍 be 🐝 prioritized and 🍟👖 used more often 💰💰 than low ⬇⬇ damaging abilities
    • However, 😐🤔 there's 💥✔ a 💯💰 catch. High 🔊🕛 damaging abilities often 😵💰 come with 😣👻 long 🍆 cooldowns.
        - If you 😟 use 👏❌ all 🥂😏 of the 👏 high 🆙 damaging abilities at once, 🔂👆 you will 😳 be forced to 💦 wait for 🎅 cooldowns before you may 🦋♀ use 🖐 them ❤🙊 again 💦🏼 – during 🚣 which time ‼⁉ you 😤 are 👀 forced 😩😲 to use low 👏 damage ☠☠ abilities.

.
⬥ To ✂🔭 circumvent this, the 🌾 trick 🔑 is to use 'filler abilities', abilities with 😍 decent damage AND short 💁 cooldowns, in-between 👇 your 👧 high 🆙👍 damaging abilities in ☝ order 📑❌ to 💦 pace your cooldowns.

.
⬥ See 🚨 this image 📸 for 👻😩 an idea of 👮 which 😩 abilities should 👑💘 be prioritized based 💰 on 🔛💯 damage ☄☄ (in 👉👄 a vacuum):
.img:https://i.imgur.com/4zBiGNb.png
.
*Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons.*

.
**__Building a Rotation__**
⬥ When building 🏗🏗 a 😍 rotation, ability 👉👉 prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on ♿🏽 your 🌈 mind.

⬥ Filler abilities such as Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> and Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe <:snipe:535541258425204770>, Corruption Shot <:corruptshot:535541306294796299>, Binding Shot-Flanking <:bindingshot:535541306563231790>, and Fragmentation Shot-Walk <:frag:535541273755385885>. 

⬥ Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability, such as Piercing Shot<:piercing:535541258538450944>, Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306>, Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880>, Binding Shot <:bindingshot:535541306563231790> without Flanking, Richochet <:ricochet:535541259566186521> on a single target.
    • Generally speaking, these 🖌 should 😀 be ♿🐝 avoided

.
⬥ If you are 2h or dual wield camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> or Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293>, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> or Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> as often as possible in your rotations. 
    • A basic pattern of Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> → Ability → Ability → Repeat is recommended for camping rotations.

⬥ For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle <:needle:535541259108876293> and Dazing <:dazing:535541307142307860> as filler abilities. Giving you access to stronger rotations. 
    • This lets ⛔⚠ you have 💢😬 more ⏫🍗 breathing 🐳 room 😜 in 👏🍑 what ❓ rotations and fillers you ✈ create. 📲📲
    • While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> → Ability → Dazing Shot (Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860> → Ability → Repeat will give you strong dps.

> **__Bakriminel Bolts__**
.tag:bakrbolts
Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide 💰😤 various effects which can 👏 be 🐝💨 very useful in 🙍 certain 🤔 pvm scenarios. If 👏 you 🐶🏾 are using 📤📤 bolt carrying weapons, it is 🙀 highly 🌿 recommended that ✔ you 🏻🥕 bring these bolts for 🍆 increased ➕➕ DPM.  

*Note: If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta*.

**__Ruby Bolts__** <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> 
Overall the best 🏆 bols for 💕👷 general 👮 PvM. A 👌 5% 😂🍆 chance 🚫 to ♀ activate, replacing a 🅱👌 hit 😤🔞 with ❌👏 a new one 😤☝ based 🏿🔥 on 🔛🚟 target's HP. The bolts have 👏🙌 a 👉 shared 👬 cooldown per 👼 target, making 👧🏽 them 👋👨 less ➖ effective (but still very powerful) in 😫😋 groups. The 🖥 HP to 💦 switch 🎚 at ❗ varies per 👼 target, and 👉 it ❔♀ is 🙅 recommended to 👋🔬 switch 🎚 to another 🚪 type ⌨⌨ of 🅱💦 bolt once ☝ the 👏 overriden hits 🎯👊 are 😟 lower 😤 than 👉👉 expected. 🍆🤰

*Note: Rubies are banned from combat dummy gems as its difficult to accurately measure your DPM with their effects.*

.
**__Onyx Bolts__** <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308>  
A 10% chance to activate, increasing damage by 25% on activation and healing for the same amount. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after Rubies <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> are no longer effective.

.
**__Hydrix Bolts__** <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> 
A 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness <:ds:535541258924326912>. 

.
> **__130k/140k DPM__**
.tag:one
**__Priorizing Thresholds__**
⬥ At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Death's Swiftness, if you haven't already, you should get a Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Death's Swiftness. 

⬥ Learning which thresholds to prioritize and use in an Ultimate is extremely important to maximize your dpm. It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Swiftness with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion. Not having a planted feet switch will also cut your ultimates short by 1 threshold, generally speaking. Its heavily recommended to familiarize yourself with the strength of your abilities in: <#562827048914124800>. 

*Note: This section assumes no Flanking Switches*

Your 🏧 threshold order 📑 in 🍆 Death's Swiftness should 😑😫 be:
⬥ **With Adrenaline Potion:**
Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>

⬥ **Without Adrenaline 💉💉 Potion:** 🍾🍾
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> → Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> → Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> → Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284>

.
> **__150k/160k DPM__**
.tag:two
**__Invention Perks__**
At this stage, pushing to the next will almost certainly require the usage of a Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> switch, as well as a Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> switch. Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows:

⬥ **With Adrenaline 💉 Potion:**
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088>  > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> > Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> > Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600> > Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> 


⬥ **Without Adrenaline 💉💉 Potion:**
Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> > Rapid Fire <:rapid:535541270521708566> > Snapshot <:snap:535534127131394088> > Tight Bindings <:tight:535541275957657600>

⬥ **Notes:**
    • We remove Bombardment <:bombard:535541306391265284> from our threshold rotations as they are all replaced with Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185>. 
    • Remember to use your Flanking <:flank4:712073088296157185> switch for basics, not just for thresholds. Using it on Binding Shot<:bindingshot:535541306563231790> improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 260% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players.

.
**__Weapon Switching__**
⬥ Once 🔂🏳 you're 🐶 at 😍👌 160k DPM, reaching 👉👉 higher levels 📊 of 💦💦 DPM will 📃 require either lots ✅ of min-max 🕑🕑 optimizations, or 💁💁 incorporating weapon 🔫⚔ switching. 🔥🔥 

⬥ Assuming you have been DW camping until this point, obtaining an SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> or a Decimation <:decimation:643848618477879328> bow will allow you to DW/2H switch without switching ammo. 
    • Start focusing on never using an ability worse than 157% ability damage. Any Tuska's Wrath <:Tuskas:513201065513058306> or Sacrifice <:Sacrifice:513201065907322880> in your rotation should be swapped for a Dazing Shot <:dazing:535541307142307860>. 

⬥ Maintain the same threshold order in Death's Swiftness and remember to Needle Strike <:needle:535541259108876293> before Snap Shot <:snap:535534127131394088> and Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> for higher damage. 

⬥ From 💦 this point 😟 onwards we 👉❣ will 👏🙅 also incorporate ways 😉😉 to 💦🏃 force 😨🙅 auto 🤖🤖 attacks.
    • For Death's Swiftness, using a dw MH for Planted Feet <:pf:689501925770919981> then switching to 2H will also force an auto attack, which can contribute significant damage. Sometimes clicking your target is necessary to force the auto attack. The sequence of actions goes as follows: 
        - Equip DW PF → Activate Death's Swiftness <:DeathsSwift:513190158812839936> → Equip 2h within GCD → Click target (auto attack will come out here) → Activate Ability.

⬥ Using Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> with 2H after using a DW ability with a 'fastest' speed weapon allows for stacking an auto on top of the tendrils.

**__Bakriminel Switching__**
⬥ If ☝ you would 🌨😏 like to 👋 progress further up 🙇 you 👈🏾 will 🤔🅱 have to 💦 learn 🎓📚 Bakriminel Bolt switching.

⬥ Various bolts provide 💰💰 a variety of 👨 effects which can be 🐝 useful under 👇⬇ different 💰↔ circumstances . Since 👨👨 Rubies are 🔢👴 our 💰 primary bolt and have 👏👍 an innate cooldown, we 👩 can 🔫🔫 bypass any 💦💦 downtime by 🌈 switching 🔥 to 👵💩 another 🏊 bolt to 💦🛏 get the 🚨 most 💯 out 🤷💯 of 💦 their effects at 😠 any 🤷 given time.
    • Bolt switches are 💓 usually done between 😉 the 👏 three meta bolts: Ruby, Onyx, and Hydrix. 
        - The 🍃 idea 👌 is to ⏱💀 pick ⛏ two or 📉💁 three bolts for 🏻 a 🐖 given 👈 scenario to 💦👅 minimize downtime between bolt cooldowns and 🙄 to 📖 maximize their 🍆 effects. 

⬥ For example, the most effective bolt when fighting <#534612663523737619> <:Nex:513213159071547395> are Ruby bolts <:RubyBakri:565726489413287956> as they are the best dps bolts. 
    • However, when attacking minions the most effective bolt becomes Hydrix <:HydrixBakri:550834403136503822> as minions have a soft hitcap of 1000 so any Ruby procs are wasted. 
        - During the last phase, the most effective bolt on Nex becomes Onyx <:OnyxBakri:565726489362956308> as she is lower than 100k hp thus reducing Ruby's effectiveness.

.tag:Tendril
**__What Makes It Special__**
Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, despite deal damage, acts as a non-damaging ability with a couple caveats.
⬥ This ⬇ allows you 🤷 to 😱 use what 😮 is colloqually referred to as 🍑🍑 "Defensive Autos" with it.
    • These 🈴 are 👴 simply lossless autos that 😐 fire 🔥 during 🚣 non-damaging 🏆🚫 abilities as 🖇😴 they 🙆♂ do 😤 not reset your Auto 🤖🤖 cooldown.

.
**__How It Works__**
⬥ To get your Auto with Shadow Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> you must perform a non-channeled fastest speed weapon ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.
    • For example, Needle <:needle:535541259108876293> with Blightbound Crossbows <:bbc:626714879218155521> <:bbcoh:626714879230738434>.

.
⬥ To further make use of this interaction, you want to ensure that this Auto is a 2h-Auto, such as SGB <:sgb:626466665848242186> or ECB <:ecb:615618531937222657>, or Dbow <:dbow:643848618553507843> (where accuracy permits).
    • To do this, simply swap to your 2h after your ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>, or swap to your 2h directly as you or after you cast Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416>.

**__Differences From Typical Non-Damaging Abilities__**
As 🏿 mentioned prior, 🔙 there are 👌💰 some 🖤🅱 caveats to this 👈 ability 👉 and they are 👴 as 🛠🅱 follows: 🚗
⬥ You cannot delay the Auto with Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> like other Defensive Autos.

⬥ Fast ⌚ speed ⏩⏩ weapons do not ❌🤔 work like with 👦😶 other 👪 Defensive Autos.
    • Thus, the non-channeled ability before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> must be fastest.

⬥ You have to spam click if you want to get Auto after Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> if you offed for some reason before it, though clicking once before Tendrils <:shadowtend:642713547142332416> works too.
